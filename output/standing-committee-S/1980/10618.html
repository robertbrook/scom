	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We last debated this particular group of Estimates on 26 July 1977. On that occasion the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), the present Secretary of State for Scotland, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the cost of supporting public transport is bound to fall upon Government and public finance generally, in this country as in most others.—	<i>[Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26 July 1977; c. 49.]</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State is noted for saying rather pedestrian and commonplace things with an air of great conviction, but on this occasion it is not a bad starting point for our debate. I certainly agree with him that the cost of supporting public transport is bound to fall upon the Government and upon public finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a burden that is almost inescapable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at these Estimates, we are in a very real sense talking about resources. The tragedy is that in many areas there is a great deal to be done and precious little with which to do it as a result of the Government's general approach to local government finance and to public sector finance. The system undoubtedly is in the tails, and the tragedy is that in the background all we hear from the Government are jarring and petulant lectures about economy, the virtues of self help and the philosophy of make do and mend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a vast area and I cannot cover it in any comprehensive way without hopelessly overtaxing the patience of my hon. Friends, but I want to raise a number of specific issues with the Minister and, more in a spirit of optimism than confidence, invite some specific replies from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, can I ask him to look at railway investment. I realise he is not directly responsible for that in the broad sense, but, of course, we do have the Strathclyde passenger transport executive and I would like him, if he would, to address his mind to the problem of reinvestment there. As I understand it, rolling stock
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
and other assets are depreciating very rapidly. We have an enormous amount of equipment which now, in the words of one top railway official talking to me the other day, can only be described as clapped out. We have DMUs and EMUs, which are 25 or 30 years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, if we look at the capital budget for the Strathclyde region in terms of transportation and roads, we are looking at a figure in the present financial year of £50 million. If we assume that £36 million of that is going on roads, we are left with a mere £14 million to subsidise the running of public transport—the railways and the buses. There is genuine anxiety among officials as to how they are expected to finance the kind of reinvestment in the railways with the money that the Government are making available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a general problem. We know that at the moment, unless we get an increase in investment in railways generally in Scotland of about 30 per cent., we are almost certainly going to be faced with deteriorating services in the years that lie ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular question about Strathclyde is: who pays? It is time that the Under-Secretary put a little flesh on the bones and told us how the substantial replacement costs that will occur over the next few years will be met. I wish that the Government would spend a good deal more time wrestling with the problems of railway policy generally than with some of the irrelevancies that seem to take up so much of their attention. For example, we had the recent knock-down sale of assets in the form of three very prominent Scottish hotels. If those transactions had been carried out on the same basis by a public company, I suspect that the directors might well have been in default of their responsibility to their shareholders. I wish that we could get away from that kind of ideological nonsense and look at the great problems of deteriorating services because of lack of proper investment in public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could I ask the Minister to say a few words about the Kilmacolm line and the Scottish Office's attitude to it? I know that it comes under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State for Transport, but presumably Scottish Office Ministers have considerable influence and interest in what is to happen there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going back to the speech of the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) in 1977, I was interested to note that in col. 52 the right hon. Gentleman specifically said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On lines where the losses are so great that the burden on British Rail is too great, and where the local authority can make only a limited contribution, which may not be quite enough to keep the line open, there is a major role for regional development funds."—	<i>[Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26 July 1977; cols. 52-53.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to say that the Government—in those days it was the Labour Government—should make regional development funds available in order to save a line in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Transport Users' Consultative Committee has definitely recommended that this line should be retained. I hope that the Minister will use every power at his disposal to ensure that it is retained, and that the Government will take the admirable advice that the now Secretary of State gave in that debate in 1977 and will find the cash. Clearly it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
be unreasonable to put that burden on a PTE which is already heavily overstrained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final matter I should like to mention is electrification. I see in the press this morning that it is alleged that the Cabinet has decided in principle to go ahead with electrification. I would not quarrel with that. In fact, I welcome it. It is perhaps unreasonable to expect the Minister who is to reply to our debate—who, after all, labours very much in the kitchens—to know exactly what is happening in the salons upstairs in Downing Street, but at least he ought to be able to say something about the priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged to think that one of the top priorities will be the electrification of the Ayr line. If we get the kind of impartial approach to the problems of that area that was instanced when we were looking at the colleges of education, for example, I think that we may be able to hold out a great deal of hope for early action on the Ayrshire line. It is nonsense not to be pushing ahead with that kind of infractructure investment while the dole queues grow longer. We are using North Sea oil revenue to fund unemployment and we are not getting on with projects, such as electrification, which would bring a very substantial benefit in the years that lie ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Craigen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that since my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gar-scadden (Mr. Dewar) was present at the lobby by the British Rail Engineering workshop workers earlier this year, he would agree that electrification of these lines would have immense possibilities for that type of employment in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The BREL would certainly welcome it. We know that there is one little bit of electrification—the spur into the BREL workshops in Springburn. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) and the work force in that area are very anxious about that. We at least want some general indication of the Scottish Office's attitude on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not an absolute divide between members of the Committee but I believe that there is a genuine difference of approach to the whole question of public transport in Scotland. I believe that we must really try to break out of this strait-jacket because of the present situation of rising costs, higher fares and fewer passengers. I do not believe that the Government are showing enough energy or imagination in their approach to these endemic problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the figures I have for Strathclyde. If we look at the number of passenger journeys on PTE's own buses, the Scottish Bus Group in Strathclyde and British Rail within Strathclyde, we can see that since 1977 the number has declined from 464 million to 421 million. One of the reasons for that decline is the heavy escalation in costs forcing up fares to a point where they are a genuine social burden and a great economic disadvantage to countless thousands of families, particularly on the edges of our conurbations and in rural settings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes the average fare in Strathclyde as 100 on 1 January 1976, by the end of 1980 that figure had risen in the passenger transport executive's bus services to 194, in the Scottish Bus Group to 222 and in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
British Rail to 240—a very substantial increase. I believe this underlines the need not to sit back and watch this terrible strait-jacket tightening with all the consequences that would follow from it, but to look in a more adventurous way at these problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I also make the point that those increases make nonsense of the Government's argument and major plank in their election campaign that they wish to increase the gap in terms of earnings between those who work and those who do not, because, every time transport costs are increased, the person who has to travel to work has to pay, very much more and actually loses out in real terms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. My hon. Friend will know all about this phenomenon from his own constituency, as I do from mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are looking for is some sort of initiative, some sort of flexibility, in the Government's approach. I do not want to go at any great length into individual examples, but I think that I am bound to mention the Lothian experience on this occasion. We know that, since the autumn of 1976, there has been a freeze on bus fares within the old Edinburgh city undertaking. At the moment we have an annual loss of £8.3 million, which is offensive to the Government and is one of the main planks on which they have based their vendetta. In fairness, I think that an additional cost should be added to that—the cost of running a totally free concessionary fare system for old-age pensioners, the handicapped and the disabled. But whether one endorses that as a policy or thinks that it is too bold, I think we have reached the point where we must be prepared to experiment. We must test the theory that, by holding down fares, or at least cushioning the impact of rising costs, people can be tempted back on to the public transport and thus do something to preserve the fare revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I should say that, with a penny rate product of almost £2 million, the figures here are not quite as sensational or damaging as some of the more hysterical comments of Government supporters would suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is quite wrong to treat as some form of 	<i>per se</i> criminal irresponsibility any local authority which tries to move in the direction of these experiments which are now commonplace in many parts of the country. I am particularly glad, for example, that in Strathclyde we are moving towards the travel card experiment this summer, which is another experiment in attempting to attract passengers back by competitive marketing within the fare structure. It is interesting to see that in Strathclyde the PTE meets 80 per cent, of its revenue costs from fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at Lothian and takes revenue as including compensation for the concessionary fare scheme, of the total current revenue costs of £28 million, £20 million are recovered in fares. No one would think that that was unreasonable, give that, for example, within the Strathclyde PTE area, British Rail's percentage of costs recovered in fares is only 54 per cent. I say that to put the matter in perspective. It should not be derided and swept away. Given the appalling problems of sitting and doing nothing and watching the logic of the dilemma of rising costs and falling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
usage continuing, I believe we must be a good deal more flexible in our approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gavin Strang 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to focus attention on the remarkably successful Edinburgh bus service operated by the Lothian region. The actual overall cost of public transport subsidies in Lothian, include the free bus service for pensioners, the subsidised fares, and the money which the Secretary of State has prevented us from spending on subsidising the bus service outside Edinburgh, amounts to 5.45p per day for the average householder with the average rateable value compared with 38p per day for education. When one looks at what one gets for that and at the fact that one can travel from the outskirts to the centre of Edinburgh for 20p—for a whole family—it is a remarkably cost-effective service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As I said, I do not want to argue the case in detail. I am merely making the general point that there is a case to be argued, and that we should not allow ideological prejudice and political vendetta to dismiss out of hand something that deserves serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hurry on to the ferry services, particularly those which serve the islands of Scotland. Will the Minister say something fairly definitive about the road equivalent tariff? I say that because, in the first careless rapture of the days when they were making up their manifesto and in the heady days of tax cuts and galvanised entrepreneurs, the Minister committed himself to a road equivalent tariff system. The Committee may remember that in the early months of this Government he was bustling up to Norway to improve his education in these subjects, having realised that he was committed to it. Perhaps it would have been better to find out about it before he made the commitment, but we must not discourage the enthusiasm of the naive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then there has been a great silence, we have said from the very beginning that there were substantial practical difficulties in applying a rigid mathematical formula to ferry services. Those islands further away with longer journeys may suffer as a consequence. But even if the Government intend to welsh on that commitment, at least it is time that we knew.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the debate on 19 January 1981 on one of the temporary bridging orders, if I may put it that way, giving help to specific lines—in particular, the Glenlight shipping company. The Minister will find the following passage in his own speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the subject of RET, I deny any question of undue delay on the part of the Government. We issued a consultative document last summer and we said at the time, and we have said ever since, that at the beginning of this year we would announce our conclusions on the consultations that we would have. While the hon. Member for Garscadden is undoubtedly correct in saying that today constitutes the beginning of the year, so will next week, and perhaps even next month. 'The beginning of the year' is the phrase that the Government used, and we did not indicate any specific date. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that that commitment will be kept in the terms that it was given."</p></blockquote>
It may be that I was a little over-eager. Perhaps I made the mistake of taking literally what the Minister said—that we should have the result at the beginning of the year. We are now in the second half of June and, however much we stretch the term "the beginning
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
of the year", I think that I am entitled to look for that commitment being honoured. The Minister said
	<br><blockquote><p>"that commitment will be kept in the terms that it was given,"—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 19 January 1981; Vol. 997, c.126.]</p></blockquote>
If there is one answer which I specifically want and to which I am entitled, it is that particular answer about the road equivalent tariff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also ask him—perhaps in a spirit of optimism, but it is important—about the Government's policy on Caledonian MacBrayne, Western Ferries and particularly the Dunoon-Gourock route? The Minister knows that for a long time rumours have been circulating, and they surfaced in concrete form in the 	<i>Sunday Standard</i> of 31 May in a front page article which stated specifically that the Government were thinking of taking the subsidy on the Dunoon-Gourock run away from Caledonian MacBrayne and giving a subsidy of £535,000 for the coming year to Western Ferries. It is not unreasonable that the Minister should either confirm that that is the Government's intention or lay to rest this rumour altogether. Let me warn him that if he is thinking of taking Caledonian MacBrayne off that route, he will have to produce secure assurances as to the level of service that will replace it. There will be a smell of the "old boy" network if the taxpayer is asked to be the Seventh Calvary riding to the rescue of Sir William Lithgow and Western Ferries, a company which, on the figures I last saw in 1978 and 1979, was making substantial losses. It made a trading loss on 1978 of £149,000 and in 1979 of £371,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the fact that Western Ferries is just picking and choosing a route and not giving a blanket service of the kind that Caledonian MacBrayne gave, I should take it amiss, and so would many of my hon. Friends, if £500,000 of the taxpayers' money were to subsidise Sir William and his colleagues in their somewhat shaky venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, Western Ferries is not really interested in the people who use and commute on that line. Western Ferries uses a terminal which is inconvenient for any passenger traffic. It uses boats which have been described to me by a regular user as no more than floating car parks. There would be no guarantee about continuity of service, back-up boats and frequency. If there is to be this prejudiced move on the part of the Government, we shall want very watertight guarantees. We certainly want to know what is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Mackay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if he had talked to any body about this he would have discovered that two-thirds of the vehicle traffic on this route goes on the Western Ferries service? In addition, Western Ferries runs a service which runs longer in the day and later at night. In fact, it is far better for the car traveller, lorry traveller and so on than Caledonian MacBrayne.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the view of the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Mackay) who is a noted critic of Caledonian MacBrayne's and is on the record at one point as saying that it should just pack up and go. I know many people who use that service. I think that I am fairly representing anxieties which can be seen expressed in any issue of the local press and by anybody who travels regularly. But I am glad, at least, for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
implied concession that the present service by Western Ferries is totally inadequate from the point of view of the pedestrian passenger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn briefly and finally to the matter of the roads budget. In the 1977 White Paper on transport policy Cmnd. 6836—which was produced by the Labour Government, it was made clear that we favoured a turn away from the perhaps capital-inte-sive, prestige, major road-building project to try to do something to improve the public transport service. There was to be a shift in emphasis. I believe that that shift was absolutely right, and I support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is alarming in the Government's White Paper on public expenditure 1980/81 to 1983/84 is that we see there is to be a substantial decline in the total programme that will be available for roads. If we look at the Government side, we see that in 1978/79 it was £92 million and that it is to fall by the end of the period I mentioned to £80 million. If we look at the local authorities side it falls in the same year from £291 million to £250 million. This, of course, is a reduction in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Library produced some interesting figures for me the other day. They show that while over the last two or three years we have been spending less each year per capita on roads in Scotland, the trend in the United Kingdom as a whole has been the reverse, so that we have a situation where our total resources are slipping. I think the Government have much to answer for in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is not the big project that worries me. It is the maintenance and maintaining of the standards of the roads that presently exist. For example, the Strathclyde roads authority is now spending 30 per cent, less every year in real terms than it was in the first year of regionalisation. One can literally see in almost any road of any constituency in Strathclyde the results of the parsimony which has been enforced by Government policy. It has a direct result upon employment. In 1975/76, the first year after regionalisation, that authority employed 4,200 manual workers. It now employs 3,500. The Government prate on about keener, slimmer, and more efficient finer-tuned Departments. But I have talked extensively to people in that department and they say that the answer at the end of the day has been a lower standard of service to the public, and one which can almost be measured.

Yesterday at Question Time the hon. Member for Argyll referred to a firm called Tilcon which has been protesting to him about rates. But Tilcon has just closed the Dumbuck quarry outside Dumbarton with the loss of 30 jobs. I do not necessarily blame the company. It may have been commercial logic which it could not escape. But the commercial logic was dictated by the fact that the budget in terms of its principal customer for road coatings, Strathclyde, had dropped by 30 per cent. It is a bad situation in terms of employment and service. We talk on occasions about the personal social services, but there is something very personal indeed about an accident caused by a pothole, and, thanks to the Government's policies, we are now suffering in all parts of the region from an epidemic of potholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot really cover any other areas in my introductory remarks, but I know that many of my hon. Friends have specific topics which they want to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
My own view is that the mark of this Administration has been decay in the public sector. The attack used to be encapsulated in the phrase "private affluence and public squalor". As far as public squalor is concerned, the Government have made a pretty good fist at it; but when it comes to private affluence they have fallen disastrously short of their targets. One of the tragedies is that they are presiding over a deterioriation of public transport services at a time when in the private sector it is much harder for the private motorist to maintain and keep his vehicle on the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 1979, according to the AA, the month after the Government came to power, a 10,000-mile driven 1,500 cc car cost 15.5p per mile to run and keep on the road. In 1981 it is 21. 1p per mile—an increase of well over one-third. So we have the private motorist being hit, the private transport section being hit and at the same time as we have deterioration in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1979, petrol was 78p per gallon. It is now approaching the 160p mark. When people open their newspapers and see BNOC knocking 4 dollars-plus off the cost of a barrel of oil, when they see OPEC reducing oil prices, and when they read about a world glut in petrol, they wonder exactly what is happening and what responsibility the Government bear for the present chaotic situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will produce tendentious arguments. I have no doubt that there will be delicately selected facts and that questionable statistics will be dusted down. But at the end of the day it is a very sad and depressing picture of rising costs, deteriorating services and inadequate investment. Given the kind of grudging and inhibited approach to public sector finance and the real needs of the public transport sector, I do not believe that there is any real chance of the answers coming from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was correct that this is the first debate on transport we have had in this Committee since 1977. Given that it has been the first opportunity for the Opposition to indicate their own transport policy at any time since the general election, the hon. Gentleman's speech was significant in that there was not even a glimmering of an alternative transport policy strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman predicted with absolute accuracy that I would burden the Committee with some statistics. He did not, however, confess that his own speech was largely an accumulation of partial statistics brought together to try to maintain that the transport services in Scotland had declined over the past two years. I shall be able to demonstrate with considerable ease that, far from having seen a deterioration, we have seen in particular areas of need substantial and dramatic improvements far in advance of anything that the Labour Government produced. In particular, those communities in the Highlands and Islands and in the rural areas, which depend more than others on transport facilities, have benefited substantially at a time of overall reduced expenditure throughout the public sector. I shall demonstrate that without any difficulty whatsoever.

Only in his concluding remarks did the hon. Gentle

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
man start making references to the private sector and the private motorist. It is important to remember that the private motor car is not a luxury in the 1980s; it is a facility which the vast majority of our community believe to be a necessary part of their ordinary daily lives. Indeed, one of the major advantages of the past 30 years has been that the motor car, instead of being the privilege of the few or of the rich, is now taken for granted by a very large section of ordinary people as being part of their transport needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the private and public sectors in transport, the initiatives introduced by the Government improving the level of competition in transport have already been shown to be of enormous benefit. We have seen over the years how Freddie Laker and Adam Thomson, by bringing private enterprise and initiative into what would otherwise be State monopolies, have brought about dramatic improvements not only in the service and choice available to the public but in the level of service provided by the public sector which, faced with the spur of competition, has been obliged to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transport Act came into effect only a few months ago. Yet, the advantages of competition—and of competition by the private sector—have been shown to be quite dramatic. Take, for example, the substantial improvement in the bus services offered to the Scottish public on the Glasgow to London and Edinburgh to London routes. Last summer, before the Transport Act came into effect, the Scottish Bus Group's single fare for the Glasgow to London run was £11.50. Shortly after the Transport Act came into force, private operators introduced alternative schemes at a considerably lower fare, and the Scottish Bus Group immediately—for the first time for many years—reduced its fares from £11.50 to £8.50, where it stands at the present time. That substantial reduction came about solely because a private enterprise firm was able to offer a comparable service at a much lower price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a very dramatic and graphic fashion we can see how the introduction of competition has not only given choice to the public, but has actually brought down prices in the public sector in a way which is in everyone's interests. Clearly it has been in the interests of the Scottish public as a whole. That is fact and statistic, I do not apologise for it, because it it something which the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will have to appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made reference in considerable detail to the position of the railways in Scotland. He will appreciate that the railways are not a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, but the Scottish Office does naturally take very great interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman posed certain specific questions to me. The Kilmacolm line is a matter for the Secretary of State for Transport. Both he and my right hon. Friend have indicated that the views of the STUCC—in particular, the question whether there will be hardship to commuters—will be one of the factors that will be taken primarily into account before any final decision is taken by the Secretary of State for Transport on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrewshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is on a question dear to my heart. The ques
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
tion is to what extent is the Scottish Office bringing pressure to bear upon the Secretary of State for Transport and making the case that has been made by the people in the West of Scotland in relation to that line, particularly the social institutions on the line—mental hospitals, education colleges and quarriers' homes—at 24 different points? These are the points that the Scottish Office is in the happy position to bring forward and to press upon the Secretary of State for Transport. We need to know to what extent it is putting forward the social needs of that community to the Secretary of State for Transport so that the unanimous decision of the STUCC is upheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have already said that the Scottish Office is fully involved with the Department of Transport in ensuring that all these relevant considerations are borne in mind when the Secretary of State for Transport takes a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The electrification of the railway line is, in the Glasgow area in the first instance, a matter for the regional council. My right hon. Friend met the regional council some time ago. We have indicated that, once it has come to a decision, we will certainly see what help can be given and will seek to respond as sympathetically as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lambie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Central Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely in this transport debate the Minister should make a definitive statement on the electrification of the Ayrshire lines. Yesterday I received an answer from the Secretary of State stating that he would consider sympathetically the problem of Strathclyde regional council. Strathclyde regional council will be taking a decision within the next two or three weeks. Yesterday we had the Cabinet decision to go ahead with partial electrification of the main railway lines. Why does the Minister not give us an answer today? If he cannot give us an answer, why does he not bring his right hon. Friend to do the job? Why are we suffering an office boy? The Secretary of State should be here to give the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have had an opportunity to scrutinise the minutes of yesterday's Cabinet meeting; I am afraid I have not had that privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, the hon. Gentleman cannot answer the question. I move that we suspend the sitting and ask the Secretary of State to give us the details. Everyone who reads the newspaper knows what goes on in the Cabinet, but the Under-Secretary does not. He should resign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only remember with a great deal of pleasure that the hon. Gentleman's rather barbed comments were made with equal profusion when his right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millar) was Secretary of State and with equal demands for his resignation. As his right hon. Friend tended to ignore the advice, he will forgive me if I also react in a similar way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lambie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a waste of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Garscadden raised the ques-

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
tion of the transport policies of Lothian region and sought to put them before the Committee. We are not in any way wishing to tell Lothian region how it should use the expenditure available to it. If it wishes to spend more on transport and is able to make savings elsewhere, that is a matter for Lothian to decide. It has to decide its own priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government are entitled to take a view on the total level of expenditure, and that is the difference between my right hon. Friend and that regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would point out, as it is of relevance to this whole issue, that the average amount which the rest of Scotland, including many Labour authorities, spends per capita on concessionary fares is £4.55. In Lothian, it is £13.86. On general public transport subsidy the amount which is spent by the rest of Scotland, including many Labour authorities, is £11.44. In Lothian it is £20.01. Therefore, in an area of Scotland which cannot claim to be the area with the greatest needs or the greatest deprivation, we find a far higher level of expenditure per capita than in the rest of Scotland, and that is putting an enormous burden on the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary admit that there is no way that the Lothian region can meet the Secretary of State's demand that it should cut its expenditure by £53 million in the current year without decimating services, whether transport, education, social work or anything else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would advise the hon. Gentleman to speak not to his Labour colleagues, but to the officials of Lothian region. Perhaps he would like to seek their advice—no doubt in private—[Hon. Members: "Oh"]—or in public. I do not mind. Anyone who looked at the enormous growth in expenditure in the Lothian region over the years and its refusal to make cuts, either under this Government or under the Labour Government, of which he was a member, which pressed the Lothian region to reduce its expenditure, would be in no doubt that that region, if it had the will, could make cuts running into many millions of pounds with minimal redundancies and minimal effect on the vital services to the community. The vast majority of the people of the Lothian region have come to a similar conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Henderson. Surely, the Under-Secretary of State is in grave breach of privilege and a number of other things in suggesting that hon. Members should consult the officials of a local authority in order to seek advice and information contrary to that given by the elected representatives of the authority. It seems to me to be a disgraceful situation. I hope that you will direct him to withdraw that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's opinions are for himself, not for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Henderson. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), who has been in frequent contact with the officials of his own local authority—and, doubtless,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
of other local authorities—always takes that into account when he makes representations either to the Government or to the House of Commons. That is something that all hon. Members are entitled to do and do frequently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order Mr. Henderson. That is not the point that we are discussing. The Minister said that people should consult officials in order to get a different view from that being put forward by the elected authority. I do not ask officials in my area to sneak me some different point of view from that maintained by the council. I get from them the factual information on which my local authority has based its decision. The hon. Gentleman is out of order. It seems to me a kind of lese-majeste, let alone a breach of the privilege that he enjoys as a Member of the House and as a Minister. I wish that he would have the decency to withdraw that statement. He should be congratulating the Lothian region on maintaining services, not attacking it in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows as well as anyone that Minister's opinions are not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn now to the question of shipping services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two very brief points. The Minister referred to averages, said that the transport average in Lothian per head was £20 and suggested that stood out on its own. He will see from the rating review that Strathclyde spends £17.27, which is not so very different, and I think that ought to be on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would he also accept that the logic of the remarks he has just made is that any Back Bencher should be able to approach his officials to try to get private information contrary to the advice that is given to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is of significance that Strathclyde—an area with substantially greater deprivation than any other part of Scotland—nevertheless does not feel the need to spend per capita as much as Lothian does. Indeed, when one looks at fares, one finds that Strathclyde—which has made increases in its fares to take account of increases in inflation over the years—is in stark contrast to Lothian where no change has been made since 1976.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for hon. Members to decide for themselves how they wish to act. I am pleased to give advice of that kind.

I turn now to the question of shipping services raised by the hon. Member for Garscadden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Henderson. The Minister has made an outrageous slander on many officials in the Lothian region. He must name names. If it is untrue, he must withdraw the allegation, I do not believe that those officials are a fifth column for this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Henderson. A very serious statement has been made that Westminster politicians can go under the heads of an elected local authority and

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
approach its officials directly. I have always understood throughout all my local Government experience that an officer's first allegiance was to his local authority. This very serious statement has been made, and we are not getting an answer to the position of Government officials who are accountable to a Minister. If the Minister continues to make disgraceful comments of the kind that he has made this morning, there are those of us who will protest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Henderson. May I make it clear that I have spoken to Lothian region officials—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Oh".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That does not seem to be a point of order for the Chair to rule upon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a final point of order, Mr Henderson. The position has been defined by the Minister. Surely, by the same analogy the Committee is now entitled to have speeches made by the officials who are present today advising the Minister. Will he ask them now to speak to the Committee on the true position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That proposition would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, may I clarify one point. There is no conflict between the advice that I am getting from Lothian region council officials, including the chief executive, and the controlling group on Lothian region. I think it is very worrying that apparently the junior Minister and his officials are under the impression that one can save £53 million without making thousands of public service workers redundant in Lothian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has at least agreed that it is perfectly normal and appropriate for him or for me or for any other hon. Member to speak to his local authority officials. He has done so, I have done so, and I am sure that all hon. Members have done so in their own areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn, if I may, to the question of transport and deal specifically with the question of shipping services which the hon. Member for Garscadden raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I first refer to the Gourock-Dunoon route on which he dwelt for some time. There have been negotiations involving the Gourock-Dunoon route. We hope to reach a decision, which will obviously be announced, in the near future. I am not able to give details at the moment, but discussions have been going on with a view to ensuring a proper service to the community in that area and also proper accountability to the public. We will obviously make any announcement that is appropriate in the very near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general question of shipping services, the hon. Gentleman's first comments were in relation to a road equivalent tariff. He will recollect, if he reads our election manifesto and the statements that I have made on this subject, that our commitment was to move towards a road equivalent tariff. We have always expressed it in those terms and that is the basis of our policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made reference to the fact that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I visited Norway in order to study the system that operates in that country as regards support for ferry services. I did so because it had often been argued that Norway was a perfect example of road equivalent tariffs in operation. I was very interested and rather surprised to find that no such system actually operated in Norway. It has a heavy system of subsidy for its ferry services, but it is not based in any way on a road equivalent tariff principle. It is simply a high level of subsidy, which has been applied pretty well across the board, without any obvious formula having been determined in its application. That was a matter of some interest and indeed surprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has rightly pointed out the delay which has occurred in announcing our conclusions as a result of the consultative document. We had hoped to make such an announcement earlier this year. The fact that we have not done so has been due to the varied representations that have been received as a result of that consultative document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As some hon. Gentlemen will know, Strathclyde regional council, Shetland Islands council and a number of other authorities, including the Western Isles council, have pointed out that a strict application of RET would be contrary to their interests and that they would not wish to support such a policy. That is at variance with the representations that have been received from many other authorities. It is therefore taking longer to come to a conclusion on this matter. However, we hope to be able to make an announcement before the House rises for the Summer Recess. We have not yet come to a conclusion on this matter, but it would be quite bogus to suggest that we have not already produced major advantages for the island communities, more dramatic than anything that has been seen over the past 25 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the record of the Labour Government, between 1975 and 1979 there was a fall in real terms in the level of support given to shipping services in the island communities. There was a slight cash increase from 	<i>£3i</i> million to just over £4 million, but in real terms that represented a reduction in the help given to island communities. The present Government, however, in two years—at a time of falling public expenditure—have increased the level of support to island communities from £4.3 million to £9.5 million for shipping services. It was a specific and important part of our election manifesto that we would do all within our power to ensure the viability of island communities. That is a promise that we have already kept—at a time of falling public expenditure—thereby indicating the enormous priority that we give to this particular area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister—he has been very good at giving way—but does the figure which he has just given include the £4 million which the Labour Government gave specifically to P and O to establish the link between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland? If the figure he is using is as accurate as he pretends, it cannot possibly include the £4 million that was given to P and O. The figure is much nearer to £9 million than to £4.3 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is wrong in his figures. It was not £4 million. I am advised that it was £0.4 million. We will certainly check
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
that, because it does make a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that the hon. Gentleman is referring to capital expenditure. The figures which I have been using, both for the Labour Government and for this Government, are revenue spending in terms of helping individual island communities. If we include capital, we have to include it under this Government as well, and the same comparison will be able to be made. My basic point is that there was a fall in real terms in the revenue support to island shipping services under the five years of a high-spending Labour Government, whereas, under a Conservative Government, who are reducing their expenditure on transport services generally, there has been a doubling of the amount of help given to island communities. That includes extra help not only to Calmac but to the Orkney Island Shipping Company and the new services for P and O to the northern islands, for the first time giving identifiable help to the island communities. There has also been help for bulk cargo supplies, such as the Shetland line and others. This is something in which we can take great pride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is not only the shipping services to the remoter island communities that we have been able to assist. Since this Government came into office the responsibility for helping small aerodromes in the more isolated parts of Scotland has been transferred from the Department of Trade to the Scottish Office. The help that we give to the Civil Aviation Authority to help keep these small aerodromes viable has been increased considerably from £1.7 million to £3.7 million. Were it not for the increased help which we have given to these very small aerodromes in the rural areas and in the island communities, the landing charges, instead of being £1.15, would have been over £13 per passenger. That indicates the dramatic difference. We make no apology for this, because, without such help, the viability of these small rural communities could not be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to the trunk and general roads in Scotland. Over the past two years there has been substantial improvement. We have had not only 15 extra miles of motorway opened, but 74 miles of new and improved trunk roads—a total investment of more than £120 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's trunk road priorities are as follows: first, the completion of the central Scotland motorway network; secondly, in line with our manifesto commitment, the dualling of the A94 from Perth all the way up to Aberdeen; thirdly, to continue with the reconstruction of the A74 in southern Strathclyde; and, fourthly, the bypasses on the Al east of Edinburgh at Musselburgh and Tranent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On each of these and, indeed, on a large number of smaller projects, substantial progress is being made. I would simply indicate at this stage the progress that has already been made in respect of our manifesto commitment on the dual carriageway up to Aberdeen. This is now being actively pursued with a programme of dualling schemes at a detailed planning stage. The final section of dual carriageway between Stonehaven and Aberdeen and a section of the Kingsway in Dundee were completed last year, and a scheme to the north of Dundee is just about finished. Two contracts to the north and south of Brechin have been let recently and a further five schemes will be started over
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the next few years in fulfilment of our manifesto commitment. These changes will make an enormous difference to the economy of the north-east, and their implementation is clearly justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These priorities, together with, for example, the improvements to deal with congestion on the A75 and similar schemes on other important roads, illustrate the Government's continuing commitment to this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bothwell)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that, so far as the A8 is concerned, going from Bellshill—I am talking about going to Edinburgh—and also from Bellshill to Glasgow, during the term of office of the Labour Government most of that road was brought up to motorway standard. When will the present Government continue the progress which is necessary to bring the rest of the A8 up to that standard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Successive Governments over the past 20 years have made enormous improvements to the whole motorway network in central Scotland, which is now virtually complete. The various improvements currently being planned were set out in the roads document issued last year. If the hon. Gentleman consults that and the other announcements that have been made, he will see the proposed timetable for further road improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts that I have given show that the hon. Gentleman's claim that transport and road services have somehow declined over the past few years is utter balderdash. We have shown in the most obvious way that we have not only been able to maintain the general transport services at a time of overall reductions in expenditure, but communities which most depend on their transport in the remoter areas and the island communities have received a level of help enormously greater than anything which was available to them under the Labour Government, who were committed to high spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that our priorities are correct. We believe that they accord with the realities of transport in Scotland. The transport policies which we have pursued over the past two years are policies of which we can be proud. They show that the rather pathetic attempts to condemn the Government's transport policy are based on prejudice, and not on facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the office boy is in his shirt sleeves. I rather welcome this appearance of vigour in the Scottish Office. I look forward to the Solicitor-General appearing in a rather fetching frilled chemise. But I doubt whether that would be possible in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no harm in giving the Government credit for providing a considerable amount of money for transport subsidies. I do not think that the Conservative vote will rise sharply in the islands at the next election. However, I am willing to give them credit for such good things as they have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Freight and travel charges remain the greatest handicap of the islands and all remote communities. In this connection, I want first to raise the question of the airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know this is not exclusively a Scottish Office responsibility, but it has taken a great interest in it and it is certainly appropriate to this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I particularly want to talk about Sumburgh, which is causing great anxiety, and about Wilsness, which is the terminal at Sumburgh devoted to oil-related traffic. The Secretary of State wrote me a long letter on this matter on 30 April, and in answer to a question on 6 May he said he was having discussions with the Civil Aviation Authority and the Secretary of State for Trade. I wonder whether the Minister could let us know how far those discussions have gone—if not now at any rate at some point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise three points about this matter immediately. There has been a demand for a public inquiry which would take time, so I have not particularly pressed for it, but there are three matters which need some investigation. The first is that the CAA apparently intends to write off 70 per cent, of the cost of Wilsness over five years. This seems to me to be a very short time and I think that that needs to be looked into and the time extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that the CAA has indicated to me that it would have been happy to have this built by either the airline companies or the oil companies but they were unwilling to do so. I have written to the CAA and have not yet got a reply so I cannot say with certainty at this stage, but Mr. Bristow said categorically that he had offered to build the terminal. If he had built it, it would have been a good deal cheaper, because one of the troubles is that everything that is done by public authorities is frightfully expensive, and also he would have provided a great incentive to the men there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the question whether the helicopter companies will go on using it. I think we have possibly been unnecessarily alarmed about this, but if the Government have any information I should be grateful for it . The Minister in his answer referred to private initiative. I believe the building of Wilsness, which could be done by private initiative, is suitable subject for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point I should like to mention is RET to which the Minister referred, I am not a tremendous advocate of RET. It seems to me to be unnecessarily complicated and it will react differently upon different island communities. For instance, I think Orkney will gain considerably from it and Shetland possibly will not. But if it is to be the chosen instrument, I am very glad that the Government are to make up their mind soon. This matter has been dragging on for a very long time and Orkney, at any rate, is extremely keen to get a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point about this, as I understand it, is that it will not benefit the outer islands. It will not benefit the north island of Orkney or the outer islands of Shetland. Clearly anything further that the Government can tell us about RET would be welcome, but what we really want is straightforward assistance over transport and freight, and the simpler this is, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection it has been suggested—I think by the Highlands and Islands Development Board—that one of the simplest ways of helping transport and bringing down costs in the north would be to relieve islands of the duty on petrol and oil, or some part of it. This would be perfectly simple. It would not lead to abuse. I suggest that the Government should look at this very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The other point about transport in the north on which I should like to touch is the railway north from Inverness. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) is here. He has raised this matter many times and asked for clarification. I do not want to tread on his toes. I am very careful not to tread on the toes of the SDP at the moment. Many of my constituents try to use that line and it really is beyond belief. It is not conceivable that journeys should take longer than at the end of the nineteenth century. It is full of old-world charm. I am told the engine driver has tea at one point on the way. I spent three-quarters of an hour in a station without even a progress report. When I raised the matter with somebody from the railway, he had not heard one either. He said it was all to do with the trains passing each other, but no trains passed. Bees flew in and out of the window, birds sang, but there was no sign of life on the railway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If nothing is to be done about this line, might it not be worth while seeing whether the local people or the people employed on the railway could take over the line and do something with it? It has great potential, not only as a means of ordinary travel and for freight and so on, but for tourists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are some points to which I should be grateful if the Government would give some attention. Once more, I emphasise there there is no more important matter in my constituency than freight and transport costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible to have a transport debate without recognising that on the mainland of Scotland the bulk of the goods and the majority of the people have to move by road and by rail. I accept that air and sea transport also have an important part to play and should not be ignored, and I hope in some future debate to speak on the air aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that today's debate will probably concentrate in the main on roads, because this is the area of related expenditure which falls within the Secretary of State's remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also intend to speak about roads, but, before doing so, I should like to place on record that I hope that the Government will soon place before the House proposals for the electrification of Scotland's main railway lines, and I hope that the proposals will be conditional upon the introduction of the most up-to-date manning practices to increase productivity and improve time keeping. Without these prerequisites it would be a great mistake for the Government to enter into an electrification programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to congratulate the Government on the Transport Act 1980. This Act has produced substantial benefits to travellers between London and Scotland, and this is particularly important for Scots who want to travel back to Scotland and for tourists. The new bus fares are a great help, and my own children have made use of the very good bus service between Perth and London. This has helped to bring them down at times when they are on holiday and I am not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the pressures on public spending and the need to obtain the best possible use of resources calls for an enlightened and imaginative roads policy. In particular, I believe this calls for new ideas both in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
way we plan and construct roads and in the way that roads are used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trunk roads through my constituency have two most important demands placed upon them. The first is that the North Sea oil-related and other industrial traffic requires to move easily and efficiently and with the maximum safety. The second demand is that tourist traffic requires that there is effective signposting and a sufficiency of stopping places and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to meet these demands and to ensure the best possible use of the roads, the Scottish Development Department requires to have a policy which is constructive, imaginative and sensible. So I ask the question: what is the policy of the Scottish Development Department? Does the Scottish Development Department have a policy for the Scottish roads, and in particular does it have a policy for the signposting of Scottish roads? I repeat: does it have a policy for the signposting of Scottish roads? If it does, will my hon. Friend tell us what the policy is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the SDD seems to have different policies for different roads. Can my hon. Friend confirm that the policy for signs on the A74 is the same as the policy for signs on the A9? Is its policy for signposting towns and villages which have been bypassed the same as for all main trunk routes? If so, why is there a difference between the A74 and the A9? Is its policy for the provision of roadside services and facilities the same on both routes? If so, why have the imaginative schemes proposed for such services and facilities just outside Perth been given the cold shoulder? It seems that there are different policies for different routes. I declare a constituency interest here. I should like to see something done about the A9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to draw attention to the problems facing the tourist traffic, particularly traffic from Edinburgh travelling north on the route over the Friarton bridge. This is another example where SDD thinking leaves someting to be desired, because I still believe that this motorway on stilts, as it has been called, is a dangerous piece of motorway. I am certain that one day there will be a very serious accident. I wish it were not so. For the traffic travelling over the Friarton bridge towards Dundee and then north to Aberdeen via Forfar, the route is adequately signposted. But anyone travelling north would think it was the only route and that there were no alternative routes to Aberdeen—that indeed one could not go via Forfar, going through Perth and Coupar Angus, because there is no way of indicating this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many places of historic and scenic beauty are in danger of being bypassed and missed—for example, Glamis Castle, glorious Glenshee, superb Strathhar-dle, bonnie Blairgowrie, Meigle, Coupar Angus, Glen Prosen and the Loch of Lows, to mention but a few. All of these places are dependent on the tourist industry and trade for their survival; yet they cannot be located in any way from this main route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were traveling through the city of Perth, reading the signposts one would be routed via Dundee to Forfar and the north, if one was thinking of going to Aberdeen. Yet, from the tourist's point of view, it is much better to travel via Coupar Angus, Neigle and Glamis Castle. On the way one would pass Scone Palace. We require some serious rethinking of how to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
encourage tourists to travel by what I would look on as tourist routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that there are difficulties in determining what is a tourist route, but this should not prevent us from looking at this very seriously and being encouraged to follow the example of other countries in the way they have signposted their tourist routes. I speak as someone who has travelled many hundreds of thousands of miles as a tourist, both in North America and in Europe. I have no doubt that we have a lot to learn from the signpostings carried out over there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to make the best possible use of our existing roads and the maximum use of the £92,669,000 which we propose to spend in the next year and of the £24,500,000 for maintenance, we must have policies which produce the combination of the free and easy flow of heavy industrial traffic, yet allow for the tourist traffic to find the routes that are most suited to tourism and will help the development of the tourist area in key parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is time my hon. Friend told the "hard-nosed men" at the SDD the facts of life relative to today. It is important. We want a policy that is in keeping with the economic circumstances of today and the economic needs of the country. Certainly, if tourism is one of the major industries in Scotland, signposting should have top priority. The customer should be directed towards areas that are in need of the funds that they would wish to spend. I would hope something could be done about it. We want a policy on roads and on signposting which is the same as on the A74 and the A9 and other trunk routes. We do not want different policies. In my part of Scotland we want a policy that will help the tourist trade, not destroy it. I am calling for the SDD to get out of the age of the T-model Ford and into the age of the Mini Metro. I am calling for a policy of signposting to meet the needs of the tourist and the tourist industry, to offer the tourist the option of travelling north, say, from Forfar via Glamis, Neigle, Coupar Angus and Scone Palace with adequate signposting along the route for Glenshee and other places of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present method of signposting makes this almost impossible, and this is true of so many other routes. On behalf of my constituents in the tourist industry, and all others engaged in Scotland in the tourist industry, I ask my hon. Friend—I consider him to be one of the best Ministers in the Scottish Office—to use his active, imaginative mind to made sure that the hard-nosed men in the Scottish Development Department are made to change their ways. I hope that will be the message that he will take today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) will not expect me to follow him in his guided tour of his constituency. I am astonished to hear him say that the main problem concerning transport in Scotland—in his constituency or anywhere else—is a signposting policy. However, having heard the plaudit he has just given to the Minister, we can expect the Minister to give him a biscuit or, perhaps, appoint him as a PPS some time in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) about the need for further investment in electrification and in the railway network. I appreciate that this is not entirely the responsibility of the Minister here, but I hope that he will use what influence he may have with the Secretary of State for Transport to protect the east coast main line between Newcastle and Edinburgh, which is supposed to be under an explicit threat because it is not in the 15-year electrification programme. Also, in view of the proximity of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), he might like to bear in mind the North Berwick branch line, which seems to be under constant threat from economy seekers of all Administrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to concentrate my remarks this morning on road transport. I want to talk about the roads, fuel and buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fairly acutely aware of the problems of the roads in my own constituency since I have to travel at least 800 miles every month on those roads in the course of my work. I am aware that there has been a slowdown in the processing of improvement schemes on roads such as the Al. I am also aware of the severe clampdown since this Government came to power on the improvement and repair work of roads which are under the control of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help being a little worried about one point which came out in last year's Borders region transport policies and programme. It included one graphic example of the techniques of make do and mend, to which my hon. Friend referred, which are being forced on local authorities as a result of the parsimony of this Administration. Disintegrating masonry bridges on roads in the Borders are being kept together by driving wooden wedges between the stones underneath the arches. These are the kind of antics in which local authorities are being compelled to indulge rather than to carry out proper repairs to bridges. In view of that factor, perhaps hon. Members might care to think about their safety and to say their prayers before driving very far within the Borders region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian region is experiencing similarly unrealistic allocations of money which are being aggravated further by the Secretary of State's petty-minded insistence on personally vetting capital spending in Lothian region under the section 94 procedure. This, I would contend, is an example of pure political spite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to refer to one paragraph in the current Lothian region transport policies programme. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Regional Council hopes the Secretary of State will operate the procedure for the approval of Lothian's capital scheme efficiently and timeously in order to avoid the unnecessary delays in starting schemes that occured in 1980/81".</p></blockquote>
Some hope, Mr. Henderson. There has been ample evidence that the Scottish Office intends to continue to be as spiteful as it has been in the past year as far as Lothian region is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Minister to reply to a specific point concerning the Tranent-Musselburgh bypass. He has already referred to it during his speech. He knows that last week the National Coal Board decided not to go ahead with extracting coal from the opencast site in that area. This decision has implications for the new stretch of the A1 road on the Tranent-Musselburgh bypass. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) and I would appreciate an assurance
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
that there will be no further slippage in the time scale for this urgently needed new stretch of road on the Al. The Minister must accept severe criticism for his short-sighted policy of deferring road construction and maintenance. I hope that he will think again about this whole question, not least because of the jobs which could be created by a more vigorous road construction scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of road fuel. I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is not leaving, because I am about to refer to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not leaving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a question for the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of causing any offence to the hon. Member.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Henderson. As the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of these exchanges, I think I had better pay more attention to the sensitivities of the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having referred to the two hon. Members who voted against that tax increase, I might also make mention of the six further rural Scottish Conservatives who paraded their consciences by abstaining on the Budget Resolutions, but who then voted for the tax increase in the Finance Bill Committee. I hope that their constituents will pay careful attention to the fact that they did not represent their constituencies as well as the hon. Members to whom I have already referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have provided us with the biggest ever price increase in road fuel over a two-year period in the whole history of road fuel—99.3 per cent. That was before the price increases which were announced by the petrol companies last week. These developments, together with increasing pressure on small rural retailers from the oil companies, are creating terrible difficulties for those who have to rely on their cars for almost anything in rural Scotland. It is unlikely that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
people in rural Scotland will forget the cynical attitude which has been displayed in recent weeks by their Conservative Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with some remarks about buses, and I make no apology for concentrating on the problems of my own constituency. First, I should like the Minister to explain why he has decided to prevent Lothian region council from reducing bus fares by 20 per cent, in my own constituency in order to bring them into line with the bus fares in his own constituency in Edinburgh. He has refused to allow the Eastern Scottish Bus Company—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Myles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the rural areas and the cost to the rural areas. He said he travelled something like 800 miles a month in his constituency. I expect that he will claim for that as expenses. I expect also that he does a certain number of miles in his constituency on his farming activities, and I should expect that he would possibly claim some VAT back on that. So in the rural areas there are compensations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting point, but I think it is irrelevant. Most people in rural areas have to run cars in order to get to their working places, and they cannot reclaim their VAT. Farmers, such as the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Myles) and myself, might be able to indulge in these schemes, but I do not think we should get into a discussion about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted, I was referring to the bus subsidy in Lothian region. The Minister has refused to allow the Eastern Scottish Bus Company to accept an increase grant from Lothian region in order to bring about an equalisation in the fare scales between Edinburgh and the rest of the Lothian region. He is now forcing the Eastern Scottish to put up its prices by 10 per cent, to make this discrepancy even worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from the fact that this means that the ratepayers in East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian will continue to subsidise Edinburgh's buses, it is well known that the high fares policy being advocated by the Government is actually counter-productive, because it deters passengers and makes services even more unprofitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we need any proof of that, we need look no further than the Borders region, to which I have already referred. In the Borders, bus fares are already fully 35 per cent, above the Scottish average, which means that potential passengers are either staying at home or running their cars. The bus service in the Borders are in a state of collapse. That fact is confirmed by the Scotmap survey which has recently been published. The survey does not cover the question of passenger resistance to high fares, but it does go into enormous detail to prove the obvious fact that bus services in towns are less uneconomic than those in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to this revelation and also to further finance cuts from the Scottish Office, the Borders regional council set in motion major cuts in the bus network in that region. Twenty-two of the region's 98 buses are to go, along with 20 drivers, and there has been a further fare rise of 7.5 per cent. This sort of surgery on a network which is already patchy is bound to lead to vast areas having no services whatsoever. A number of people have written to me about these
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
proposals, including a gentleman in the village of Leitholm in Berwickshire who pointed out that the only bus service connecting his village to the shopping centres of Berwick or Kelso would arrive after the return bus had left. Mr. Macdonald of Leitholm wrote as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How bloody silly, Mr. Robertson, can the Regional Council get? Must elderly pensioners spend the night in a Kelso or Berwick hotel? How does one get to Edinburgh or Newcastle?"</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is it too much to ask that you urge Mr. George Younger to get up off his backside and intervene in this idiocy?"</p></blockquote>
He is overlooking the fact that the Secretary of State for Scotland has already intervened in order to cause this idiocy by cutting the finances available to public transport. To be fair to the Regional Council, I should day that it is endeavouring to juggle what is left of its resources to keep the skeleton service intact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote briefly from a letter I received from Mr. Paul Gregory of the Borders Regional Council planning department. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The financial target imposed on the Scottish Bus Group to make a 5 per cent, return upon capital is regarded .by this Council as unreasonable and unjust since the only source of such funds to the Bus Group is the Regional Council's revenue support. Further, to impose this requirement at a time when Local Government is under pressure as never before to cut its expenditure seems exceptionally ill considered."</p></blockquote>
That does come not from Lothian regional council, but from the Minister's friend on the Borders Regional Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I want to stress that I am not necessarily calling for an open-ended commitment to regular bus services all over the place in remote rural areas. I recognise the fact that in many sparsely populated areas non-conventional forms of transport might be much more suitable. I am thinking of post buses, the Border courier service or even car-sharing. Schemes like these are being tried and need further encouragement, but I contend that it is little short of criminal for any Government to cut the throats of small villages by destroying their existing bus services before these alternative schemes are ready to take their place. Equally, I contend that it is stupid for the Government to endanger potentially successful bus services by pricing them out of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope that we shall have a more constructive reply from the Minister at the end of the debate than we had at the beginning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Steward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because transport is so fundamental to trade and industry, we need not look very much further than the deplorable transport system in Scotland for one of the reasons for the country's industrial decline and the poor shape that our base is in—in fact, almost close to collapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many indications to prove that: the motorway up to the border at Carlisle; beyond that a substandard dual carriageway all the way to Glasgow; and the notorious A74. On the A94 south of Stonehaven there is a single-track Bailey bridge with traffic lights which delays traffic on the main road to and from Europe's oil capital. There are half-completed and, in some cases, ill-advised urban motorways in Glasgow. There is a ferry system on the western sea

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
board that seems destined to make living there as difficult and expensive as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be churlish, and before I finish I want to come back to the contribution that the Government have made. Railway lines and rolling stock have been out of date for a quarter of a century or more. I know that there are run-down, clapped-out carriages in other parts of Scotland, but it seems to me that, as one gets further north, the conditions of the stock gets worse and worse, as if there were some kind of elephants' graveyard in the Highlands where all the dying carriages go. The state of the track generaly, because of lack of funds to the railways, is deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A colleague was telling me in the Transport Office the other day that now, after a period when the time for journeys from London to the north had been shrinking considerably, the time is now becoming longer because of the need to slow down the trains when running over a considerable portion of the track.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are seaports that have not had the capital investment needed to enable them to compete for business drawn to the south where capital investment and modernisation have had top priority. It makes a sorry catalogue of neglect and indifference on the part of successive Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Added to this sorry picture is the present Government's mishandling of transport policy, their attitude towards fuel costs and their policy of demanding a commercial rate of return on capital employed by publicly-owned organisations. The tax on transport fuels has had a more serious effect in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom. It adversely affects the manufacturing and distribution costs and, even more adversely, the living standards of rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would support the plea made by the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) that the Government should give serious consideration to the suggestion by the Highlands and Islands Development Board that these taxes be removed in the Islands. It would certainly be one way to ensure that developments could take place and that the people could have a reasonable cost of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been deprived of rail and local public transport services, people are relying more and more on private transport, only to find that this is now getting beyond their reach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of railways, I should like the Minister to give some assurance that the Scottish Office will use its influence to see that there will be no question of closing the west coast line to Mallaig or the line from Inverness to the Kyle of Lochalsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On electrification, it is surprising that the Under-Secretary is unaware of what was reported in the papers this morning. The Secretary of State must have been sleeping if he has not informed his colleagues about the injection of £750 million, according to the press, that is going into the electrification of railways. Scotland, with Romania, is at the bottom of the league—only 12 per cent, as against, for instance, 58 per cent, of electrified line in Norway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that if electrification is on the cards—if that is confirmed—the Scottish Office should stake its claim for a substantial part of that to come to Scotland. I remember that hundreds of miles of line were elec-
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
trified in England, but not one mile in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the Linwood factories might be used to build the carriages that would be required for electrified lines. But there must be no further rail closures. That has proved to be an absolutely disastrous policy. The policy carried out by Lord Beeching a number of years ago will be seen in retrospect to be the most disastrous ever to be carried out in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of ferries, the Minister spoke about the policy of the Government to move towards the road equivalent tariff. That is a handy phrase. It is like waiting to get to the end of the rainbow, and it could be used just as effectively 10 years hence. As other speakers have said, I am not unduly concerned whether it is a road equivalent tariff. It can be any form of subsidy—the substantial form that the Minister saw in Norway. The question is how to assist the transport systems of the west coast. I accept his claim that the Government have given substantial support to the communities on the western seaboard by the increased subsidy to Caledonian MacBrayne and by the subsidies to the bulk carriers. That will inevitably make a very useful contribution to the communities in the Scottish Islands, and I pay tribute to the Government for having done that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the seaports, there was an article in The Scotsman on 19 March stating how Scottish ports are being sold down the river. I accept that this is not the fault of Government. When exporters have brought in their goods to be shipped FOB British ports, obviously the buyer can state the ports from which he wishes these goods to leave. The Scottish Office should look at what is in store for the Clyde and Forth ports. If this policy continues, it will be extremely serious for those ports. The Scottish Office should keep a watching brief on it.

A motorway which ends at Carlisle seems clearly to indicate that it is regarded by Westminster Governments as the furthest outpost of civilisation. The Scottish National Party will continue to press for improvements in Scottish transport, but it seems that the problems which have been outstanding for so long will be tackled only with the advent of a Scottish Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to a mere £14 million. I believe that railway investment has to be a very high priority. I appreciate that when I talk about railway investment I am referring to that aspect over which the Scottish Office has some influence. I am very interested also in the reports which appear in today's newspapers con

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
cerning the Government's decision in principle to inject capital into our railway system because what has been said about clapped-out rolling stock is absolutely true. If the Cabinet decides to go ahead, then I believe that that would be a sound investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year I received a letter from the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association, a copy of which I believe went to all hon. Members. The association spelled out in that letter the importance of achieving railway electrification. It said that it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a sound investment providing an internal real rate of return of about 11 per cent. The largest and fastest option, extending over 20 years, gives the greatest benefits. It would cost in cash flow terms an average of £32 million a year for the first 15 years. But it would take about a year from the date of decision to incur any significant expenditure and three or four years to build up a steady rate of work."</p></blockquote>
I have made a number of inquiries about this following the receipt of that letter, and I believe that to be true in every respect. It would also, of course, provide much needed employment and would save about 120 million gallons of oil a year over the United Kingdom as a whole if an electrification policy were followed through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of employment some of my hon. Friends and I recently had a meeting with the National Union of Mineworkers. Mr. McGahey, the president of the Scottish area of the NUM, was anxious to point out how important electrification was to his industry, because it would provide a much needed boost to the steel industry which, in turn, would benefit the Scottish coalfield. I was impressed by that argument. The arguments for electrification as a means of giving a new impetus to the Scottish economy cannot be overstated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have a constituency interest in electrification. For many years there has been a sustained campaign by the community in Cumbernauld to achieve the electrification of the Glasgow railway. Recently the district council convened a meeting at which the British Rail and the Cumbernauld Development Corporation were represented. So was the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive and the Cumbernauld Commuters' Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail explained that the Government had come up with the cash and that there was no other way of achieving electrification. The source of money had to be the Government. British made it clear that it was anxious to achieve electrification of the commuter area in the north of Glasgow. It envisaged electrification as far as Dunblane, which is as far as the commuter catchment area for Glasgow extends. It recognised the financial constraints facing the Strath-clyde region, but it was working with the Strathclyde region in an effort to produce arguments which it would advance to the Government. The Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive is, however, pessimistic about elecrtification and about getting cash from the Government. It said that the electrification of the Cumbernauld line might be achieved through GEAR with the line going via Parkhead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representative of the GGPTE was identifying an option, but he said that, despite all representations, heavy lobbying by the campaigners, the fact that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
have written more letters on this issue than on any other so far as Cumbernauld is concerned, and local authority pressure, there had been no real change in the position since 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rail unions in Scotland are concerned about the policy being pursued by the Government. They said that if 80 per cent. of the funding available for transport were to go to roads and 20 per cent, to the rest, or 70 per cent, to the roads and 30 per cent, to the rail, bus and ferry services, electrification in Scotland would be seriously in jeopardy. Those comments were made by Mr. John Walker, of ASLEF, who is a trade union officer who enjoys a good reputation in Scotland for being thoroughly well informed on all aspects of transport policy. I give great weight to what he says. I know that he and his trade union colleagues are likewise putting as much pressure as they can on the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development corporation in Cumbernauld is anxious to see electrification because of its immense importance to the business of attracting industry. It must be shown in a new town, where the future is entirely dependent on the infrastructure and the capacity to attract and hold industry, that the railway plays a very important part. Only recently we have had serious problems and have been told of further redundancies at Burroughs. Everything that can be done to maintain the attractiveness of the town as a location for industry and a place to live is very important to me and to the district council and the development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Scottish Office will use its influence with the Government and that the Secretary of State for Scotland will fight for the largest possible share of the capital investment which is to be made in rail electrification, if we are to believe the reports that are coming out of yesterday's Cabinet meeting. I hope he will ensure that there is positive discrimination in favour of the need for electrification in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) referred to petrol in rural areas. I regret that he is not in his place at present, but it was with specific reference to Conservative Members of Parliament in Scotland. I apologise to him for raising it in his absence, but it is not my fault that he is not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of petrol has become acute in rural areas. I and a number of my colleagues attempted to make a detailed investigation of the way petrol prices appeared to discriminate against the rural dweller and we prepared a report. I regret that the hon. Member did not see fit to make any submission to us or, alternatively, as he had been very generously invited to do, join us in the representations we made to the Office of Fair Trading and to the major oil companies. It is not without significance that, in the most recent petrol crisis, the major oil companies have made it clear that they are removing the discounts that operate in favour of urban dwellers and are not seeking to distribute their increased costs across the board in both urban and rural areas. One can say with some conviction that that was in part due to the impact of what we had to say. That certainly comes out from the reaction we have had from the oil companies. Finally, what we had to do was of significant and interest in the hon. Gentle

man's constituency, because we received a large number of representations from petrol retailers in the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific matter I should like to raise with the Minister relates to the manifesto commitment that we had before the general election to dual the road from Perth to Aberdeen. It is important to emphasise that that commitment was stated clearly and unequivocally in the manifesto. But, for at least two years prior to that, the Conservative Opposition made it clear that they considered the dualling of that road was a necessary part of the infrastructure of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider it regrettable that my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the Scottish Office who took office after May 1979, had to start at that point the design and surveying work and the financing of it. Although for at least two years the Conservative Opposition had identified that need, no preliminary work had been undertaken in advance. I welcomed that manifesto commitment. I think it was generally welcomed not only in the north-east of Scotland, and in my constituency through which the road passes, but throughout Scotland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that my hon. Friend gave me in a written answer yesterday show that expenditure on trunk roads in Tayside region in the last three years has totalled £76.4 million and that about £22 million is expected to be spent in the current year, 1981/82. I also understand that there will be increased expenditure in 1982/83. That expenditure—particularly as the Government that have made it quite clear that they believe that public expenditure ought to be controlled—is a very significant advance in Scotland and something that, not surprisingly, Opposition Ministers seek as best they can to gloss over an improvement in our road structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much aware that at the present time the design work on this road, the surveying and, indeed, the land acquisition procedures are well advanced. On a number of occasions I have had to write to my hon. Friend about this work. I would like to report that the tenor of the replies that I have received from him indicates that there is no obstruction within his Department. To that extent it departs from the hard-nosed image that has been conferred upon it by one of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, something of a change of emphasis that I should like to urge upon the Minister. The completion of the Friarton bridge means that people can come over that bridge, take the dual carriageway to Dundee, go round the improved Kingsway and then proceed northwards. Up to that point, if they were to travel from London, they would travel on dual carriageways all the way, except for about a mile and a half on the fringes of Edinburgh. But as soon as one reaches that point one immediately comes to a very much reduced standard of road and, as the traffic flow has increased, when the traffic comes off the dual carriageway there is undoubtedly a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that such bottlenecks must occur as the road develops. I recognise also, as the Minister indicated in his opening remarks, that contracts have already been let for stretches of this dualling, partly in my constituency and also in that of my right hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). That is warmly welcome. I hope that the work can proceed as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
What does concern me—and it is relevant in the context of the Armitage report that we were considering in the House yesterday—is that the greatest priority for the development of roads should be on bypasses. Although the need for a bypass for Forfar is widely recognised—and I accept that the Labour Government had laid careful plans for that bypass, albeit with a single rather than a dual carriageway—it appears that regrettably there has been something of a slippage in the building of this bypass because of a design planning problem. The residents of Forfar find that, because of increased traffic, parts of the town are becoming intolerably congested, and this represents the major slowing up of any journey north to Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background that I would ask the Minister to give us some indication today as to when it is anticipated that the work on that bypass will be commenced and how long the construction will take to complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidental to that, can I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). As the road direct from Perth to Forfar has ceased to be of major importance as a trunk route, problems are beginning to emerge with regard to the established tourist attractions along that route. I have already written to the Minister urging that some provision should be made to give an indication to tourists travelling north that that is an attractive route to take. Indeed, because it is a tourist route, they can look forward to experiencing traffic levels that will not be objectionable or unattractive to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire referred to the A9, and it is a good parallel to draw. I would like to see a similar device deployed on that short bit of road that connects up round to the north of Dunkelm, which is an extremely attractive bit of road now that there is no heavy traffic on it. When it was a heavy traffic route, it was a terrible stretch of road. But now that the heavy lorries never use that road, it is extremely attractive for tourists. I hope that the opportunities that such signposting gives for the use of those roads by tourists will be used in that part of Strathmore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have always had the feeling that large parts of the transport debate are really not strictly party political, although obviously, as we have heard this morning, the major decisions undoubtedly are. When we have a doctrinaire Secretary of State for Transport who, whether the Scottish Office likes it or not, largely decides the type and scope of the programme in Scotland, there are undoubtedly very strong political divisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made to the selling off of British Rail hotels. The way it is being done is quite disgraceful. This matter will probably need to be looked at much more carefully, much more deeply, when the opportunity arises. The Minister referred to the Transport Act 1980. Many of the provisions in the Act were hailed as great saviours of transport, particularly rural transport. I think that we should wait for a wee while to see how they actually work out. Car
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
sharing has already been quite a disappointment. It is not likely to be anything like as glamorous as was hoped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of rural transport, the Minister spoke in terms of the marvellous reduction in fares between London and Glasgow. The whole of our rural system was largely subsidised or cross-subsidised by the old bus companies and by the nationalised companies. I do not believe there is any other way of running rural transport. There has to be some sort of cross-subsidisation or direct subsidisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) made some complaints. He wanted better transport in Argyll, with which I agree. But he should have given some credit to Strathclyde region for the improvement in transport since Argyll became part of Strathclyde. Parts of Argyll that I know that had no buses, or one bus on a Tuesday plus the school bus. They now have a reasonable bus service all the year round. Some credit should have been given there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short time that I have I want to make one or two points. They may seem unconnected, but I believe that they have a genuine philosophy behind them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what are the Minister's views on bridge tolls? I must have written hundreds of letters explaining to people that we could not take tolls off bridges because, if they are estuarial crossings, there will be savings on petrol and wear and tear on the car and it is only fair to ask people to pay for that and for the saving of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not because I am in Opposition now that I have changed my mind. I have changed my mind for other reasons. I always supported the idea of tolls. When a local authority wanted a big estuarial crossing bridge, it would give figures showing that the bridge would easily pay for itself. The argument was that if it were given borrowing powers, it would be able to pay it back. Usually, the Government did not believe it, but ultimately local pressure became so strong that the Forth, Erskine and Tay bridges were built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for the Erskine bridge are rather pathetic. The total surplus in 1970 was £145,000, but that still left a deficiency, when debt charges were paid, of £2.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I now feel that we should consider getting rid of the tolls is that there are no other big estuarial bridges to come. Therefore, we are not giving any hostages to fortune if we now decide to allow bridge tolls to go. The important thing is that it would open up certain areas of the country that much better—perhaps not from the original intention of the major tourist or freight routes, but socially. I am thinking particularly of the Erskine bridge. Knowing people in the area, I am sure that there must be a bit of a penalty on them in social intercourse if they have to pay to cross the bridge. It is a psychological barrier as well. For all we get from the bridges, I think it would be no bad thing to get rid of the tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard a great discussion about Caledonian MacBrayne. I wonder how much Caledonian Mac-Brayne is a necessary whipping boy for the islands. It is something that everyone wants to use. Every now and again there have been letters in the press from Caledonian MacBrayne. I remember an occasion when someone in the constituency of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) wrote saying that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
cost of apples in the Western Isles was something like 10p a lb. more because of transport, and that the Caledonian MacBrayne freight manager sent a note of the last consignment of apples to the Western Isles and it worked out at about lp a lb. I often wonder how much truth there is in this idea that Caledonian MacBrayne bleeds everyone. I wonder whether it is almost necessary for the island people to have the seivice and, if they did not have it, to invent something like it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point I should like to make, which may sound slightly science fiction or far-fetched, concerns the use of solar and wind energy for electric vehicles on the islands. I have always believed that Scotland was an entity. The Labour Government occasionally—not as much as I would have liked—used Scotland as an experimental ground. For instance, Scotland led the way with the Social Work (Scotland) Act. Scotland has been able to lead the way on many things because, as an entity, it was much more comprehensible to people than perhaps the rest of the United Kingdom, which has about nine times the population of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we could use the islands for the testing of electrical vehicles. I suggest that is not science fiction. Germany and Japan are now spending millions of pounds on electric vehicle experiments. In another 10 years, unless we do something fairly big now, we shall finish up at the end of the queue, because our innovators and risk takers were not as willing as perhaps they should have been. I know that the Highlands and Islands Development Board is interested, but evaluation trials are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde university in Glasgow, has done a fair amount of work in this sphere. Dr. J. Twidell, in one of his papers, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is but one strategy to lessen the problems of transport to rural and island areas—the strategy of local self-sufficiency for goods and of modern telecomunications for information. The former must certainly include food, and the latter can today include two-way video and facsimile telecommunication."</p></blockquote>
What is suggested is that we are almost on the brink world-wide of being able to move over to multi-energy types of vehicle. In the Highlands and Islands and rural areas it would be possible to have electric vehicles run on a test basis. I hope that the Minister will at least consider these things sympathetically. Japan and Germany are said to be spending millions on trying to do this, and they will steal it away from us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to speak about some information that we received yesterday from Strathclyde on the Glasgow road system. I hope that the Minister will look at this with great care. I have a great many complaints about the Glasgow road system and the way it has operated so far. I hope that the Scottish Office will ask the local authority to think again before it goes into some more grandiose schemes on the Glasgow system. For instance, I do not think we have done nearly enough on traffic management, bus lanes, parking control and many other things that could be done before we go on to a gigantic road scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we have probably one of the best road systems, but we also have the lowest car ownership of any comparable city in Britain. That seems to me to be a contradiction. The Secretary of State held up the Great Western road scheme in Glasgow. That was a blessing, because now we realise that we do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
really need the Great Western road scheme, although many hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on preparing the way for this road by building the pavements further back from the existing road in order that the entire road could be made a three-lane dual carriageway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not party political points, but the Scottish Office and the Minister at the end of the day have a certain amount of control over how money should be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that we have not a great deal longer for this debate. I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply to the points that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Martin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow Springburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the time, but I should just like briefly to mention the fact that on 27 June the railway workshops in Springburn will celebrate their 125th anniversary by having an open day for the public. Unfortunately, it will not be a very happy day for the people of the area because they have word that there will be redundancies in the railway engineering workshops. The apprentices have been told by the management that there is no guarantee of a job for many of them once their apprenticeships are completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the type of situation we have in a workshop which employs approximately 2,500 men. They are all highly skilled people. They are welders, coach builders, engineers, electricians, plumbers. Every type of skilled person is working there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support all the hon. Members who say that the electrification of the railway system is a "must", because that would certainly give a boost to the engineering workshops. The Scottish Office could help to give a boost to the people there by asking the Government to put more investment into the advanced passenger train. We can see from the difficulties we are having with air travel at the moment that a train which can travel between Glasgow and London within four hours is a "must", and it would be of benefit to the economy and people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only criticism I have of Strathclyde and the Scottish Office is this. Glasgow has a more than adequate supply of motorways and expressways, yet the officials in Strathclyde are hell bent on building more link roads and bypasses. In my constituency an area called Harcourt Drive is to be demolished because the officials want to put a link road on to the existing Glasgow to Greenock road. A bypass is to built to bypass Stepps. It will be very convenient for the people of Stepps, but it means that the people of Glasgow will suffer more and more disruption, and communities will be torn apart. These are areas that the Scottish Office can look at. It is a tragedy that some of the land which was acquired by a private speculator under the Robroyston land deal will have to be purchased back to build the Stepps bypass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to do something. He may say that he does not have a great deal of control over investment in railways, but he certainly has a great deal of control in that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
I believe that in the past 12 years transport has been debated only twice in this Committee. Perhaps this is an indication of the low level of priority accorded to transport by successive Governments, and I include the Labour Party in that remark. But it is a sad fact, and possibly one of the reasons why we have such great problems facing transport services today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The polices of the Government are giving public transport a battering. Railways and bus services are being starved of the money they need to run a proper service. At the same time, the Government are selling off valuable public assets and are opening the gates to private bus and coach operators to exploit profitable routes at the expense of the network of public services. Meanwhile, fares go up and services deteriorate, leading to a further drop in passengers, leading to more fare increases and further cuts in services, and so on. It is a vicious and apparently never-ending circle, but it must end. We must regard transport as an essential social service and not on a profit motive basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me declare an interest in transport as a former worker in the Glasgow corporation transport department and also as a sponsored member of the Transport and General Workers Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, too, that it would be appropriate to place on record the fact that the country does get a good service from the workers in transport. This is not always appreciated by the generalpublic. Anti-social hours, the need to work overtime to maintain reasonable earnings, continual stress, liability to abuse and assaults make this not the most attractive of employment. When fares rise and services are cut, it is the transport workers who are at the receiving end, not the politicians or officials who make the decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nation's highways are deteriorating at an accelerating rate and funds are not being made available to meet current needs or future requirements. This is leading to unemployment in the private sector as well as to loss of job opportunity in the public sector. It is very expensive in terms of damage to vehicles and resultant claims against local authorites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need, as a matter of necessity, substantial public investment in the maintenance of our roads, and these Estimates do not provide anything like enough money for this purpose. In real terms there is a cut in the money available for salting, gritting and snow-clearing. Are the Government banking on a mild winter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish to achieve value for money in local government and in regard to public transport to minimise the overall level of financial support. In fact, with the Transport Act 1980, the Government are working against their own aims by encouraging private operators to cream off the profitable routes which presently help to cross-subsidise uneconomic but socially desirable services. This will lead to further public service subsidy being necessary or to services being withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bus industry in particular will suffer badly in the phasing-out of the new bus grant. This paid for 50 per cent, of the cost of new buses. It has been cut to 30 per cent, and will disappear completely by 1984. At this rate, by 1984 public spending on our bus system will be at nearly half the level it was 10 years earlier. With new buses costing about £60,000, who will find the missing money? Will this be passed on to the fare-paying passengers leading to a further passenger reduction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The bus industry has made considerable improvements in productivity over the past 15 years —conversion to one-man operation, higher capacity vehicles, where needed, cuts in services and frequencies, the loss of many thousands of jobs, mainly through natural wastage—yet all this has benefited neither the consumer nor the employees in the industry. There are in a worse situation than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail is starved of cash for track maintenance, structural renewal, development of signalling systems and rolling stock. It is in danger of having to introduce further speed reductions and even line closures, unless it can obtain more money. Investment is less than half that of most European railway systems. Those systems also have a far higher percentage of electrified line.

The passenger volume, which increased from 1974 to 1979, had now begun to turn down, and it is doubtful whether we shall see an increase in fares, further decrease in passengers and a vicious spiral of further rundown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gar-scadden (Mr. Dewar) outlined the need for main line electrification; this is an absolute essential. In energy terms, the case for electrification is unanswerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Cath-cart (Mr. Maxton) and Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) rightly touched upon the problems of high costs of public transport facing workers travelling to work. It is even worse for the unemployed. They are often trapped in perimeter schemes, unable to meet the fares and therefore not able to travel anywhere. This has a knock-on effect of service reductions and higher costs leading to increased fares. We are back to square one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire East, (Mr. Hogg) made a very useful contribution to the debate about the problems of commuters in the Greater Glasgow area. I know he has worked extremely hard in an attempt to achieve the electrification of the Cumbernauld-Glasgow line, and it is time the Government gave a favourable response by releasing the funds for this scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have referred to Lothian Regional transport. A recent survey by Transport 2000 found as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The best bus service is to be found in Edinburgh, where the transport policies are laid down by the Labour-controlled Lothian Regional Council. Edinburgh's buses are the cheapest and most frequent.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The average fare in Edinburgh is only 5p, cheaper even than South Yorkshire".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Four Labour councils top the survey, which awards points to councils on the basis of how cheap the buses are, how frequent they are … Top of the list is Edinburgh … Joint second are South Yorkshire and Hull … fourth is Nottingham … The all-round-worst bus service belongs to Tory-controlled Southend. Southend has fewer roads with bus routes than any other town in the sample, comes fifth from the bottom in terms of frequency and has the second highest fares."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether Southend's bad public transport services are a direct result of the by-election last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like to quote from the 1977 debate in this Committee, by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Younger)—in his absence I can do no better than quote his own remarks—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sorry that the Secretary of State has not been able to hear any of the debate in person. He is probably busy, and he cannot possibly attend all the debates . . We hope that in future he will regard it as a high priority to contribute to the Estimates debates, although we quite appreciate that he cannot be expected to speak at all of them.—	<i>[Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 26 July 1977, cc. 48-49.]</p></blockquote>
As I said, in his absence I can do no better than repeat his own remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Estimates include a figure of 6 per cent. for pay settlements and 11 per cent. for inflation. Will the Minister tell us what will happen in the event of these limits being exceeded? Will the Government make up any necessary shortfall? In view of the degree of poverty, level of unemployment and low car population in Scotland, particularly in the west of Scotland, we require a good, efficient and cheap public transport system. The latest figures show that 49 per cent, of Scottish householders have no car. Public transport must be viewed as an essential ingredient to the life blood of Scotland and treated as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister in his opening remarks asked about what Labour's policies were. Let me tell him. We will give priority to the maintenance and improvement of public transport within an integrated transport system. A national transport planning authority will be established to co-ordinate the various transport services to ensure the best use of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Longer holidays and sunnier days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will ensure that the present rail network is maintained and improved with increased investment, including a selective programme of electrification. As much freight as possible must be carried by rail, and we shall extend the scheme of grants to companies to instal rail facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will continue the necessary safeguards to protect existing standards and the network of bus services, and encourage the permanent and substantial public support which bus services need if social needs are to be met and fares kept at reasonable levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will extend to all areas the system of fares-free local travel for the elderly and disabled, which are operated in some places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will sort out the present confusion surrounding children's fares by providing free fares up to five, and reduced fares up to sixteen. The present free school transport arrangements, which the Tories tried to abolish, will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will encourage the development of effective traffic management schemes along with improvements in public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will carry out a selective road building programme which takes full account of economic, environmental and safety needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we will reverse the Tory attempt to diminish the role of the public sector in transport. We believe that the public interest—not private profit—should determine the structure of transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) on his debut on the Opposition Front Bench. I assume
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
that, with the combined pressures of reselection and boundary reviews, we shall see a progression of Glasgow Labour Members coming to the Opposition Front Bench in order to improve their prospects in the travails that are to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would also accept that we would appreciate it if he would extend the same courtesy to some of his own Back Benchers, who must experience similar difficulties because of the redrawing of boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that many of my hon. Friends will in the course of this Parliament become Ministers and so come to the Front Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the hon. Member for Shettleston for that fascinating glimpse into the Labour Party's manifesto for the next election. I was not under the impression that the manifesto had yet been framed. I am not sure whether the views he expressed are those of the party conference, of the parliamentary party, or just his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a draft manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman said he had a daft manifesto, or a draft manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A draft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A draft, I am sorry. I have no doubt that that will become clearer in the months to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the specific points that were raised in the course of the debate. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) asked me about Sumburgh. I visited Sumburgh when I was in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, and I appreciate the problems that have been caused there by landing charges. We had an initial meeting at official level with the Civil Aviation Authority two or three weeks ago. This will be a continuing process to see whether we can make some improvements in that particular problem. When I was in Shetland I also asked the island's council if it could indicate to the Government its view on airport policy. We have the very curious situation that in a tiny island with a tiny population we have Sumburgh airport, we have Scatsa, we have Tingwall, we have the strip at Balta sound and Unst. This is a greater provision of landing strips than in Central Scotland. That clearly indicates that some statement of policy by the island's council on what it sees as the priorities, with the existing facilities, would be extremely valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also correctly pointed out that freight was important for the island communities. I emphasise that the new help that we have given to P and O, in particular, has made an enormous improvement there, particularly as—at the request of the island communities—we have concentrated that help on exports rather than imports and therefore given a boost to the economy of the island. In addition to that, the help we have given for the very first time to bulk cargo carriers, such as the Glenlight and Shetland lines, has also made a substantial difference in the area of freight. We share the right hon. Gentleman's view that that is, and must remain, a priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) for his most unexpected tribute. We recognise the irritation that can often be
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
caused by what seems to be a rigid or unimaginative approach to signposting policy. Obviously the main purpose on a trunk road is to give specific directions that will be of assistance to the person using that trunk road. We cannot have a proliferation of signposts, so it is up to the planning authority to put whatever signs it considers appropriate and to permit whatever signs it thinks appropriate on non-trunk roads. We have tended to provide signposting of the kind to which my hon. Friend referred on roads such as the A9. It was deliberately improved to bypass all the existing communities. Therefore, the viability of those communities depended to some extent on signposting, particularly as no petrol facilties were available on the main road. That was a deliberate act of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could perhaps expand on these matters if I wrote to my hon. Friend on this issue. I appreciate that it is a point of some concern. Indeed, I met a deputation from Tayside regional council on the question of the A94 at Forfar some weeks ago. I promised to write to the council when we came to a conclusion on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked me about the consequences for the Trenant and Musselburgh bypass of the decision by the National Coal Board not to go ahead with opencast coalmining in that area. He is quite correct to point to the fact that that decision will lead to significant extra cost for the Musselburgh bypass. We expect it to be in the region of £3 million. At this stage we believe that it will be possible to maintain the existing time scale for these developments. We certainly hope to ensure that these programmes begin on the dates that were previously announced and that no change will be necessary as a result of that announcement. I cannot give a categorical assurance to that effect, but that is certainly our belief at the present time. If there is any change, I shall of course let the hon. Gentleman know. But at the moment we believe that it will be possible to maintain the existing time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lothian regional council's assistance to the Scottish Transport Group has been dealt with on a previous occasion. I do not want to spend any time on that, save only to emphasise that the external financing limits of the Scottish Transport Group, like all industries, allow for help of this kind. But the sheer volume of extra subsidy that the regional council wished to give to the Scottish Transport Group could not be accommodated within the existing external finance limits. That was an important consideration which had to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the right hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) for his tribute to the Government and for his clear and unqualified recognition of the significant help that Government have given to the island communities which he represents as a result of our increased help for shipping services. It is always difficult for one party to compliment another party's Administration on these matters. I pay tribute to him for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested that both he and the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland indicated that they were not terribly interested whether or not we had road equivalent tariff as long as the real level of subsidy was improved and increased and real help was given. Comments of that kind from some quarters, contrast
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
ing with other representations that have been in favour of RET, have made it more difficult to come to a conclusion on this matter. But we shall bear the comments of both right hon. Gentlemen in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) said that electrification was primarily a matter for the Department of Transport. However, my right hon. Friend will obviously be anxious to ensure that Scotland gets a fair share if proposals for electrification go forward. Obviously the Scottish end of the rail network is an important part of the infrastructure, and the Scottish Office will certainly lose no opportunity to ensure that that is very much taken on board in any decisions that are to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of principle, even if the amount of money and the timetable are not known, the system of financing such a development must be known. If we are to have electrification—say, to Cumbernauld or to Ayr—who will foot the bill or what apportionment will there be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that British Rail put forward various options for different levels of electrification in its submission to the Government. Obviously it will be for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport to indicate which of these options, if any, the Government have adopted. It will depend on which option has been chosen which areas will be most likely to be affected by any electrification. If the hon. Gentleman consults British Rail, he will see that the question of electrification in the west of Scotland will be partly dependent on the sort of options that might ultimately be chosen by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the particular question of the Glasgow to Ayr route, if a decision is taken by the regional council, the full cost will come within the transport allocation, and the question of a specific grant can only be considered if there are special circumstances. My right hon. Friend has said that he will be prepared to consider sympathetically whether help can be given if—and only if—the regional council takes the decision that it wishes to go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) raised the question of the Perth to Aberdeen dualling and rightly commented that, given that the implementation of our dualling policy could only begin the moment we came into office, much of the initial period has obviously involved preparatory work on the design and planning aspects of the work that has to take place. We share with him the desire to make the provision of bypasses to serve the main communities the main priority in terms of the dualling the road, though it is our objective to ensure that ultimately the whole road is dualled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend specifically asked about Forfar. At the moment it is intended that the construction work on the Forfar bypass should begin in 1984/85 and it is likely to take two years for the contract to be completed. We will see whether that project can be brought forward and accelerated in any way. The main problem at the moment relates to technical matters—in particular, drainage, which is proving to be of some complexity and may have a significant effect on the time scale. If these practical and procedural problems can
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
be overcome, we recognise the importance of the Forfar bypass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that those technical problems would exist whether the road were a single or a dual carriage bypass?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the problems to which I have just referred would have been equally relevant, whether it was a single or a dual carriageway. Therefore, the decision to make it a dual carriageway has in no way delayed the commencement of this project so far as the drainage issues are concerned. The local community will benefit from the scale of the road and will not lose out in time scale as a consequence. I know that will be a great relief to the local community and perhaps to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In connection with the completion of that dual carriageway, a very difficult situation occurs as one enters Stonehaven. The road has caused such a problem that it has meant the erection of a Bailey bridge, which causes great delays during the tourist season to traffic to the oil and gas operations in my constituency. Can the Minister give an indication whether there will be an acceleration of the repairs there, which are part of the dual carriageway project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give my hon. Friend a specific answer on that particular point at the moment. I shall write to him on the detailed point which he has just raised and let him know the position so far as the area outside Stonehaven is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael). He raised the question of bridge tolls and his views on the need for such tolls. One recognises the irritation that tolls can cause to those who live in the immediate vicinity and who use the bridge on a regular basis. The Government's position is that, at a time of reduced expenditure overall, it would be difficult to forgo the substantial revenue resulting from such bridge tolls. Clearly, any loss of revenue resulting from such a decision would have to be made up elsewhere. Looking at the priorities, it seems more sensible not to forgo existing sources of revenue in order to ensure that the maximum use can be made of the overall funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin), referred to the railway workshops in his constituency. I can understand that the future employment prospects of the apprentices to whom he referred is a matter of legitimate concern. If he wishes to raise that matter, he should clearly direct it to the Secretary of State for Transport as it is a matter which would come within his departmental responsibility. However, I suspect that a direct approach to British Rail might be useful in pursuance of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I think the debate has shown that there are two levels of concern to hon. Members. They are the very natural points that affect each individual Member in his constituency. The various answers which I have given illustrate that an enormous amount is happening in Scotland in the transport sphere. So far as general transport policy is concerned, literally hundreds of millions of pounds are being spent in Scotland to ensure a very effective transport infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) was completely off beam in suggesting that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
the policies of successive Governments had led to neglect of Scotland's transport needs. If one looks at the superb motorway structure throughout the whole of central Scotland, which clearly is the consequence of successive Governments' policies, one can see that the whole of Scotland now has a level of infrastructure which makes it of enormous benefit to the economic prospects of the country. I do not doubt that the many improvements which are currently in train, and which will continue over the next few years, will ensure that the economic requirements of Scotland will in no way
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
be prejudiced by inadequate transport facilities. In that respect, I think that successive Governments can take great pride in what has been achieved and what will be achieved over the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
