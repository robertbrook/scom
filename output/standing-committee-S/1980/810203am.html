	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
This is the sittings motion which I said last Thursday it was my intention to move. Hon Gentlemen have indicated their desire to ensure that we have a full debate on each of the important measures in the Bill, particularly on clause 13, with which we were dealing when we adjourned on Thursday. Therefore, it seems more appropriate, in the interests of the Committee, that they should have the opportunity to sit in the afternoons as well, to ensure full and complete debate. On that basis, I commend the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Shaw. This morning I saw on my way into the building one of the Committee notices, which said that we would be meeting at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm on 3 and 5 February. Is it in order that a notice of intention to meet appears before the Question has been debated by the Committee? One appreciates the Minister's desire to expedite business, but that is somewhat presumptuous, surely. I would like the notices to be withdrawn, if that should be your wish, Mr. Shaw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is right to raise that matter. I have noted it, and will take steps to see that as far as possible it does not occur again. However, that will not affect the proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Committee Mr. Shaw. Scarborough, your constituency, is not too far from Scotland, and the local authorities there might well learn something from what has been taking place in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon Gentleman speaking to the motion or to an amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking against the motion, Mr. Shaw, because I was told that it would not be in order to submit a manuscript amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel that there is no need to meet twice a week in the afternoon. We are proceeding with the Bill at a fairly steady pace, and have now reached clause 13, probably the most controversial part. We are giving it our earnest attention. On the basis of the amount of speaking from the Government Benches, there would be no case for our meet-
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
ing more than once a fortnight, because contributions from Conservative Members, with the exception of the Under-Secretary, are virtually non-existent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that there is apparently some threat of a Lothian campaign, but it seems at the moment to be conducted more through the pages of 	<i>The Evening News,</i> Edinburgh, than here, though we wait with bated breath. It may well be that the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) has so much to say that it will be necessary for us to meet in constant sitting. What he has said in the past on the matter has tended to be somewhat repetitive, and either you, Mr. Shaw, or Mr. Gourlay would very quickly have the responsibility to call him to order, as I am sure you would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that there is no need to meet twice a week in the afternoon. The business is being dealt with in a good-natured and sensible manner. We have yet to see any major concessions from the Minister, but we live in hope. We feel that in the brief and temperate manner in which we are addressing ourselves to this legislation the good sense of our case will eventually penetrate through, and we are confident that we do not need many extra hours of debate for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second problem. This is fairly complicated legislation, and the Opposition need as much time as possible to prepare our speeches. It has been suggested that we probably need more time than we have had already. Certainly, the complicated nature of the legislation requires us to be in constant touch with the local authorities in Scotland, to hear their views on the nuances of the Minister's remarks and the manner in which he seeks to appear moderate and reasonable, when introducing what to all intents and purposes are tyrannical powers over the legitimate activities of local authorities. Rather than have four sittings a week, there is a strong case for meeting only once a week, but we will not push that case too strongly at this stage. Moreover, there is no point in rushing the Bill through to have an effect in the financial year 1981-82. I will go into that in a minute or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same glance as afforded me sight of the presumptuous notice of the frequency of our meetings suggested to me that no other Committee at present meeting has sought powers to meet twice a day. No Department of the Government, apart from the Scottish Office, has this indecent haste to get its proposals on to the statute book. Last year, when we had equally controversial legislation—the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill and the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill—the Committees considering those Bills eventually went four sittings a week, but they did not do it after only the sixth sitting. No great log jam of Government legislation is in prospect, although one can imagine the incompetence of the managers of the Government's business perhaps repeating last year's performances. However, with 'the removal of the former Leader of the House and 'his replacement by the former Secretary of State for Defence there may well be a smoother passage of legislation. Certainly, we feel that this hysterical attempt by the Government to accelerate the proceedings of the Committee is unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
I turn to another aspect. This Committee has within its ranks many members of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. I know from my own experience when I was a member of the Committee on the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill last year that those hon Members found it very difficult to maintain close contact with the passage of the legislation while undertaking the serious and important work of the Select Committee. I can appreciate that the Select Committee's formal activities, in terms of meetings, are not too onerous and time-consuming, but the wide range and the significance of its studies are such that a great deal of preparatory work—reading and general research— has to be undertaken by the members. The work load of the members of the Select Committee is such that they would be much happier to have only two meetings—or, as I said earlier, perhaps only one meeting—per week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), as a senior Member of the House, has many commitments outwith this Standing Committee. He has expressed concern to me that he may not be able to attend and give this important legislation his fullest care and consideration if we are required to meet on four occasions a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>House Magazine</i> is a very helpful publication, which details the various activities of the House, Back Bench Committees and various meetings included in the all-party Whip. With every week that passes there are more and more meetings. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays there are probably more than most of us have the time to attend. For example, today members of the British Spanish Parliamentary Group have a very important meeting to elect officers at 4 pm, and it may well not have finished by 4.30. The British-Jordanian Parliamentary Group also meets at 4 pm. The All-Party Transport Safety Group meets at 5 pm, the All Party Disablement Group at 5.30 pm, and the CPA—UK Branch, British Caribbean Group, at 6.30 pm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go through what is happening on Thursday as well. There is then a meeting of All-party Group on the Canadian Constitution. My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) will doubtless insist that he is prepared to forgo that meeting, because of the significance of this Committee. But the meeting is a matter of some significance for Scotland, given our longstanding links with Canada, and because Scotsmen were to a great extent instrumental in the creation of the State of Canada. On Thursday there will be divided loyalties, probably on the part of Conservative hon Members as well, who will wish to be fully briefed about this controversial and important piece of legislation. They will be denied that opportunity because of the extra sittings that are called for in the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably the most important meetings that Back Benchers have to attend during the week are the 1922 Committee for the Conservatives, and the Parliamentary Labour Party, where we discuss the business of the week and the conduct of affairs. For us to be denied the opportunity to attend these meetings creates considerable difficulty for Back
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
Benchers. That is another consideration that the Minister, in his somewhat high-handed way, has chosen to ignore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One appreciates that a Conservative Minister is not in attendance at 1922 Committee meetings, but, as I understand the constitutional complexities of the Conservative Party in iPariiament—and I must confess that it is difficult enough trying to follow 'the constitutional affairs of the Labour Party—I imagine that the assiduous and conscientious Members on the Government Back Benches will wish to play a full part in the activities of that committee. Today we are very pleased to welcome back the hon Member for Edinburgh, South, who is vice-chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I did not realise that the hon Gentleman was that important. He is a man of ever-increasing importance in the Conservative Party in Scotland, rising in status by the hour. He will clearly need to be at a meeting of that nature. I am sure that there will be divided loyalties that the hon Member will have to sort out for himself. He will have to decide whether to play his part in the 1922 Committee or whether he should be here defending his Government's legislation. It is a very difficult choice and one which I feel it is most unfair to impose on Back Benchers. The Minister should reconsider the motion, for that reason if for no other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the complexity of the legislation, we need to have meetings and consultations down here, but on Mondays and Fridays many of us spend some time in Scotland consulting on a personal basis the local authorities concerned. We have to travel the length and breadth of Scotland to meet them, because nearly 60 authorities are affected by this legislation, and they are all anxious that their case should be heard. On occasions we have had statements from COSLA. Written circulars from pressure groups are never the same as face-to-face meetings. These meetings, which take place in Scotland, require us to be away from the House at times. That means that our opportunity to catch the eye of the Chair, it is virtually obligatory for a Member to sit throughout the whole the proceedings. 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is to be a debate today on a very important Supply day motion on poverty. Many of us with pockets of deprivation in our constituencies wish to participate, but, once again, we are being deprived. The fact that some of us are down here effectively for three or four days a week means that we have to cram much of our activities into that time. To have this additional burden of five hours in Committee each week, and the necessary time for preparation, means in effect that we shall have only a brief opportunity to participate in the activities of the House. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) for his sedentary intervention. I wish he would make it louder so that everyone could hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that my hon Friend had a devastatingly strong case, and that I hoped that Conservative hon Members were paying attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that means that I am being damned with faint praise, but I take what praise I can from whatever quarter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the nature of this legislation, we are having to have meetings in Scotland. That presents difficulties for us in seeking to maximise the impact which we can make in the House. I said that an important debate was taking place today, in which many of us would like to take part. We are denied the right, because we shall be here until 7.30 pm. As you know well, Mr. Shaw, in a debate where there is a great demand for an opportunity to catch the eye of the Chair, it is virtually obligatory for a Member to sit throughout the whole of the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occasions such as this, the sitting-in process is virtually impossible. It is certainly very difficult, if a Committee is starting at 4.30 pm, to listen to speeches from the Front Bench which in effect lay the ground upon which the debate will take place. So our membership of this committee will effectively, not disfranchise us, but prevent us from making any sizeable contribution to what I consider to be extremely important debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is likely that in the forthcoming weeks the Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill will be debated. If it is to be debated on a Tuesday or Thursday, and if this motion is passed, I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at the possibility of suspending the sitting of this Committee in order that members of it who wish to do so may participate. I do not make a party point, but a personal point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever there is a request from the Opposition to suspend a sitting of a Committee, or for a Committee not to sit on a particular afternoon, for particular reasons, it will always be possible to see whether agreement can be reached on the progress of business to enable the Opposition's request to be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expected that reply from the Minister. In his normal courteous manner he has given us a somewhat barbed reply, which means that if he reaches the clause which he wants to reach, he will seek to suspend the Committee. I accept that that is his right and privilege, but it is unfortunate that this rather acid and callous approach to business should be adopted. However, I accept that the hon Gentleman is to all intents and purposes in the driving seat in this respect and that he can exact from us whatever he can get.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that I may be labouring this point, but it is essential that we make it clear that the burden of the work which the extra sittings will entail will not only jeopardise the work of Select Committees. Distinguished members of this Committee have multifarious interests in the House—I speak specifically of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central. It will make his work load, which is
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
onerous and very creditable, even more difficult if he has to be present here while other meetings of some significance in the House are taking place. The motion will also inhibit Members from participating not necessarily on purely Scottish matters—we have had a reasonably helpful intimation from the Minister that we may be able to have some come and go on Scottish questions—but on other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to talk specifically about Thursday. There are those of us who like to get up to Scotland fairly quickly. Some Members perhaps regard themselves as Scottish Members first and Westminster Members second, but I know that I can acquit all members of the Committee of such a charge. However, it is important that we recognise that on a Thursday evening, if Members wish to go back to their constituencies when the Whipping is light here, the transport arrangements are not all that helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to finish at 7 pm on a Thursday k might just be possible for Members who live in the West of Scotland to get the 8.15 pm shuttle flight to Glasgow airport. But people like me who live in the East of Scotland would be dependent upon the 7.40 pm shuttle. Those of us who are deprived of lifts in ministerial limousines and such like, and are dependent, therefore, on the somewhat doubtful regularity of the services provided by London Transport are in grave danger of missing that plane and are forced on to the sleeper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happen to be one of those fortunate people who can sleep anywhere, and have done so on occasions, but many of my colleagues find it a great burden to have to travel by the sleeper. I am sure that the nods of approbation from those sitting alongside you, Mr. Shaw, bear witness to the fact that, very pleasant and comfortable though the sleeper facilities may be, they do not necessarily assist the freshness in the morning of those who avail themselves of the service. To be thrown off a train at 7 o'clock on a cold winter's morning on the Waverley station, with the prospect of a heavy day of meetings ahead, is not something which I view with much relish. Many of my colleagues share this concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transport links with Scotland are a very important matter. It is virtually impossible to get up to Scotland in anything under five and a half hours by train. I do not have a copy of Bradshaw, or whatever passes for railway timetables in this day and age, but it is most unlikely that a train leaving at 8 o'clock in the evening will arrive much before 2 o'clock the following morning, when the problems of taxis and so on are considerable. I am sure that expenditure of considerable amounts of Lothian region funds, to which the hon Member for Edinburgh, South will doubtless refer at a later stage, has gone into the excellent Lothian region transport service, but that excellent service is somewhat less than dependable at 2 o'clock in the morning, although there is a fairly good late-night bus service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to meet here on a Thursday evening, how are we to deal with our business in a reasonable way, if we are not to have Members champing at the bit, wanting to get away and concerned about the difficulties and irritations caused by lack of sleep, and the problems we are facing in our con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
stituenoies in respect of this legislation? As I said earlier, local authorities are demanding meetings to have explained to them the consequences of this draconian Bill. We have a responsibility to our constituents and to Scotland, to foe there dm good heart and in good frame of mind in the morning. The prospect of meetings on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons does not bode well for our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should the Government show this indecent haste to carry the legislation through? As far as I can gather from my dealings with the local authorities, it appears that most of them are at the stage of considering their budgetary options. They are 'beginning to draw together 'the figures which will enable them to establish the level of rating for next year. This business will still take some considerable time to complete. By the time consideration of the Bill is completed, it is likely that rate notices will have been sent out. Indeed, I think it most unlikely that the Minister would even expect to be able to use any of the powers in the Bill this year. There is not a prima facie case for the Government's getting the legislation through quickly and then affecting the level of local government expenditure in the foreseeable future. The Minister has been understandably coy about committing himself. He may like to confirm that at present he has no plans to intervene in any of the rating arrangements for any of the Scottish local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman considers the provisions of the Bill he will see that the part that we are on is to apply for the year 1981-82.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the Minister for making that point. There is no need, 'therefore, for us to dive into this legislation, to make it effective right away. Although it will take effect in 1981-82, the fact is that once the Bill is passed, we Shall have a period in which the Secretary of State will consider the level of local government expenditure envisaged in the forthcoming year by the local authorities in Scotland. He will consider this under a variety of headings and criteria, which will doubtless be produced after consideration of clauses 13, 14, 18 and 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once those criteria are laid down, if the Secretary of State comes to 'the conclusion that the level of expenditure will be excessive and unreasonable, that the rates burden imposed on the householder and on the domestic and industrial ratepayer will be excessive and unreasonable, there is every likelihood that be will seek a meeting with the local authorities. They will need time to prepare their case. It will then foe submitted to the Minister, who in his turn will take time to consider it once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are probably talking about some time in May or June of this year, by when the expenditure patterns laid down by local authorities will foe in train. If there can foe no satisfactory agreement between the two sides about what is excessive and what is unreasonable, there will be a period of some tension between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman's hon Friends are all leaving. The hon Gentleman can leave as well if he likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such is the burden of work on my colleagues that they have had to leave the Committee room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could return to the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is likely that there will be recourse to the courts for consideration of what is excessive or unreasonable. I am not sure what your profession is, Mr. Shaw, but I am sure that you appreciate, as I do, that the courts deal with such matters slowly, and they grind exceeding fine. The House could well have gone into recess before the judgments of the courts have been handed down. Important though the Government may believe it to foe to control the expenditure of local authorities, it is not sufficiently important for them to recall the House in September, prior to the Conservative, Liberal and Labour conferences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are then talking about debating 'the Government's intention to cut the level of rate support grant to local authorities, on the grounds that the envisaged level of expenditure is excessive and unreasonable, round about October or November. This will result in a vote in the House, and then there will be an attempt by the local authority to make the cuts at the diktat of the Minister. By then it will be somewhere round about December 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cumbersome nature of this legislation, the way in which it seeks to interfere with local authority expenditure and the slow-moving nature of the (interference, are such that there is no need for us to rush this legislation through. We may well discover that the many amendments which the Minister has seen fit to put down will require us to meet more frequently, because of mistakes by draftsmen or the fact that the Government have discovered that the legislation will not work. But, if we set aside that part of the argument, the Government's desire to have this legislation passed quickly will not make a great deal of difference to the expenditure of local authorities in the course of a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to remove local democracy, local autonomy, from local authorities, so foe it—the House will decide. But to have additional burdens imposed on the members of the Committee simply to suit the whim and fancy of the Minister is wholly unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have suggested, the Bill will not make one bit of difference to expenditure in 1981-82 until such a stage in the financial year of the local authority that the savings will foe virtually impossible to carry through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to the fact that the Minister has not accepted the .responsibility which the motion puts upon him. He has simply said that he wants to deal with the Bill more quickly. As a result of meeting more frequently we shall probably deal with the matter less thoroughly than we have so far. Hitherto Conservative Members, by their tacit ap-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
proval of the legislation, have done precious little to contribute any serious thought to the matter. It may well be that they are so pleased with the Bill that they are prepared to leave it to the Under-Secretary to do all the work. That is unreasonable, because on occasions he has obviously needed assistance and friendship, and has had it denied by the mute Members behind him. It is even less likely that they will he prepared to contribute if their work load is increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the complicated nature of the legislation, we have made good progress so far. We have covered 12 clauses in six sittings, which is not unreasonable progress by any yardstick. We are now on clause 13, which reintroduces the concepts of "excessive and unreasonable" once again, which are not new in Scottish local government legislation. They were in the 1947 legislation and in the 1966 legislation, although, if we get on to the amendments which we were discussing last week, you will be made aware, Mr. Shaw, that the Government are seeking to turn on its head the 1966 legislation. As an excuse, they say that what the 1966 Labour Government sought to introduce was similar to what the present Government seek to introduce. We dispute that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important question, one which is somewhat complicated and needs a great deal of time to consider. It is not one which can be hurried. The treatment of clauses 13 and 14 must not be hurried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18 is very important for Scottish local authorities, because about 54 per cent, of Scottish households—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman has made it very clear that this is an important Bill. He is in danger of repeating himself rather a lot. I am sure that it would give great pleasure to the whole Committee to be able to get on to discuss the terms of the rest of the Bill, but we cannot discuss them under the motion. I was most encouraged by the hon Gentleman's telling me that later this morning I should be let into the argument on the rest of clause 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Shaw, for that helpful statement. You will understand that it is not for me to presume as to whether my colleagues will allow me that opportunity, in that, with their fertile imaginations, they will be able to bring other arguments to bear on this horrendous motion. However, I do not wish to be discourteous and I would not challenge your ruling, Mr. Shaw. I was simply endeavouring to point out to you the significance of this legislation and its component parts. I was endeavouring to embellish the point by drawing attention to clause 18, which is of considerable significance and is of such complexity and importance that we cannot afford to rush it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many parts of the Bill which we will not oppose. Local authority control of the sale of methylated spirits is not a matter about which we will go to the stake or to the barricades. The Bill has many inoffensive areas where we shall be able to make adequate progress, where it will be possible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
us to skate through it, as we have done over the last 12 clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one area where we shall have to proceed more slowly. There are already on the Amendment Paper many new clauses which people outside have asked us to consider. Two hon Members have been asked to put forward amendments to the valuation procedures in respect of piping in oil refineries. There are one or two parts of Scotland which this matter affects, one of which is Grangemouth, on to which my constituency abuts. It is a matter of great concern to me and to my hon Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), because it could greatly affect the rating arrangements for our local authorities. It is necessary for us, because of the new clause, to enter into discussions with the external promoter of the clauses—British Petroleum, which pays what in its eyes are excessive rates in Scotland. For similar property in England it pays considerably less, and it would like the position regularised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is explaining amendments which will probably be discussed later on in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to have meetings with British Petroleum tomorrow—time-consuming meetings, I should imagine. The point that I am making— without going into the merits—is that not only does the substance of the Bill require us to take time and have meetings, but a plethora of amendments and new clauses will come through. They have attracted considerable interest among a variety of groups within Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is a substantial part of the Bill to which nobody on either side has attached a great deal of significance, in terms of wishing to oppose it. However, we will wish to consider it seriously, and to look at it in great detail because it is important to the individuals concerned. The sellers of methylated spirits have rights and responsibilities, and may not want us to pass over them lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those parts of the Bill which are complicated require our consideration in a leisurely and untrammelled manner. The way in which the Minister has sought to justify his motion is most unsatisfactory. He has not addressed himself to any of the points which I have raised. I can appreciate his desire to get the Bill out of the way because he thinks it a complicated bore. There are many other problems in Scotland which he would like to wrestle with, and which the people of Scotland might consider far more important. But the Minister has chosen to introduce this legislation, and it will affect the lives, responsibilities and activities of many people in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This legislation will not necessarily make any great impact in the areas to which the Minister wishes to direct his legislative attention in a particularly expeditious way. Therefore, we are not talking about meaningful local government expenditure in 1981-82. If this Bill is to have any effect at all—and I am doubtful whether it will, Mr. Shaw—it will be in 1982-83. Because of the cumbersome way in which it will be applied, the legislation will be more of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
encouragement than a discouragement to what the Minister would regard as recalcitrant authorities. Nowhere in the Bill does the Minister have the power to reduce the rates charged by local authorities. He can merely withdraw an element of rate support grant. So the question of time is not involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We put a special case to you, Mr. Shaw, an Englishman, on the grounds of the geographical situation in which we find ourselves in Scotland. The transport difficulties are considerable. We have the problems of getting up to Scotland on a Thursday evening, the difficulties of a sleeper, the problems of catching planes, the difficulties of getting to the airport. All these aspects have to be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of what could happen with other Scottish legislation. We are not happy with being blackmailed by the Minister into having to make concessions simply in order that we can undertake our proper and correct constituency responsibilities by debating important legislation on the Floor of the House. If we have to get a passport to the Floor of the House by grovelling to the Minister and making feeble concessions, simply in order to undertake our constituency duties, that is a danger for parliamentary democracy, about which the Opposition are most concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are most worried about crucial legislation—for example, measures relating to our education system. We should not be denied the opportunity to participate in the discussion on these matters simply because we happen to be on this Committee and because the Minister is not prepared to accept our desire to attend those discussions and because he wants to exact from us concessions which we will have been blackmailed into making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, Mr. Shaw, I am grateful that you have been prepared to listen to our points. I realise that debate on a motion of this nature strains the good will of the Chair on occasions. I have tried to make a case based on the best traditions of this House, in the sense that we have to ensure the rights of Members to carry on their work in a sensible well-organised manner. I have sought this morning to defend the rights of the members of this Committee, hon Members who work extremely hard and who regard this imposition as being unsatisfactory and unnecessary. It would not only inhibit our activities within the Palace of Westminster, but undermine the effectiveness of our contribution to public life in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that no case has been put forward by the Minister, though it may be that his hon Friends will jump up once I have sat down to rebut some of my points. I should be grateful to hear their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point to which I wish to return is that the thrust of this legislation is to introduce draconian controls on local authorities. Those controls will not be effective this year. Therefore, there is no need for us to rush this legislation through in this indecent manner. There is no case for rushing the Bill through, unless the Minister wants to be the first Minister to get his Bill through this Session. We do not see the legislative burden as being as heavy as it was last year. The log jam and the embarrassment which the Government got into last
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
year would appear likely to be avoided this year, so there is no need for Bills to be rushed through. We appreciate that there are other pieces of Scottish legislation in the pipeline, but they will be treated in the thorough and sensible manner which the Opposition usually adopt in addressing themselves to Government legislation. We do not think there will be any undue delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far the progress on the Bill has been satisfactory. No other legislation at present going through the House seems to require additional Committee sittings. As I said earlier, I took the trouble of checking the notice board which had the presumptuous notice about the meetings of the First Scottish Standing Committee. It may well be an error, but none of the other Committees would appear to have the presumption—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot discuss that, because it is not the responsibility of anybody within the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Shaw, and I shall not press the point. All I was trying to say was that no other Standing Committee is at present having more than one sitting per day. Legislation which is more complicated, more detailed, more difficult to handle than ours—the transport legislation, for example, the telecommunications legislation, and other Bills—is being dealt with in a calm, reasoned manner, unlike the indecent haste with which the Minister wishes to rush this Bill through. It is most unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very disappointed. We know the Minister on occasions to be a reasonable man, and we should like to appeal to him once again. Last year on the tenants' rights Bill we had extra sittings, but that was considerably later. Maybe the burden of office is shortening the Minister's patience. This may be because the Government have failed to realise their economic objectives. I do not know. We do not know the pressures on Ministers in marginal seats. But these difficulties are certainly not contributing to the good government of the country, and they are certainly not contributing to the serious consideration of the legislation before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most regrettable, Mr. Shaw, that your visit to the Committee should be marred by such an unnecessary and irrelevant motion, and that what would have been a worthwhile educational experience for you has been interfered with, because we have had to try to fend off what we consider to be a most unsatisfactory proposal, which will in no way accelerate the passage of the Bill. It is not our intention to cooperate in any way to ensure the speedier treatment of the Bill, simply because the Minister is seeking to twist our arms into having two sittings a day, two days a week. We shall carry on at the same steady pace, and those parts of the Bill which require serious consideration may well take longer now, because we may have to reapportion the work load in such a way that some hon Members will have to give more time to it and others will have to give less. If that is the case, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sorry that this intrusion into our business has taken place. We feel that it is totally unnecessary, it is most unsatisfactory that the Minister has put forward such a feeble case in trying to justify what we regard as a draconian imposition. I am sure that many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
of my hon Friends will wish to join me in expressing our disapproval of the motion and giving notice of our intention to oppose it when the opportunity arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be remiss of me if 1 did not compliment my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) on the most exciting 50 minutes of speech-making that we have heard in the Committee. I have certainly been persuaded by his arguments. Indeed, I am sure that my position is no different from that of all the other members of the Committee who listened attentively to what my hon Friend said. I should like to say something in support of his admirable case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why we should meet in the afternoon on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am surprised that the Minister has felt that he should move such a motion. The precise need for it escapes me. I think that the Government will succeed in getting their Bill, provided they accept some of the very reasonable amendments in the names of my hon Friends and others. If the Government show that willingness, we shall not have serious difficulties with the timetable. After all, the Bill, which rambles and chunters over the whole field of local government in Scotland, is not like the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, which the Minister also handled on behalf of the Government. It is very different in its terms and in the response it has received in the country. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 was an extremely controversial measure, deeply resented and much resisted by all sorts of people—not least the legal profession. I shall not go on about that, because that is not what we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to say that this Bill is a very technical measure. We are arguing about the technicalities of local government administration. I shall have plenty to say about that as we move through the Bill. I am as anxious as the Government are to reach clauses of interest to me, but I do not see why the hon Gentleman should move the motion, because I believe that the Committee was making reasonable progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for being absent for two weeks due to illness, I thank all hon Members for their many expressions of good wishes, floral and otherwise. When I last attended the Committee, I was impressed by the pace at which we were proceeding. When my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) telephoned me to express his wishes for my speedy recovery, he told me that the Committee had reached clause 13, and I was astonished. But the Minister has said this morning that we must meet on Thursday afternoon, as well as Tuesday afternoon, because he is dissatisfied with the progress so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) has said much about consultation. That has been the central theme of his arguments throughout consideration of the Bill. On each clause he has said, either in the Committee or to me, that there may be a case for consultation, because every clause deals with a specific aspect of Scottish local government, and there is a specialist interest. The Opposition are receiving advice from organisations concerned with each interest —COSLA, the other local local authority associations, and the major trade unions concerned in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also specialist organisations in local
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
government. They are made up in the main of small groups of highly professionally qualified staff in local government. They are submitting to us their views on each aspect of the Bill. If we pass the sittings motion, we reduce the opportunity of the Opposition, especially those of us who take a specialist interest in local government, to involve ourselves directly with those organisations. That removes an opportunity for consultation and the likelihood of the Committee's benefiting from the detailed information that those organisations can give us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have quickly scanned through the Bill to remind myself of all the people involved with what we are doing in the Committee. They include the finance officers, the environmental health officers—perhaps a this point I should say that I am the vice-president of the Scottish Environmental Health Institute—the new towns, the housing officers, the Scottish Institute of Housing, the assessors, the Ombudsman and the education officers. They are all involved in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The finance officers are obviously interested in clauses 13 to 16; the housing officers have a direct interest in clauses 18 to 20; the Scottish Ombudsman has an involvement with clauses 21 and 22 and schedule 1. There is a repeal of licensing provisions in respect of new towns. I represent the new town of Cumbernauld, and I want the opportunity to consult the Cumbernauld development corporation, which, through that clause, is losing powers, and the local authority, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth district council. I want to hear directly from the council how it feels about taking on certain licensing provisions. There are staff involved in all this, of course, and I want to discuss the position with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Water purification officers are directly affected by the Bill, as are the analysts. It happens that I know them well. I am sorry that the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is not here this morning; he makes a habit of missing my excellent contributions, and I hope that he will not object to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is straying rather far. He may give a summary, by all means, to emphasise the point that he is making, but to go into detail is not within the terms of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Shaw, I am sorry if I am straying from the path. I am endeavouring to say that the local authorities and the bodies directly associated with them have an interest in the Bill which makes it incumbent upon us, as members of the Committee, to consult them immediately and urgently on everything that is taking place. Members of the Committee could be locked up in this Committee room on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I do not know what the arrangements will be for Thursdays, but, if they are anything like my experience on another Bill, the opportunity for consultation will be greatly reduced. That was what I was trying to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to pay tribute to the constituency of the hon Gentleman who is not here, not criticise him. I was going to refer to the Tay river purification board, with which I have had dealings in the past, but I shall not deal with that, Mr. Shaw, because you have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
properly drawn my attention to what would be appropriate in a speech to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government in such a hurry to put through a Bill which ranges over the technicalities of local government? Although there are exceptions to what I am saying, much of what it proposes will have no immediate impact on the life of Scottish local government. It could be that there are certain clauses which the Government wish to have on the statute book at the earliest possible date because they are related to other stratagems to do with their management of local authorities from the centre, from St. Andrew's House, rather than with the administration of local government at the level of the local authorities. I will say more about that in a moment. The Government have not developed an argument which has convinced me that there is any need for hurry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that we are in what has been described as a light legislative programme. I have little experience of this House, having come in only at the last election. Therefore, I am not acquainted with what is a heavy or light programme of legislation. I was told—and certainly all the press reports stressed it at the time of the Queen's Speech—that we were in a period of a light legislative programme. So what is the hassle? Why is the Under-Secretary in such a fearful hurry? The uncharitable say that he is a young man in a hurry, but I do not share that view. He is a middle-aged man in a hurry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is on an important point. He will be aware that we have got the Education (Scotland) Bill coming up, and also the Bill dealing with family violence, which is largely non-contentious and I think agreed between the parties. As far as I know the only other piece of Scottish legislation which is in the pipeline is a Bill dealing with civic government, and it has already been announced in reply to a written question that the Government are expecting it next Session, not this Session. Therefore, there is practically no Scottish legislation to come at all. We could have a second Scottish Standing Committee if the Government were in difficulties. Would my hon Friend not agree that that makes the sittings motion even more inexplicable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend makes the sort of point for which he is developing a reputation—so clear and precisely to the point. Clearly the Minister will have to tell us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not come here to criticise the Minister. I came to hear from him why we should meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. As far as I can see there is no case for meeting on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, for the very reason that my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewer) has just given about the detail of the legislative programme. Unless the Minister can answer that, we cannot agree to meeting on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. It would be very weak of hon Members opposite to vote for this timetable motion in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
absence of it being demonstrably the case that there had to be such a motion because otherwise there would be a blockage in the passage of Scottish legislation through the House. So far that case has not been demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my point about the Minister being in a hurry. I believe that he is not in a hurry for himself, but in a hurry to put this Bill on the statute book because he wishes to control from the centre the activities of Scottish local authorities in terms of their finance. That is what he wants to do, and he is in a desperate hurry to do it because he is unable to persuade them to adopt the policies of Her Majesty's Government, the reason for that being that these democratically-elected authorities do not accept the mandate of the Government to take up this position. They are right and proper in their resistance and they will have the support of all of us who have the interests of local government at heart. That is why, Mr. Shaw, you are having to listen to these speeches this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), in his excellent speech, made reference to other reasons why the Committee should not sit. He referred to transport and to the activities of Members outside the Committee. I should like to say something about transport to Scotland. There is no doubt that there is not an appreciation of that problem on the part of English Members. I do not like calling them "English Members" because there used to be a rather unfortunate group of people in the House who were always going on about the English Members. However, they have been banished from this place; there are only two refugees and the remainder have departed from the scene. I do not want to use the terminology of the Scottish Nationalists because it is always very distasteful to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is an unfortunate fact that there is not an appreciation on the part of those who live in South-East England, in proximity to London and the House of Commons, and who represent constituencies nearby, of just how much travel is involved for Scottish Members, and that a Friday can be an important constituency day for Scottish Members because it is only on Fridays that they can reach their local authorities, public bodies, companies and all the other organisations that are available to us on a Friday. If we cannot reach our constituencies for a Friday morning we are very often in difficulties. The point which my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire made was very valid. Those of us who are anxious to fulfil a constituency role find it very difficult to do so if we are travelling overnight to Scotland and very often have to travel on from a main terminal station, such as Glasgow Central. That is why the argument that that presents us with some difficulty is fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend also referred to the activities of hon Members. I do not know whether he mentioned in particular those hon Members who serve on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I paid a great deal of attention to what my hon Friend said, but I want to say something about this. I have found that there is a great deal of interest in that Committee in Scotland, in what it does and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
what its members say, and a great deal of background reading has to be done if one is to be an effective member of the Committee. The amount of paper coming in from the Civil Service defies belief, and that from external organisations is very considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have time. This motion is about time. It will be a limitation on the time of a number of us if we find that we have to sit here on Thursday evenings, which, in my opinion is totally unnecessary because we are making progress. Not only is that true of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, but it is also true of the group committees and the all-party committees on which many of us sit. Also on a Thursday, I believe, there is a meeting of the Conservative Party Back Bench 1922 Committee. I do not know what the 1922 Committee is about but I do know that hon Members opposite lay great stock on its importance and that it is a committee of importance to them. Likewise there is a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on a Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is important that hon Members should attend their party groups. There is an interest in the country in what is decided at such meetings because it is in these two major committees of the main parties that decisions are made as to how they will react to Government policy. We all have a duty to our constituents, whether we are Conservative or Labour Members, to participate in the affairs of both these groups. If we do not do that, we are failing in our job. That is why I feel that to meet on a Thursday at times which would overtake our party meetings would be quite wrong. I do not believe it would be understood in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have endeavoured to make six points which I hope will help to persuade hon Members opposite to oppose the sittings motion. The first is that we need time to consult. We are not persuaded that there is a need for this motion. We are not at all certain that there is any hurry because the local authorities have not expressed any anxiety to see this Bill on the statute book. No local authority organisation of any repute in Scotland has said that the Bill ought to be on the statute book as soon as possible. Indeed, many local authority organisations are expressing considerable disquiet about the Bill. Therefore the conclusion must be that there is no particular hurry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we know what the Minister's hurry is. We know that he wishes to get the Bill on the statute book because he wishes to control from the centre the financial activities of the local authorities and to reduce yet again, as this Government have done time after time after time, that area of freedom in the country and to reduce the democratic control of our major local authorities. I find that very regrettable and, frankly, something that I am not in a hurry to see this Government achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If one has not been moved I hope you might accept one at some stage, Mr. Shaw, because it is the only way in which we can deal with a motion which is presented to us as this one has been presented. We do not even have a copy of the motion and we are not quite sure what it is. Do we meet this afternoon and
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
Thursday afternoon? I should like to move a manuscript amendment but in the absence of the motion it is difficult to frame it. The gist of what I would propose would be that we meet other than on Tuesday afternoons. Let us start with one afternoon if the Government want it.

Being on my feet, it is difficult for me to write out a manuscript amendment, but the gist of it would be to exclude from the motion all references to Tuesday afternoons. Therefore, I beg to move, leave out from "meet on" to end and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Four o'clock."</p></blockquote>
I want to give some of the reasons why I move the amendment, but before I do so I should like to put on record the fact that, whatever else may be said about the Committee, there has not been any filibustering up to now. Let us look at what has been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had seven sittings and we have got through no fewer than 12 highly complex, technical and controversial clauses and, through the co-operation and eloquence and understanding of the Opposition side and the eloquent silence of the Government side, we have managed to make unseemly haste. So much so that I have had complaints from some of my constituency members asking what we are doing getting the Bill through at such an unseemly speed. Twelve clauses in seven sittings is some going. That is less than an hour and a half on each clause. And clause 2 is highly complex. Nobody in the Committee, not even the Minister, understands it, and yet we allowed it to go through with very little debate at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) made a point which is worth repeating. One of the great problems of Members here is reading all the material that we get, not only on the Bill but on other things that come our way from all kinds of pressure groups outside, from our constituencies and from national, even international, bodies. One learns to discard a great mass of it. Nevertheless, even after such discarding there is a whole lot of stuff that simply must be read if one is to do an intelligent job. I do not know how many Conservative Members are involved, but there are certainly Labour Members who have a great burden of work on Select Committees of one kind or another. I deliberately did not put my name forward to serve on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs because I am already involved in two other Select Committees. Indeed, there are complaints from my own party, and I think from others, quite legitimately that one ought not to be expected to work on more than one Select Committee because the burden of reading matter is impossible to digest if one is on more than one. It is not only the reading matter but the conflict of the times the Committees sit.

	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
My hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was kind enough to refer to my own experience. I like to feel that I am playing my part in the Select Committee work of the House. It is a very important part of Parliament's work. If we are to reduce the gap between the executive arm of Government and the legislative arm it is essential that the Select Committees should work efficiently and that we should have adequate time to digest the material that is brought to us, not only from Government Departments but from interested bodies. It is an extremely time-consuming exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that you are in the Chair, Mr. Shaw, because you will confirm what I am saying. You and I sit on the Public Accounts Committee. We work in great harmony, in a non-party fashion, until the legislations gets to the Floor of the House, and then we can let our hair down. But you know, as well as I do, the enormous boxfuls of material that we get from the Comptroller and Auditor General, and from the Clerks who serve us very well. I have a great box upstairs, and so have you. They are empty at the moment because we are just starting a new set of investigations, but they will fill. They might be full now, after yesterday. The Public Accounts Committee sits every Monday and Wednesday afternoon, at 4 o'clock or 4.30 or 4.45, or whatever, for two or two and a half hours. We did not finish last night until about 7.15, having sat from 4 o'clock. That Committee not only involves its members upstairs; it also involves them in getting out and about, and in trying to read as much as they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top that, I am also a member of the Select Committee on Procedure, which happens to be sitting this afternoon. We had to arrange the timing of the sitting of that Committee in order to convenience me, among others, so that they would not conflict with Monday afternoons and Wednesday afternoons, when you and I are engaged on the Public Accounts Committee. So on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons I am involved in two Select Committees, and during the rest of the time I have to try to assimilate the information that has come my way on the subjects being investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all right for the Minister to come along here. He has the backing of the Civil Service. He can afford to engage in this kind of activity, though he himself has very little time to read. He can read out his brief and get away with it here, and if he is in difficulty a slip of paper is handed down to him and he reads the damn thing out and we cannot challenge him. We are in no position to challenge the comings and goings between him and the Civil Service, and it becomes much worse when the Committee sits in the afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we sit on Tuesday afternoon, for example, something may have been said on Tuesday morning that needs to be challenged, but there is no record of it. The Minister, or some other hon Member who might be challenged, can deny what he said on the Tuesday morning. A member of the Committee may say to him: "You said this this morning". He can reply: "No I didn't". Then the hon Member can say: "Yes, you did", and so it goes on. No record of what went on in the Tuesday morning sitting is available to us by the Tuesday afternoon. That is one of the difficulties
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
that arises when we have afternoon sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another one, and I will give just one example. If this Committee is to sit, in the afternoon, I have to choose between being here because I want to make a fairly long speech on the clause about local government extravagance—and it will not be about the Lothian region—and also want to attend the Procedure Committee. The Procedure Committee meets at 4 o'clock in private and 4.15 in public in Room 15 and the Clerk Assistant, Mr. Bradshaw, is giving evidence to us about how we handle Supply in the House, which is a very important subject. I also want to take part in the debate on the Floor of the House on poverty and the way the Government are demolishing the Welfare State and increasing the gap between the very wealthy in our society and the very poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how many hon Gentlemen saw "The Money Programme" last weekend which showed that the average increase in income last year of managing directors of companies was over 40 per cent., including top management in the media—	<i>The Daily Mail,</i> I think. These people are saying that ordinary workers must be satisfied with 6 per cent, whilst they are feathering their nests with an average of 40 per cent, and some of them over 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are facts that must be put on record on the Floor of the House at the same time and in contradistinction to what the Government are doing in stopping the building of sheltered housing in Glenrothes and East Kilbride and elsewhere. That is the sort of difficulty that this kind of timetable motion puts hon Members in. It is an intolerable situation where one wants to be in three places at once. Whenever we have afternoon sittings, this is the dilemma, the impossible dilemma, in which hon Members are placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been made that it is not as if this measure was desperately urgent, desperately needed by people in Scotland, they are not yearning for it to get on the statute book. I do not suppose the Government could count on two hands the number of Scots who want this Bill, not even members of their own party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to keep the quorum here. I see that if the Opposition walked out the sitting would have to be suspended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Tryit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are so conscientious that we prefer to do our job. I want to do my job here. I would not dream of going out, even to reduce the number present to below the quorum. This is the measure of our conscientiousness. There is an hon Member walking in now; at least my hon Friend the Member for South Ayshire (Mr. Foulkes) cannot keep out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this motion is passed I will see to it that my hon Friends walk out and Conservative Members will be kept in their seats. Even although they just sit on their backsides saying nothing they will have to attend because we are not going to keep the quorum for them to get a measure that is loathed by the great majority of people in Scotland. There is no mandate for it. This Bill was never mentioned in the Conservative manifesto, and even if it were they have no mandate in Scotland for anything that they are doing, for nothing at all. Let the Government not be under any illusion as to where they stand in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
I want to make one or two other points. A motion like this destroys the kind of congenial atmosphere that we have had in the Committee up to now. Although we object to the Bill, we, as good democrats, understand that the Government will eventually get their way; they will muster their votes. Even though hon Members opposite are silent in our debates, they know how to say "Aye" or "Noe" as the case may be, and that is enough for them. That, to them, is democracy; not debating, just voting and doing as the whip tells them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That atmosphere, that genial Sunday school tea-party atmosphere, is going to be destroyed. This Government have an obsession with confrontation politics. The Prime Minister herself is engaged in teaching people a lesson. Whether it be the trade unions, the one-parent families or the disabled, they must all be taught a lesson. It is infectious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office is now to teach us a lesson. If this motion passes, the genial atmosphere which we have all liked will be destroyed almost overnight. I doubt whether more progress will be made with the Bill as a result of having afternoon sittings. This is the great fallacy of afternoon sittings. The Government presumes that they can wear us down. I know my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) is not in the best of health, but he is gritting his teeth and is determined to oppose this Bill even if he drops down dead in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it would be quite unreasonable of me to drop down dead in the middle of the Session. There would have to be a by-election and that would be very inconvenient right now. I am sure my hon Friend will accept that I am prepared to grit my teeth and suffer fearfully, but I am not prepared to drop down dead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be quite without precedent for someone to drop down dead in the Committee. One may become seriously ill, but the process of dying always takes place elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to recall an incident where a member of the Scottish Grand Committee actually did drop down dead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to see the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Alex Anderson, who used to be the Member for Motherwell—he was an ex-schoolmaster and a very able Member—fell dead in the Scottish Committee through over-work. It was recorded that he died on the way to hospital. That is the myth and the humbug of this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In fact, for the record, Mr. Anderson died on the way to hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all saw what happened. I should not like that to happen to my hon Friend. He is a dear friend of mine and he must not be overworked in this Committee on Tuesday mornings, Tuesday afternoons, Thursday mornings, and Thursday afternoons, and in
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. If he were paid by the hour he would not have labourer's wages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon Friend tell us if the previous example of someone being taken seriously ill followed a timetable motion like this being introduced by the then Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think not. My recollection is that Alex Anderson was getting on in years, and he was working long hours, as we normally do—we accept that as part of our job. This brings out the need to emphasise that if one adds more hours to that burden it does not lead to intelligent debate. The Government are engaged in the process of wearing us down. We are not going to discuss the merits of the Bill at all. Hon Members opposite will sit back at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and when 7 o'clock comes they will be thinking of their dinner. I do not care whether I have any dinner or not. Any sacrifice is worthwhile to stop the Government doing the dirty work they are engaged in permanently, every day and every night. Hon Members opposite want their dinner at 7 o'clock at night, but we will go on. We will not be worn down by these tactics, by the confrontation politics we are now facing right along the line in every Government Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to think again, to make some kind of compromise gesture and accept the amendment. Let us see how we get on on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Thursday afternoons. That is not an extravagant compromise. I hope the Minister will accept it. If he does not, it is quite clear he is determined to thrust this Bill down our throats and the throats of the Scottish people. Nobody wants it. There is no great hurry for it. There is no legislative backlog as far as I know. In fact, the Government went out of their way at the outset of the Session to say that the legislative programme would be light. What is the hurry? There is the Education (Scotland) Bill and that is about all we have this Session so far as the Scottish Office is concerned, as I understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Session is young. There is absolutely no need for this Bill at all, except that the Government want to put the boot in to the local authorities before the financial year comes to an end. That is the main purpose. It has nothing whatever to do with Parliament. It has nothing to do with us. It is to do with the local authorities. The Government want to put the boot into the Lothian regional council. That is the sum and substance of the Bill. We do not intend to co-operate in that exercise in any way whatever. We think that Lothian council has a damned good record and we shall defend it and use every opportunity in subsequent progress on the Bill to defend it and attack the gross waste and extravagance of some Tory councils which have never been mentioned by Conservative Members. They will probably wish they had never raised the subject of Lothian by the time we have finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give them the promise—not a threat—that we must have time. From that point of view the Government are probably unwise to produce this motion. It is another good reason why they should drop it. But they will not drop it, and therefore I hope to go some way at least to showing that we are not as confrontation-minded as the Prime Minister. We are not obsessed with this determination to put the boot into everybody

who stands in our way, we are prepared to carry them along as far as we can. In that spirit I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon Gentleman is moving a manuscript amendment. In order that everything is clear, may I run through the procedure? We are discussing the motion
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the further proceedings on the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock."</p></blockquote>
The amendment moved by the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is to leave out from "meet on" to end and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Four o'clock."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Shaw. That is exactly what I wanted to propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick and East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to you, Mr Shaw, for clarifying what the Committee is dealing with. I came in when my hon Friend for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) was in full flow and I followed his speech with great interest. It was a splendid speech. But I was under the illusion that the Committee was dealing with amendment No. 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is almost a reflection on the Chair for not having checked the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire earlier. None the less, I am glad the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) knows what we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure you will accept, Mr. Shaw, that the Committee was in some difficulty. I gather that we are dealing with a manuscript motion, but it is so manuscript that it is not available to members of the Committee. I went round the various tables where documents are available and there was no copy of the motion available to members of the Committee, which seems to be rather a curious state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now my hon Friend for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) has gone on to move a manuscript amendment. How on earth could he move a manuscript amendment when it was physically impossible for him to write anything down and commit it to paper? We seem to have an entirely new phenomenon in the Committee: We have something which is neither a formally-tabled amendment nor a manuscript amendment, but a verbal amendment which has been selected by you, Mr. Shaw. That is a splendid innovation and I am sure that many of my hon Friends will take advantage of this new procedure which appears to have been implemented in future months and years both in this Committee and elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend will be aware that he can seek to move another manuscript amendment. If he does not like to sit on Tuesday afternoons he might not like to sit on Thursday afternoons either, or he might not want to sit at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to suggest a Sunday sitting but I do not know whether that would be in order or feasible. My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central has anticipated what I had in mind. Like a number of hon Members on the Opposition side. I am particularly worried about the idea of afternoon sittings on Thursdays. I suspect that in their heart of hearts Conservative Members share our concern, for reasons which I will briefly go into presently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend has moved his verbal manuscript amendment which would enable the Committee to sit on Tuesday afternoons. I can understand his reason for doing that because he is a distinguished member of the Public Accounts Committee and other Committees and would find it extremely difficult to be in two places at once. My hon Friend has a number of amazing qualities but the ability to be in two Committees and to give his full attention to two arguments and two sets of papers at once is stretching even him. I fully understand that, but I want to take this opportunity to move a second manuscript amendment which would delete the references to Thursday sittings in the motion, which would make it possible for the Committee to sit on Tuesday afternoons but not Thursday afternoons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I could be of help to the Committee and to the hon Gentleman. The hon Gentleman must not be surprised if from time to time he learns of things that he did not know before. It is perfectly possible for the Chair to accept verbal amendments. I hasten to add that it may not always do so. We have already got an amendment before us, moved by the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). The hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) now seeks to move another amendment. I am afraid that during this debate that is not possible. If this debate runs its full course and eventually comes to an end and 'there is a decision, it is possible that the Chair will accept another amendment to the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to say, however—and this is not anticipating anything but merely looking at the way things might go—that should there by any chance be a closure motion and should, by chance, the closure motion be accepted, and should, by chance, the decision be taken, it will not then be possible to take another amendment. Is the 'position now clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is now crystal clear. I should add that the situation is not a very happy one from the point of view of a number of members of the Committee, who are in grave difficulties as to how to vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Shaw, to clarify my mind, although some of my hon Friends and I have a great deal of sympathy with the manuscript amendment of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) and would certainly see it as an improvement on the substantive motion, I think there would be a body of opinion in the Committee which would prefer the manuscript amendment which cannot at this moment be put on .the Table because the Table is already
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
cluttered by the amendment moved by my hon Friend -the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like your guidance on whether there is any way in which we can guarantee, perhaps not an extensive debate because we do not wish to try your patience or that of the Committee, but at least a vote on the manuscript amendment which is not before the Committee but which we would like to get before the Committe. If, for example, at the end of the speech made by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) we voted upon the manuscript amendment of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central, it would then presumably be competent immediately to put formally upon the Table the putative manuscript amendment which has been mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this is hypothetical and that I cannot ask you, Mr. Shaw, to answer in absolute terms a hypothetical question, but presumably if that vote took place immediately after the speech which is presently in progress there could be no possibility of a closure choking off further debate and a vote upon the amendment which we are anxious to see formally before the Committee. Could you help me on that, Mr. Shaw?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always very dangerous to assume hypothetical situations. But—to follow the thoughts of the hon Member—I point out that when the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian sits down, it may well be that others may wish to intervene in the debate. Then there is no question of a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the assumption that they do not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Committee and not for the Chair. Such matters are entirely hypothetical. I can only rule on those matters that occur. But I think that the wit and sagacity of the hon Member is leading him along a certain path and it seems to me that it is entirely a question of whether he is capable of persuading others to accede to his views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Shaw. I realise that I am in no position to speak for my hon Friends. Many people in my position have sadly anticipated that they were so doing and have been proved wrong. So I make no such assumption. But, on the presupposition that nobody rose immediately following my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian, at that point presumably the amendment in the name of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central would be put and voted upon, if people were so minded. Then presumably another manuscript amendment could be accepted for debate and the general debate would be on that. If it was not so accepted for debate, presumably a clause stand part debate would then ensue. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman must have the courage of his own convictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Shaw, for future clarification of the position. We have the amendments to the Bill but we do not have on the amendment paper the sittings motion although it is recorded in the report of the last sitting of the Committee. When I asked you this morning, Mr. Shaw, whether it would be in order for us to have manuscript amendments because we did not see a motion on the amendment paper, with respect, did you not mislead us saying that manuscript amendments were not in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that I said that there might have been some misunderstanding. I took advice on this matter and at that stage I felt that the advice I had given might have led to some misunderstanding. I said that later on and that is why I made my announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Shaw. We were under a misunderstanding. I am trying to clarify whether it would have been in order for us at the beginning of the proceedings this morning to have introduced simultaneously or consecutively two manuscript amendments which would have had the effect of deleting reference to Tuesday or Thursday. Would it have been in order this morning at the beginning of the proceedings for two manuscript amendments to have been laid before the Committee by anyone who sought to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member has been listening carefully to the discussion that has taken place with the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). The same position has now been arrived at as would have happened earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Shaw, I seek your guidance. When I moved my manuscript amendment, it was a selfish personal move because it would suit me particularly this afternoon when I want to be in two other places apart from this. Therefore, I wonder whether I can help my hon Friends? I am anxious to take them along with me. I understand that they might prefer that we do not sit on Thursday rather than Tuesday. If it would help, with the permission of the Committee, I should be quite happy to seek leave to withdraw my amendment. In that case, would it be possible for my hon. Friend then to move that we do not sit on Thursday afternoons? The debate can then proceed on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: understand that the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Robertson) has finished his speech. If he has, there is an opportunity for the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) to seek to withdraw his amendment. That would finish the debate on that amendment, and then I might catch the eye of the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian once again for a second speech which may have a strong resemblance to a continuance of his first one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a feat of great ingenuity that I am moving this amendment, seeing that I do not really know what I am amending, not having seen the original motion. I am advised that the effect of this amendment would be to enable the Committee to meet on Tuesday afternoons. It is a major compromise being offered by this side of the Committee which would preserve us from Thursday afternoon sittings. While I understand the strong feelings of my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) about Tuesday afternoon sittings, I make no bones about the fact that I am a great deal more concerned about the idea of Thursday afternoon sittings. I do not wish to go over ground which my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) has already covered in considerable detail about the serious travelling problems which Thursday afternoon sittings would create for hon Members whose constituencies and homes are in Scotland, or a long way from Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) rightly concentrated on the constituency problems which would be created, and the problems which travel on Thursday night—whether in sleepers or otherwise—creates for hon Members who are trying to carry out their constituency and political duties, and their duties in respect of trade unions, local authorities and employers within their constituencies. It is only right that one should also refer to the family problems which this would create for a number of hon Members. I have considerable altercations—I will put it no stronger than that— with my wife when I have to travel on a sleeper and arrive home in a crabbit state on Friday morning, and I feel all the more crabbit because the only way that I can get a wink of sleep in one of British Rail's excellent sleepers is by taking sleeping pills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it ought to be considered whether it is good for the image of the House for Scottish Members to arrive back in Edinburgh or in their constituencies to carry out public engagements, and to have to face up to what their families have to say to them, in a drugged state. This is a point that is seriously made and I am sure that hon Members on both sides of the Committee are aware of the problems to which I am referring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I think it would be a suitable and acceptable compromise if we were to agree to meet on Tuesday afternoons but to allow hon Members, particularly those of us who live in Scotland, to get home on Thursday evening instead of travelling in a thoroughly uncivilised manner through the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
Having dealt briefly with my own amendment, Mr. Shaw, I think it would be only right to say a word while I am on my feet about the main motion. I hope that will be in order. I agree with my hon Friends who have mentioned that we have made excellent progress on this Committee. We have dealt with 12 clauses in what was in effect only six sittings, because the First Sitting did not really happen. I think it would be fair to say that the productivity record of the Committee is probably better than that of a number of the firms in which hon Gentlemen opposite are themselves involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not understand what the Minister is complaining about and why he feels it necessary to bring in a bulldozer at this stage of the proceedings of the Committee. It is unnecessary and there is no reason why the Committee should not continue to make progress, as it has been doing up to now, if we continue with morning sittings. Some of us feel extremely strongly about the likely, indeed certain, effects of the draconian provisions included in the Bill—effects on local authorities and on the people they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to refer to the urgent need to give proper consideration to the remaining items that we are going to have to debate on the Bill, the remaining clauses and schedules and of course, the new clauses, two of which stand in my name. I wonder whether it will be possible to give these remaining provisions proper consideration if at this early stage the Government come forward with a sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, Mr. Shaw, when you were dealing with points of order, you referred to hypothetical situations. I am a little worried about the possibility that a hypothetical situation could be developing between my hon Friend the Member for Dumbartonshire, Central (Mr. McCartney) and the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton). There seems to have been a great deal of scurrying around below the Bar and it seems quite possible that the Government are attempting to make really indecent haste about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have important things to consider properly in due course. We have things like the Methylated Spirits (Sale by Retail) (Scotland) Act 1937, and other items in schedule 2. We have the Highways (Provision of Cattle-Grids) Act 1950 and the Burial Grounds (Scotland) Act 1855 to talk about. Does the hon Member for Edinburgh, South Mr. Ancram) want to intervene? I thought we might be going to hear from him for a moment there by a happy coincidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one wants to hear from the hon Gentleman, one has to read a newspaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon Friend for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) said, if we want to hear from the hon Member for Edinburgh, South, we have to read the Edinburgh 	<i>Evening News.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important items in schedule 2 of the Bill which are going to require proper consideration. The Government are displaying quite unreasonable and unjustifiable impatience in bringing forward the sittings motion today and forcing us to waste a certain amount of time, as we are doing, at this stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend agree that when he used the phrase "wasting a certain amount of time",
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
what he meant was not any criticism of the pertinency and relevancy of the arguments but to a waste of time in the narrow and very proper sense that those arguments are dealing with a motion which is totally unnecessary? Would he not agree that there is a great danger that motions of the kind we are presently discussing are counter-productive—and perhaps the Minister would like to consider this—because there is a kind of Parliamentary equivalent of Parkinson's Law which says that if we expand the number of sittings the number of amendments is expanded to fill those sittings. There is a serious point in saying that we might make quicker progress to an earlier completion date of the Bill if we do not have this motion foisted upon us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is quite right. When I was referring to time-wasting, I was referring in particular—and it would probably be pertinent to draw attention to this—to some of the antics of the Minister in earlier sittings of the Committee where he sought to intervene on pretty trivial points and wasted a certain amount of time himself. It is particularly unjustifiable for the Minister, having indulged in such debating points, to bring in the bludgeon at this stage of our considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was attempting to draw my comments to a conclusion when my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) intervened. I am glad he intervened. He made an important point. Perhaps something I had said earlier could have given rise to misunderstanding, and I am grateful to him for ensuring that that misunderstanding did not continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way to my hon Friend. The last thing I want to do is to prolong this discussion, Mr. Shaw, particularly in view of the assistance you have given us and the assistance given us by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central, by withdrawing his earlier amendment.

Since when an amendment has been moved, namely, leave out from "meet on" and insert

At one time my election agent suggested that an appropriate slogan for the election might be "For Foulkes' sake vote Labour". Very wisely we did not take up that particular slogan, or I might not be here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise in support of the amendment moved by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), which I think is a reasonable com
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
promise, and I would argue seriously that the Minister should consider it. First of all, I sincerely apologise to you, Mr. Shaw, and to the Committee for not being here at 10.30. I had some travel problems, which illustrate the point raised by my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire East (Mr. Hogg). The train which left Ayr station on time at six minutes to midnight last night arrived at Euston station two and a half hours late this morning. That meant that I was not able to be with you in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It illustrates the problem that Scottish Members face in getting here and getting back to our constituencies. If I had been here in time, and if we had not had the sittings motion, the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian would have been quite right. We would have been able to continue on the main substantive topic that I was developing in the last sitting. That topic is very important, and I hope that, once we have all this procedural business over and done with, we shall be able to return to it. Over the week-end much of what I said on Thursday was substantiated, underscored and accentuated by the leader of the Labour group on Tayside regional council. Today I have further information which I shall be able to bring to the notice of the Committee at a later stage. It will prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that one local authority is about to break the law in a number of areas. I look forward to getting on to that subject as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making any party points, any points for publicity of any time-wasting points, but I am making a point directly to the Under-Secretary of State. I was going to call him my hon Friend but the traditions of the House say that I should not. We are from time to time friendly. I make the point in a friendly spirit. The sittings motion—I did not have the opportunity of hearing him move it—theoretically gives the Committee more time to consider more carefully the sensible amendments that we have put down. There is an advantage in that. We all want to consider the amendments very carefully. We want to spend time on them. They are of great importance to local government in Scotland. They are of great importance to us, so we do want to spend time on them. Therefore there is an argument that we should have more time to discuss the important amendments put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many of my hon Friends have said, we have been making reasonable progress, as the whips on both sides will agree. I have had experience with our whip, my Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, Central (Mr. McCartney) on the Civil Aviation Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill. He is a very reasonable fellow and allows things to progress as appropriate, on the one hand allowing us to make our important political points, allowing us to put forward our reasoned and reasonable arguments, and on the other hand letting the Government accept that we are not unnecessarily time-wasting. But what is being suggested today by the Minister is really unfair because we have progressed very quickly; as my hon Friend has pointed out, in six sittings we have got through 12 clauses. We have been going, in terms of some other Bills, at a galloping pace. As my hon Friend said, some people outside the House may say that we have been going far too quickly through particular clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore quite wrong of the Minister at this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
stage to bring this kind of sittings motion, but he has done it. We have to take account of the fact that he has a slight numerical majority on his side. Therefore I ask him in all seriousness, in the spirit of the discussions that have been taking place, whether he really wants to force us, a Scottish Committee, to sit on Thursday afternoons, with all that that involves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friends have already enumerated the other kinds of important activity that we have to carry out in the House. I understand that before I came in my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) spoke about the meetings that are being arranged on the Canadian Constitution, a very vital matter, in which each individual Member of the House will play a part. Decisions about it will not be easy because there happens to be a party policy. It will be a very difficult subject and we shall have to spend a great deal of time discussing it. That is just one issue on which we have to spend some time on Thursday afternoons and indeed at other times, which times are so little for those of us who represent Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thursday afternoon is a time when we have a number of meetings, when people like to get the plane back to Scotland, when people like to prepare for the weekend. People sometimes like to get back to Scotland on a Thursday to carry out some activity. The Minister is being wholly unreasonable in saying that we should meet on Thursday afternoons as well as on Tuesday afternoons. If we had been filibustering in the previous meetings one might understand it, but we have not. The hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord Douglas-Hamilton) smiled gently, as he always smiles, when I made that point, but very often it has been the Minister who has kept going longer than anyone else. In my last speech, when I was trying to get through it as quickly as possible, he interrupted on three occasions. It enlivened the debate, but it prolonged the proceedings. There has not been filibustering. There has been careful examination. There have been probing amendments. There have been amendments which have elicited some important points, one or two of which the Minister has conceded and has said he will introduce a Government amendment to take account of. I understand from the academics who tell us about the procedure of the House of Commons that the Committee procedure is important to the House for doing this very kind of thing. We need to get the balance over the amount of time that is available, and to do our job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the hon Gentleman is saying that we need more time to examine the Bill, but we do not need more time to examine it because of any delaying tactics or because of any filibustering by the Opposition. Therefore I ask him in all seriousness, having heard the debate, to consider the point raised by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian and to say that, while the Government were hoping to push the Committee into meeting on Tuesday afternoons and on Thursday afternoons, in the light of the reasoned and reasonable arguments that have been put forward— not at great length, because I have heard many longer speeches on sittings motions—he will accept the amendment. Then we can go straight on to discuss the matter that was before us, namely, amendment No. 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to a good deal of the debate. I missed the odd minute but I think I have heard most of the principal arguments that have been advanced. Almost by definition, debates upon timetable motions tend to be a little arid and predictable. Sometimes it is ritual sparring between Government and Opposition and in one's heart of hearts one feels sometimes, that, as the Government have a duty to manage the House and get their business, we can hardly complain about a timetable motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I say to the Minister in all seriousness that that is not my view this morning. I do not want to labour the point and I do not want to repeat 	<i>ad longem</i> what has already been said. But I believe that we have made reasonable progress on the Bill up to this point. We shall certainly have a substantial number of lengthy debates on clause 13, but I think the Minister would be the first to accept that clause 13 is the crux of the Bill, the centre of controversy. There is no reason to think that the pace at which we made very good progress through part I—and there can be no argument about that—would not pick up again when we came to the less controversial matters in the later clauses. I expect a fairly lengthy stop over clause 23. Apart from that I will not say that we should make short work, because there must be adequate and proper scrutiny but certainly there will be nothing more sinister than that when we come to the schedules and the non-controversial provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving his motion, the Minister is being over-zealous about his duties and obligations to get the Government's business. Without wishing to be pompous, I think that one of the traditions of this House is the protection of minority interests and, unfortunately, the Labour Party—as all Oppositions must be—is a minority interest. We obviously hope that that will be a temporary situation, but only the electorate can answer that question, but it is at present clearly hypothetical and I do not invite the Committee to dwell on it. We deal with the practical realities and at the moment the Labour Party is in a minority in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is important that we should not be asked to rush through what is, from the point of view of my party, a very controversial matter. I am sure the Minister will accept that. We have had very strong and tough representations from our friends in local government. The Minister will not forget that we represent the vast majority of local authorities in Scotland. The Government are initiating legislation which is backed only by a rump of public opinion in Scotland and only a small proportion of elected members at any level of government. It seems to me that we have a particular duty to do our job properly and not to have ourselves corsetted and "cabined, cribbed, confined" by a timetable motion of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that at the last election we heard from the Conservatives much talk about the pressure of legislation and how Governments in the last few years had been turning out legislation as though upon a sausage machine. There was almost a Nixonian ring about some of the slogans of Conservative candidates at the last election. They seemed almost to be arguing along with the late—in the political sense—Richard Nixon that big government was bad government and what we needed was a rest from the bombardment of new legislation. In their first year, in Scottish terms—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
and I can only speak in that parochial way—we had an unprecedented mass of Bills passing through the House, and the fair-minded person might well wonder what was still to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important point. I could understand it if we were still in the machismo early days of an Administration where every Minister, to prove his virility, was having to force through his legislation at the double. I could then understand the anxiety of the Under-Secretary. But we are now in the second Session and we are in a situation where we know a good deal about the legislation that is to come. We have a very controversial Education (Scotland) Bill to come which will obviously take some time in Committee. But after that we have the subject of family violence, which is non-controversial. There may be detailed points about corroboration and so on, and I think the Minister is familiar with the arguments. But basically he will expect us to support his effort on that Bill and I think that, in broad terms, we shall. We have no wish to delay it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that, I do not know of any Scottish legislation of substance which is expected this Session. We have the Bill dealing with civic government, which is certainly non-contentious. The Committee will remember the re-writing of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892 and that would turn anyone on, if I may put it colloquially. But in any event we know from a written question that that Bill is not expected this Session, that the Ministers are reconciled—I think very wisely—to the fact that it will almost certainly be a delight and an excitement for some lucky Members of Parliament, of whom I fear I shall be one, in the next Session of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are being asked to force through this particular piece of legislation at a pace which seems to me quite unnecessary at this stage in order to create a very substantial void in terms of Scottish legislation later in the parliamentary year. I really cannot see any justification for that. The Minister may explain that I have overlooked some important part of the programme. If so, I should be glad to know what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there were other Bills to come forward— and the Government can always vary the weight of the legislative programme—we could in any event start a second Committee if we so wished. It is not uncommon to have two Scottish Standing Committees. If one looks back through the years, one will find that it is a very normal .procedure. With a little ingenuity, a second Scottish Standing Committee is certainly an option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, at the end of the day—and I do not talk in theory but in practice when I say that Members are of equal value—if the Minister cannot staff a second Scottish Standing Committee because he has not enough Scottish Back Benchers because of the very proper opposition to Tory policies in Scotland, there is no reason why he should not staff it with English Members who could serve on it perfectly properly in the same way as they do on the Scottish Grand Committee. As they sit like tailors' dummies hour after hour saying nothing, it would not matter if the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) was replaced by the hon Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
Yarmouth, or Folkestone, or Bournemouth, or Fylde, or any other English constituency. I think that a little cross-fertilisation across the border might be no bad thing. I do not want to go into this. I make the point that there is the option of a second Scottish Standing Committee if the Minister wishes to avail himself of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is no case in precedent at this early stage with the good progress which, in my view, we have been making. There is no case of impending disaster to the Minister on the Scottish programme, given how light it is at this session. I hope therefore that he will be prepared to look at this matter again. It is an important Bill. There is no doubt about that. I am sure that the Minister does not want to belittle his own measure. There is always a healthy debate on this side, and I do not entirely agree with some of the phrases used by my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), and I say that only as a matter of textual disagreement. I agree entirely with the spirit and thrust of his argument. He said that the Bill was tyrannical for some reason which I cannot quite explain. The words that struck me when I considered its powers were that they were excessive and unreasonable. In any event, that is perhaps a semantic point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend said that the Minister's attitudes were hysterical. I think that perhaps they are on occasion, but more often they are rather cold and calculated and, on this occasion, it seems to me that they show a disrespect for members of the Committee which is uncharacteristic of the hon Member and of Ministers in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a very real practical difficulty. I do not want to talk about travel, Mr. Shaw. We have made that point and it is solidly on the agenda for consideration before we take any votes. But we all know that there is a very considerable difference in approach to a Committee between members of the Opposition and those on the Government Benches. It is no disrespect to members on the Government Benches to say that they are not expected to say very much. They are certainly not expected to flood the Amendment Paper, as the Minister has done, with amendments. I find it remarkable that no fewer than 50 amendments and new clauses from the Minister have appeared on the Amendment Paper since last week. It suggests some rather slipshod work somewhere, but we shall no doubt discuss that at a later stage. Certainly no one would expect Back Benchers on the Government side to follow the Minister's example. I would be the last to urge that upon them. Therefore they are not likely to be manufacturing amendments preparing for debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on this side we have to bear the heat and burden of the argument; we have to represent the majority view in Scotland and we have a lot of work to do in trying to understand parts of the Bill. I have been looking at it myself this morning and I have come across one part at least which does not make sense grammatically and which I fear will need a great deal of amendment. We need to be able to consider and to draw breath, to do drafting, preparation and consultation between sittings in a way that quite clearly Government Back Benchers do not need to do. No doubt we will be in the same position as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
they are in when we are in power again, but now we must deal with the reality, with the position of the Opposition, which always has to be considered. I very much hope that the Minister will be prepared to consider it on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will vote against the sittings motion. There is no doubt about that, for the very adequate and eloquently-advanced reasons which we have heard during the course of the morning. But I urge the Minister to consider the amendment moved by my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) for the magnanimous way in which he withdrew his manuscript amendment, and put himself to some potential inconvenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that no extension of the sittings of the Committee is necessary at all. We have made that point in the clearest possible terms. But if we are prepared to give a concession—and I have some doubts about whether we should make a concession— the proper concession, quite clearly, is that there should be sittings at 4.30 on Tuesdays and not on Thursdays. That gives a considerable extension of time to the Minister, which is adjustable, because it may be another sitting of two and a half hours, ending at 7 o'clock, but if 	<i>in extremis</i> we are not going well, or if he thinks according to his rather arbitrary and ill-considered views that sufficient progress is not being made, he can adjust that sitting as he thinks fit. The important point is that we are all here on Tuesday, and if it is essential to have more time I think Tuesday is the appropriate day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend reflect for a second on the fact that some of us are not here on Tuesday, and indeed it appears that the train from Aberdeen has only just arrived?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
But to get back to the point. The amendment is a sensible one, and I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept it. Tuesday makes a lot of sense. It gives him the flexibility he seeks; it gives him the ability to manipulate the amount of time taken to consider the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:As I have indicated to the hon Gentleman, if the sittings motion is approved by the Committee of course the Government will be prepared to consider the situation with regard to any particular afternoon sitting on either a Tuesday or a Thursday, when there is some particular reason why it would be inappropriate to sit on that day. We are quite prepared to be flexible and I hope the hon Gentleman will enable the Committee to come to a decision on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that is some sort of olive branch, or a pipe of peace, if I can mix metaphors, from the Government. But it is not satisfactory, as I am sure the Minister will accept. It would be much more satisfactory just to accept that we should have Thursday sittings in the mornings only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refresh my hon Friend's memory? He was out of the room when I raised the specific point of a piece of Scottish legislation which could well come up. The undertaking given by the Minister on that occasion, when I put it to him, was that the Government would have to see how things were—that, to put it bluntly, they would look for concessions, they would be trying to twist our arms and trying to indulge in procedural blackmail. I think my hon Friend who was not present at that time, should be made aware of the Minister's train of thought in that respect. It is not in keeping with the statement he made a few moments ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will reconsider it. I hope that he will reconsider this whole unfortunate motion. I should like to stress the point that these things can be counterproductive. I refer again to the Parliamentary equivalent of Parkinson's Law. I can assure the Minister that I am endlessly ingenious in the manufacture of amendments—as are many of my hon Friends—and we have been remarkably restrained and moderate so far. If we have this motion foisted upon us, I am not sure that it will save any time on the completion date of this Bill. It will make life up to that date a great deal less comfortable. If that is the way the Minister wants to play it, I am afraid there is absolutely no option but to settle in to siege warfare in this Committee, which none of us wants. We would much prefer Tuesdays only, if the Minister insists on something, and that we proceed in a reasonably dignified way discussing the genuinely important points that emerge in this particular legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
