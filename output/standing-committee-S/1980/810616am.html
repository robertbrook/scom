	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 7, line 17, leave out

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a pairing of amendments in which I am joined by my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). He has put down in some ways a much more specific and therefore more interesting amendment, because he attempts to leave out paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> of subsection (4), while I have merely put down a probing amendment to take out both paragraphs 	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(c)</i>.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an area in which an exclusion order has been granted. The clause provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In making an exclusion order the court shall"—</p></blockquote>
and that, of course, is non-discretionary, at least on the face of it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the application of the applicant spouse,—
	<ol>
	<li>grant a warrant for the summary ejection …</li>
	<li>grant an interdict prohibiting … entering the matrimonial home …</li>
	<li>grant an interdict prohibiting the removal by the non-applicant spouse … of any furniture and plenishings".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
There is at the end, as anyone with two eyes can see, an important qualification to that non-discretionary state, because it goes on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless, in relation to paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> or 	<i>(c)</i> above, the non-applicant spouse satisfies the court that it is unnecessary for it to grant such a remedy."</p></blockquote>
I should like to hear a little from the Minister about why there should be that get-out, that element of discretion, for the court in the granting of a warrant for summary ejection and interdict for removing furniture and plenishings, but an apparent automatic interdict prohibiting the spouse from entering the matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see some logic in the sense that we are saying that if there is an exclusion order, where the applicant has met the criteria set down in subsection (2), by definition it can be argued that there is a danger at least of the applicant spouse being molested and, on application, therefore, 	<i>(b)</i> should be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire will no doubt put a counter point of view, but I can see the argument that summary ejection is a particularly wounding and peremptory process. It may be that a non-applicant spouse would be able to persuade the court that it was not necessary on the grounds perhaps that he was in any event leaving or had left during the course of the processes and since the action for the exclusion order had been started. It is worth probing because, clearly, there are different levels here and the various paragraphs are being dealt with on a different basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that brief introduction, I shall listen with interest to my hon. Friend and the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak to amendment No. 156, to leave out "	<i>(a)</i> or". It seems to be giving concern to some people that the court may be given too much discretion because the non-applicant spouse may be able to argue that it is unnecessary for the court to grant the remedy in paragraph 	<i>(a)</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a warrant for the summary ejection of the non-applicant spouse from the matrimonial home".</p></blockquote>
I can see the point, which I think is a fairly reasonable one, that the non-applicant spouse ought to be able to argue against the granting of an interdict as far as the removal of furniture, fittings and so on from the house is concerned, but paragraph (a) refers to summary ejection. I think that there is the fear that unless amendment No. 156 is accepted, in cases where the applicant spouse is the female and the non-applicant spouse is the male, the wife may be subjected to some form of intimidation as a result of the wording of the clause as it stands. There is a fear that it may be possible for a man, who is still in the house, to persuade the court that a summary ejection is not necessary because he will leave of his own accord in a week's time, for example, when other housing will be available. He may plead that in the meantime he will not harm the woman if the court allows him simply to stay in the house for another week or until he gets alternative accommodation. There is a fear amongst some women and voluntary organisations with experience of these cases that this would leave the woman open to intimidation and the possibility
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
of continued violence by the man. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister would reply on these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments refer to clause 4 and deal with the procedure that will follow once an exclusion order has been granted by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as clause 	<i>4(4)(b)</i> is concerned—the granting of an interdict—it is certainly the view of the Government that it is almost inconceivable, where an exclusion order has been granted, that it would not be appropriate to grant an order for interdict at the same time. Otherwise, the whole force of the exclusion order would be severely jeopardised. I find it impossible to conceive of a situation where one would be simultaneously considering that an exclusion order was appropriate but for some reason interdict was not. Therefore, it seems sensible to draft the clause in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 156, I fully appreciate the point raised by Women's Aid. It is concerned that a non-applicant spouse might give a convincing assurance which turned out not to be backed by the facts. I think that in practice that is covered by the discretion that is available to the court. The Bill is really saying that normally a warrant for summary ejection would follow. The onus would be upon the husband to satisfy the court that there were particular circumstances in the case in question where that would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an exclusion order were granted after the husband had already moved out of the house into some other property, it would be nonsense to get a formal warrant for summary ejection. Therefore, to make it a compulsory requirement of every exclusion order would bring that aspect of the Bill into disrepute as it would clearly be nonsense in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems more appropriate, taking into account the sort of situation that the hon. Gentleman has quite properly raised, to put the onus on any applicant who does not wish a warrant for somebody's ejection to be part of an exclusion order to satisfy the court as to the reasons for it. I have no doubt that the court would need some pretty strong evidence before it would be convinced that this was appropriate in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, the hon. Gentleman's amendment would not be appropriate, as it would allow the sort of nonsense that I have mentioned to arise, at least in a certain proportion of cases, and I am sure that would not be his intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 7, line 21, leave out paragraph 	<i>(a).</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 157, in page 7, line 22, after "area", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or areas, including an area".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 158, in clause 13, page 15, line 37, after "area" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or areas, including an area".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This again is a probing amendment, but it raises rather more widespread anxieties and doubts. As the Committee will see, the amendment proposes removing from the Bill subsection (5)(a). That paragraph is discretionary, but it allows a court to
	<br><blockquote><p>"grant an interdict prohibiting the non-applicant spouse from entering or remaining in a specified area in the vicinity of the matrimonial home".</p></blockquote>
I accept the good intention of the clause and recognise that the Government or their advisers have been trying to strike a balance. We have had representations, which are reflected in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). There has been some advice, particularly from Women's Aid, that this clause is too weak, though I take rather an opposite view. I recognise that there is real fear, particularly among women's organisations but much more widely than that, that if one does not have something on the lines of this provision, one may get conduct which does not amount to a breach of an interdict, which is meant to prevent molestation of the applicant-spouse, but conduct which can still be harrowing, difficult, embarrassing and humiliating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example commonly given is where a husband will turn up at some predetermined place— the schcol gates or outside the house— and stand there, perhaps in mute protest, not molesting in an active sense but perhaps even carrying some message to the general public about the moral character of his wife or the way that he has been treated by the courts. It would obviously be a reasonably unlikely situation, but I accept that it is one which we have to take seriously, and I presume that this paragraph is supposed to deal with such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 157 suggests—and there is some virtue in this, I suppose, if we are going down this road at all—that we might make it not just a specified area in the vicinity of the matrimonial home but
	<br><blockquote><p>"areas, including an area in the vicinity of the matrimonial home".</p></blockquote>
This would allow it presumably to be not just an area around the house, but round the school or perhaps the woman's place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). If we are to do this and widen the possibilities, we should go to the logical conclusion and say that this kind of conduct could occur anywhere, and welcome the flexibility that he is attempting to write into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess, however, that I am worried about it. If we have an interdict—and, after all, it is a non-discretionary interdict—preventing the non-applicant spouse from molesting the other spouse, that in itself should be sufficient protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can say only that there are substantial difficulties in inviting the courts to consider the proposition that in the town in which the non-applicant spouse will continue to live, one should create what I can only describe—to borrow a term from a very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0984">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
different scene—as "no-go" areas. There should be a map. In my part of the country we have been looking at maps in the past 24 hours with great attention. There are some grounds for exclusion orders, if I may say so, in the logic of the maps that we have been looking at. It is not fair to invite the courts to draw a map with areas in which, by definition, a non-applicant spouse, whatever his business may be, should not be allowed to go. That is the possibility opened up by this paragraph. There may be a hundred reasons, in terms of his job or his social life, which are unconnected with the applicant spouse. He may want to go to Smith Street, or within a quarter of a mile of such-and-such a house, or, if my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire has his way, such-and-such a school or office block.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, as regards the kind of conduct which was so oppressive, even if it did not amount to assault or the laying on of hands, it should be possible to construct the original interdict granted by the court in such a way as to deal with any likely outbreak of even passive behaviour, such as picketing, which presumably is what people are thinking about, on the part of the non-applicant spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Others may wish to comment on this matter. If so, perhaps we can come back to it. My preliminary view, subject to what the Minister says, diverges, not for the only time, from that of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire. Despite the logic of his amendment, given that this power is in the Bill at all, the safe way would be not to go further down the road but not to start out on this journey at all. We should leave the protection to an original interdict granted by the court in terms of non-molestation instead of inviting the court to draw up a defensible space into which the non-applicant spouse must not trespass, however innocent his intentions and however necessary his business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer briefly to amendments Nos. 157 and 158. The drafters of the Bill are assuming that, if the interdict simply prohibits the non-applicant spouse from entering or remaining in a specified area near the matrimonial home, that of itself will guarantee the other spouse freedom from intimidation. I am not so sure about that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said, we can all envisage cases—and I am assured by those who have experience of these matters that there have been such cases—of women being intimidated by their husbands, not necessarily in the matrimonial home or in the vicinity of the matrimonial home, but, for example, in the vicinity of the place of work or the school. Even if an interdict is made prohibiting the husband from going near the matrimonial home, he will usually know where the woman works and where the children go to school. He may know the daily routine of the wife and children and be able to follow them around. This would present an opportunity for intimidation. Indeed, it may well reach a stage where the woman may feel obliged to change her place of work, or even feel pressurised into
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
changing the school or nursery to which the children go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to consider these points not only as they relate to clause 4, but to clause 13, to which amendment No. 158 relates, which relates to matrimonial interdicts. The arguments there are much the same. Why should the specified area be simply round the matrimonial home? Why not leave it open for the court to specify other areas which may in fact be a considerable distance from the matrimonial home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may remember, Mr. Henderson, that several months ago I took up the issue of the right of all citizens to have freedom of movement. That centred round a football match, the date and details of which slip my memory. I was saying that in a free and open society we should have as few restrictions as possible on people's rights to go to any part of the country, any part of a town or any part of a street. We have to balance that against the rights of women who may well be molested. At the end of the day we must ask ourselves which is the greater right and which is the greater freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put restrictions on the rights of the subject to move unhindered about a town is, however little, an erosion of a basic freedom. The question of a woman being molested, hampered or annoyed by her husband could perhaps be more adequately dealt with by trying to get housing authorities to have a more flexible approach than they currently have, not by restricting the right of movement of an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we say that it does not matter that we restrict somebody's right on this issue, then we build up another picture. For example, who is to carry an identity card? Who is not to be allowed to go to this or that place? It is a dangerous road to take. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), that it would be better not to start down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) referred to the various maps at which he and his hon. Friends have been anxiously looking during the last 24 hours. If one were to make any reference to that matter in connection with the Bill, the provision dealing with grants for a warrant for the summary ejection of the individual concerned might be the most appropriate and relevant part of the Bill. I would not, however, wish to intrude on private grief in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden takes exception to the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the vicinity of the matrimonial home",</p></blockquote>
This amendment was specifically put in in another place to achieve what we feel is a proper balance: on the one hand, the protection of the wife from possible molestation by her husband and, on the other hand, the unreasonable infringement on the legitimate freedom of the husband or the non-applicant spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
if there has been an exclusion order excluding the husband from the house, then it is not unreasonable that, if the court feels it appropriate, there should also be the opportunity to extend that exclusion order to the immediate environs of the house. That is what is referred to by the use of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the vicinity of the matrimonial home".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, if one did not specify the words "in the vicinity", it would be open to the court to allow a much wider area of restriction than would otherwise be available. That, in essence, is what the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) seeks by his amendment, which would enable the court to allow many areas of a locality which the husband would normally frequent to be areas from which he would henceforth be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seem to be two basic objections to the approach of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire. First, it would be wrong, in the context of the Bill, to exclude a husband, for example, from his place of work. If he were working in an area where his wife also worked, it would be quite inappropriate to make that part of an exclusion order from a matrimonial home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that, if there are special circumstances which justify a wife's fears that she may be molested by her husband in some other part of the town, there are already means available to her for getting the protection of the courts simply by seeking an interdict. Under existing law she can seek an interdict which—if the court agreed with her view— would prevent her husband from attending any particular part of the locality which the court agreed could lead to molestation of the wife. Therefore, there is the existing protection in the areas of possible threat to which the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill we are simply concerned with the matrimonial home. It is not unreasonable to think of the street outside the house as being relevant to an exclusion order from that house. There would be a clear risk of bother and possible physical molestation and certainly the creation of a sense of fear to the wife if the husband, although forbidden from entering the house, were to behave in an unacceptable way immediately outside the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on these grounds I would defend the existing wording of the clause. As the hon. Member for Garscadden rightly anticipated, the clause reflects a compromise between the legitimately competing claims as to the rights of the husband and the wife. This seems to be the most acceptable balance, given the dangers that would be inherent in either a narrower or a wider interpretation of this provision. There is no magical solution for any of these areas of policy, but I believe that the existing wording is the most suitable we are likely to attain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reading the clause again as the debate progresses, we have here the granting of an exclusion order which suspends occupancy rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
That is clear enough. On top of that the court can, and indeed "shall", on application,
	<br><blockquote><p>"grant a warrant for the summary ejection "—</p></blockquote>
that is clear—
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>(b)</i> grant an interdict prohibiting the non-applicant spouse from entering the matrimonial home without the express permission of the applicant;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) grant an interdict prohibiting the removal by the non-applicant spouse, except with the written consent".</p></blockquote>
Then we go on to what we are talking about, which is the interdict prohibiting
	<br><blockquote><p>"entering or remaining in a specified area".</p></blockquote>
There is nothing in the clause which allows an interdict from molesting the spouse as such. Presumably that has to be done under a later provision in clause 13. I wonder whether it would be better, if there is any fear of the kind of molestation about which we have been talking, to leave out paragraph 	<i>(a)</i> on the grounds that we are talking here merely about possession of the house under an occupancy order. If there is to be some sort of interdict to prevent conduct—which is nothing to do with occupancy but is to do with harassing the spouse in general terms—would it not be better for it to be dealt with under a matrimonial interdict, such as may be obtained under clause 13, which
	<br><blockquote><p>"refrains or prohibits any conduct of one spouse towards the other spouse or a child of the family "?</p></blockquote>
That is not specifically dealt with under clause 4 at all. It is perhaps a drafting point, but it seems to me to have some validity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one is granting an exclusion order excluding the husband from the matrimonial home, there is no way that he will be able to molest the wife in that home without breaking the original exclusion order and the interdict that goes with it. Implicit in an exclusion order and an interdict from entering the home is the prevention of molestation. The hon. Gentleman is quite correct that if one wishes to have a general prohibition on molestation of a wife, one can achieve that through a general interdict. But it seems to me that it is more convenient from everyone's point of view that, if, in the particular circumstances, the wife has her exclusion order, she has her interdict. If, instead of having to initiate a separate action to deal with what might happen immediately outside the house, the court can, at its own discretion, grant an interdict prohibiting the husband from the immediate vicinity of the area, from the administrative and procedural point of view that seems a far more sensible way to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that one could do this as a general request for an interdict raised at the same time as an exclusion order, but it seems unnecessarily complicated to require it to be two separate actions when, in the vast majority of cases, the discretion available under the Bill in its present form would be quite sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) feels about this matter, but I am not entirely happy.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
There seems to be something of a conflict here because the exclusion orders seems basically to deal with possession of the house and the interdicts are tailored to the general conduct of the spouse. It seems to me that clause 4 deals only with possession of the house, and the interdict is to prevent the other spouse going into the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are worried not just about possession of the house, but that he will bump her in the eye or molest her in some physical way, clearly an application at the same time would be made under clause 14, which specifically says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The court shall, on the application of the applicant spouse, attach a power of arrest—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) to any matrimonial interdict which is ancillary to an exclusion order".</p></blockquote>
Presumably one would apply for such an ancillary order to the exclusion order. That is where one deals with possible harassment—we were talking about picketing, mute protests of one sort or another —or, indeed, physical violence. It seems to me that that could be much better done under clauses 13 and 14. Therefore. I still hold to the view that subsection 	<i>(5)(a),</i> although I accept that it is a compromise, would be better left out of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister is not convinced. Perhaps we can all think further about it before Report. It is entirely a matter for my hon. Friend what he does, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a short point on the import of this clause as a whole. The anxiety that I expressed in broad outline on consideration of principle relates to clause 4(4) where, in two instances, an interdict can be granted imposing a prohibition upon the non-applicant spouse entering the matrimonial home and, secondly, prohibiting the removal by the non-applicant spouse of furniture and so on from the house. In both circumstances, this is qualified by the provision that this is to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"without the express permission of the applicant".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that this raises a potentially important point on the law of interdict in Scotland. Up to now the law has taken a firm view that the interdict must be clear, precise and tempered in circumstances that are beyond any question. But what causes me anxiety is that if two sets of circumstances are allowed for in this clause, whereby one of the spouses has, as it were, an interdict as a sword rather than a shield, in certain circumstances the wife will be in a position to say "You can come into the house on this occasion with my permission," or " You can come in and remove this item or furniture with my permission." But what concerns me is that, if one takes it a step further and looks to what happens when interdicts are breeched, the court then has to embark upon what is essentially a quasi-criminal investigation of what occurs. I should think that the courts will be reluctant to embark
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
on that process if the non-applicant spouse says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yes, certainly I entered the house on that occasion, but it was with the express consent of the person who holds the interdict."</p></blockquote>
It has been my experience that where interdicts have been used, as I have described it, as swords rather than shields, the court has generally been inclined to withdraw the interdict as a whole. What concerns me in this context is that the court is not in a position to say " If you use this interdict as a weapon in the battle between spouses, it will be withdrawn." It cannot do that under the clause, because, as the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) pointed out on consideration of principle, clause 4 is in peremptory terms. If the exclusion order is made at all, the court
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall, on the application of the applicant spouse " </p></blockquote>
grant the interdict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that we are moving into an area of change in the general law of interdict in Scotland. I ask the Minister to look at it again, because it is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) has a valid point. There is a genuine problem here. Clearly it would be unfortunate, particularly in a matrimonial situation, if the mere fact that an interdict had been granted prevented the husband from entering the house, even as part of an attempt at reconciliation which both were genuinely trying to initiate. Therefore, it seems sensible to allow some flexibility in this provision rather than the wife having to say to the husband "Yes, we shall have another go at it, but I cannot let you into the house until I have gone to the court and formally had the interdict lifted." That would be an unnecessarily rigid and inflexible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a genuine problem in the sense that the husband could use this as a bogus way of maintaining that his wife had given him permission. Clearly, the onus would be upon him to prove it. The mere fact that the wife had reported a breach of interdict and that the court was having to consider the matter would imply that it might be difficult for the husband to satisfy the court, unless there were some significant evidence to support the point. Certainly we shall look at those words again. The situation should not be such that, where there was a genuine agreement, the husband should not be allowed to enter the home because the technicalities of the interdict had made that impossible. Subject to that, we can certainly look at the overall picture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting point. Presumably an interdict that is gained in connection with an exclusion order is open-ended. It can be raised only by one of the parties going to the court and asking for a recall. If there were a reconciliation, that would have to be with consent, but it would not affect the running on of the interdict, and the husband or, more appropriately, the wife, if she were the holder of the interdict, would have to go to the court to ask for a recall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
We must face the fact that, as always when one tries to redress a balance—there was often a balance against the wife in property and other areas of the law—there is a considerable swing, as the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) said. Of course, there would always be a temptation for a wife to say "We will try a reconciliation, but I shall keep the interdict in being." If she does that, at any point she can withdraw her consent and the husband has to go. If he does not, he is in breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It worries me a little that the Minister says that the onus of proof will be on the husband. It is an onus that will in many cases be very difficult to discharge, unless he is approaching a reconciliation point or an arrangement about entering the house for a specific purpose, in an atmosphere of deep suspicion. He may say "Right, I shall bring along my Auntie Jeannie and my Uncle James so that you can say in their presence that you are consenting to this and I can use them as witnesses if you change your mind and go for a breach of interdict." That would be an unfortunate situation, but, if it is not done on that basis, it will be a one for one. If the onus of proof is on the husband, it will be almost impossible to discharge. He might find himself exercising the consent at some risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments are valid. It is, of course, the case that either party under clause 5 can go to the court and ask for the recall of the interdict. Certainly I have not seen it suggested that there should be a statutory onus on the husband. I was simply saying that the court would obviously want some clear indication that the wife had consented, if that was the nature of the husband's defence to a charge of breach of interdict. Certainly, some flexibility is the important objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My anxiety stems from the fact that, generally speaking, the granting of an interdict in the law of Scotland rests with the discretion of the court. In the circumstances here, once the court has taken the decision to grant an exclusion order, if an application is made, it is bound to grant an interdict under subsection 	<i>(4)(b)</i> or (c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will see that (c) is covered by a minimal amount of discretion, but the non-applicant spouse can satisfy the court that it is unnecessary for it to grant such a remedy. There is just that element in 	<i>(a)</i> and (c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 	<i>(b)</i> which is the more critical one. I should not like the court, because of its reluctance to be compelled to grant interdicts, to say that it will be far more hesitant about granting an exclusion order because, once it grants an exclusion order, it necessarily follows, if application is made, that it must grant the interdict. What causes me some concern is that, because of this opportunity for one spouse to use it as a sword, the court might go hick two stages and exhibit some reluctance to grant an exclusion order at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. I do not think that a court that was willing to accept the need to exclude the husband from the house to protect the wife would shrink from granting such an order because an interdict was part of such a package. I cannot conceive of a situation where it would make logical sense to exclude the husband, but feel it inappropriate to grant an interdict to prevent him going to the house. The only purpose of an interdict is the enforcement of the exclusion order. If one does not want to interdict him, then there is no point in having an exclusion order in the first place. The two are intertwined. My hon. Friend need not fear that the granting of an exclusion order would in any way be less likely because of its being applied in conjunction with an interdict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although amendment No. 64 is a purely drafting amendment, No. 162 is of considerable substance. The background to this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
amendment stems from the Government's decision not to adopt the matrimonial notice procedure which had been recommended by the Scottish Law Commission and which is perhaps the biggest single difference between the Bill and the Law Commission's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons why we chose not to exercise the matrimonial notice option are basically twofold. First, the Law Commission's view was that if a spouse had lodged a matrimonial notice which indicated her occupancy rights, then that should be an entirely overriding right which gave her total protection as regards occupancy of her home. There are many attractions in this approach, but I think the biggest single unattractive aspect is that it is unlikely that other than a relatively small minority of spouses would have taken advantage of such an opportunity, because of an unawareness of the opportunities existing under the law, but, more importantly, because spouses are unlikely to conceive of the need for such precautions as long as the marriage is working well. By the time the marriage has broken down, it might be too late to start thinking in terms of the lodging of a matrimonial notice. Therefore, it seems sensible and appropriate to have a wider-ranging provision, which will give a high level of protection to the vast majority of spouses, whether or not they have at an earlier date, when the marriage was working quite successfully, anticipated the problems that might arise in the event of marital breakdown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, therefore, was the main reason why the Government did not feel that the matrimonial notice approach was suitable. There are also the additional bureaucratic requirements that such a procedure would involve. It would involve very significant increases in staffing in the Department of Registers in terms of dealing with the lodging and processing of matrimonial notices. These and other implications which I mentioned earlier led the Government to conclude that a different approach, as outlined in the Bill, would be more suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, when it went to another place, had the form in which it exists at present, and we have been subjected to very strong representations, in particular from the building societies and the Law Society of Scotland, that in one important respect a further change should be made. They were greatly concerned that the Bill in its present form would not protect the position of a bona fide third party who had purchased the house and did not know of the existence of a spouse with occupancy rights, because the husband, on selling the house, failed to disclose the existence of such a person. The situation is quite different if the husband admits that he has a spouse, because in those circumstances, unless the spouse has expressly waived her occupancy rights, any person purchasing the house does so in the full knowledge that occupancy rights exist and might prevail over their own rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a situation, however, where a husband for fraudulent reasons has not disclosed the existence
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
of his wife, there is no set way in which a third party can discover whether a spouse exists. The spouse might be in residence in the house. Therefore, it would be obvious that she existed and had occupancy rights. But there may be circumstances where she was temporarily absent from the house, or for some other reason was not resident in the property in question. Therefore, there would be a danger that a third party, having purchased the house in good faith and taken up residence, some weeks, or indeed some months later—there is no specific time scale laid down—may suddenly hear a knock at the door and find a long-departed spouse reappearing and claiming her occupancy rights. The bona fide third party, who did not know that the spouse existed, might then find that the court, for various reasons, chose to allow that spouse to exercise her occupancy rights. Although the bona fide third party purchaser could not have his ownership of the property interfered with, he would find himself in the delightful, but no doubt undesirable, position of owning a house which he could not live in and having as his resident non-rent-paying tenant the spouse of the person from whom he purchased the house in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible, of course, for such a person to protect himself by insurance from the financial consequences of such a situation. We were impressed by the force of the argument that there was an objection in principle to a third party being put in this position, even if the financial implications could be covered by insurance. For this reason, we have tabled the amendment now before the Committee, which enables a bona fide third party to be satisfied that his occupancy as well as his ownership of the property is not in question in the circumstances set out in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission understandably still believes that its proposals for matrimonial notices would be the most satisfactory way of dealing with this whole issue. The Law Commission appreciates and understands the reasons why the Government have come to a different view, but it is right that its position should be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing from the Government's point of view is to ensure that the maximum number of spouses are enabled to benefit from these provisions. We believe that the procedure which will apply as a result of the amendment will give the maximum protection to the vast majority of spouses. The only spouses who would not be protected would be those in the extremely unlikely situation where the husband had deliberately concealed the existence of a spouse, and where a bona fide third party had purchased the property in that ignorance. In that situation one is forced to choose between the rights of the spouse and the rights of the bona fide third party. I think that the view of the Opposition, during our earlier discussions on the Bill, was that in these circumstances it was difficult to argue that the rights of the third party should not prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the non-entitled spouse would still have a civil remedy against the entitled spouse for any financial loss that had been suffered as a consequence of his fraud. Indeed, there may be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0989">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
circumstances in which his declaration that he was not married and had no spouse might amount to criminal conduct and thereby lay him open to the possibility of prosecution. These various factors are likely to lead to this provision being relevant in a tiny number of cases. Nevertheless, there was an important point of principle involved. For that reason, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right in saying that this is one of a rare group of amendments put down by the Government which is actually of importance and has some meaning, the other 315 being entirely placebos for their lordships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dispute the Government's decision not to proceed with the matrimonial notice suggestion. That option is now closed. However, I was delighted to hear the Minister rehearsing so eloquently the arguments we were using in connection with the waiver provisions when he pointed out that people would not use the matrimonial notice because they would not appreciate the necessity when the marriage was in good nick, and by the time the warning signals appeared it might well be too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Government have made their choice. They are going down the road set out in the Bill. The point is how to amend it to ensure that there is no possibility of abuse and no insurmountable conveyancing difficulties. I cannot resist the temptation to remark that the building societies are obviously a mightily influential pressure group. The building societies and the Law Society in tandem have obviously had a considerable impact upon the Minister, and no doubt all the other interests in this area will look with envy upon their success. For all that, I welcome at least the attempt that has been made, particularly in amendment No. 162, to deal with this difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely convinced that the Minister has adequately or totally dealt with the point. First, let me give a general welcome to the protection that is given in the case of the hidden spouse. I accept that where someone who is selling a house purports to have no spouse, and yet there is one in Australia, that is still a difficult situation, because at the end of the day, when that spouse returns from transportation, or whatever has taken her to Australia, she may find herself prejudiced by a sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an affidavit is sworn by the entitled spouse declaring that there is no spouse, or if an apparent consent is produced, on the balance of social convenience I think that the sale to the third party should be protected. I am tempted to suggest that the arrival of an unknown spouse from Australia to settle in might give an unrivalled social opportunity to the new owner, but that should possibly be put on one side. But on the rare occasion on which the spouse does return and an affidavit has been falsely sworn or a consent forged in her name, clearly her only right of redress is against her husband. If the husband has to go to those lengths, he may
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
well have enough guile to ensure that there are no assets against which she can pursue her obvious claim for prejudice. By that time, he is likely to be living, if not in Australia, in the Yukon or some equally unlikely place with the wrongly-acquired proceeds of the sale. He will be determined to defeat his wife's claims. I think there is a genuine problem in that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the husband's ability to slip off to the "Yukon with the proceeds of the sale would have been equally available to him under the Bill as it presently stands because he can commit fraud in exactly the same way and depart with the proceeds. The only difference is that the only circumstance in which the wife will not have the protection she would have had previously is where the husband, not for financial gain but for pure spite, wishes to deny the wife the exercise of her occupancy rights. If it were for financial gain, he could do that in any event under the Bill in its previous form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether that is so. I will come on to that because it is the second and perhaps the more important point that I want to make. I would dispute that because I think that a careful conveyancer of the type that used to bedevil my youth many years ago when I used to try to draw up conveyances would come back to me as the seller's agent and say " Have you a consent"? My client, although married, having represented to me as his solicitor that he was not married, I would say " But he is not married". A careful conveyancer might be suspicious of that and one might find great difficulty in convincing him, short of obtaining some sort of indemnity policy, that there might be difficulty in the sale going ahead because the other side would not be satisfied as to good title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that it is clear that we can get good title on the swearing of an affidavit, the sale can go ahead and the real rights of the hidden spouse can be defeated. When she comes back, she will have to claim against her husband, who I suspect will have either made off or will certainly have arranged his assets in such a way as to defeat any claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These must be rare situations, but I should have thought that, in view of their rarity, the Government should stand guarantee to the title in the same way as they stand guarantee to the Land Registry. I think that the rate of progress, given certain events in the Civil Service, has been very slow, but once the Land Registry covers Scotland, I understand that if a registered title is challenged correctly, the right of recourse for the dispossessed " owner" will be the Government. I should have thought that there should be some sort of extension of that indemnity to cover the admittedly rare cases that we are discussing. I think that, having allowed the sale to take place, the Government should be prepared to take up the tab and pay compensation on some arbitration principle to any such spouse who turns up and finds that her rights have been defeated. I should have preferred that kind of guarantee to cover the occasional case of hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
The second point is technical, but it is one about which the Minister must have thought and which I raise seriously. It goes back to my careful conveyancer. What happens if I am selling my house, I am either divorced or unmarried, I purport to sell my house for £40,000 and the purchaser's solicitor comes to me and says " But how do we know that you are not telling a lie? Perhaps you are married and are just pretending to be a bachelor "? How does amendment No. 162 over that situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members look at the wording, they will see that an affidavit can be sworn saying that there is no non-entitled spouse, which would apparently cover that situation. But that affidavit can only be sworn by an entitled spouse. By definition, if the seller is genuinely a bachelor, he is not an entitled spouse and therefore he cannot sign such an affidavit. But I make the point: how can the purchaser's solicitor be sure that he is a bachelor, because there is no register of marriages similar to a register of inhibitions or a register of sasines. I should have thought that it would have been necessary, to make amendment No. 162 complete, to have some sort of provision that the entitled spouse or any seller can swear an affidavit. The point is that he is not a spouse. Any bachelor can swear and sign an affidavit saying " I am not married. I have no spouse lurking in the undergrowth, whether in Tanganyika, Australia or wherever, who will come back and disturb the quiet possession of the gentleman who will pay me £40,000 for my shack in Bishopriggs", or wherever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may sound a humorous point, and I am putting it humorously, but I make it seriously and I am sure that the Minister appreciates it. He has gone a long way down the road to meet the objection that the concession applies only to entitled spouses. It is someone who has never been a spouse and who perhaps intends never to be a spouse who has the problem of establishing to the careful purchaser who might well want that kind of reassurance that there is no impediment in his title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the matter can be met by an indemnity policy. There could be a situation in which the bachelor seller not only gave assurances, but put his money behind those assurances by going to a reputable insurance company. No doubt in time there would be a scale of premiums to guard against such an event. But that is not a satisfactory situation. It places an additional burden on the unmarried seller of property which I should be sorry to see forced back on to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly there is no provision in amendment No. 162, as drafted, to meet my point. Hon. Members may think that the purchaser's agent who raised that point was being devious and unreasonably careful. But I know solicitors who would feel strongly about this matter. I make no bones about the fact that I have been lobbied by the Law Society of Scotland on this point. If the Law Society feels strongly about it, perhaps its conveyancing sub-committee will suggest to hon. Mem
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
bers that a guarantee of this kind is necessary. It is a serious point, therefore, which should not be swept aside. I hope that the Minister will have something constructive to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I compliment my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State on this amendment. There was a difficulty in the Bill, as drafted. This is an important change to protect the rights of third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend does not need to be defensive about the technique that he has used to provide this protection rather than the matrimonial homes notices which the Scottish Law Commission proposed. It is clear from pages 38, 39 and 40 of its report on this matter that it is not entirely confident about its proposal. Indeed, it admits that the selection of the appropriate register for these matrimonial homes notices has caused some difficulty. It was not clear whether they properly became part of the property registers, whether they should be part of the personal registers or whether there should be a new category of register. The very fact of this procedural difficulty confronting the Law Commission is a fair indication that its proposal was not without anxiety attaching to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, I welcome the amendment. But, like the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), I should be interested to hear his answer to the poiht about the bachelor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) considers the merits of the overall situation, he will accept that, both under the Bill as drafted and as amended in the way proposed, a husband who is determined to achieve financial gain by fraudulent means is in exactly the same position. In both cases he will deny the existence of a spouse, sell the property to a third party and no doubt try to retain the gains of that transaction, either in the Yukon or elsewhere, depending on his personal preference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference occasioned by the amendment is the position of the non-entitled spouse if that circumstance arises. Whereas under the Bill in its present form she would have an overriding interest as against a third party, the result of the amendment would be to make the reverse true—that, in the circumstances set out in the amendment, the third party's right would supersede that of the non-entitled spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the wording of the amendment may be insufficient to deal with a genuine bachelor. On the face of it, it seemed reasonable to ask: how can an entitled spouse sign or swear an affidavit declaring that there is not a non-entitled spouse, because, if he is telling the truth, then he is not an entitled spouse? I think that that was the gravamen of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a misreading of the clause. I shall explain why, because it took me a little time to come to the conclusion that it was a misreading of the clause. The clause is relevant only where there are entitled and non-entitled spouses. Where there is a genuine bachelor, there is no possibility of a spouse being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
able to claim occupancy rights. Therefore, we are dealing with a situation where, despite the seller maintaining the contrary, there turns out at the end of the day to be a non-entitled spouse who might seek to exercise her occupancy rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A non-entitled spouse who seeks to claim her occupancy rights would be entitled to have preference over a third party, unless that third party were able to produce an affidavit sworn or affirmed by the seller that there was no non-entitled spouse or where there had been a renunciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will not apply in any case where the entitled spouse has sworn an affidavit that there is no non-entitled spouse. He does not have to swear that affidavit as an entitled spouse or in his capacity as an entitled spouse. All it means is that the individual who has sworn the affidavit is the same individual who subsequently turns out to have been an entitled spouse at the time the house was sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following this point with great interest and considerable care. I see what the Minister is saying. If it were true, it would meet my point entirely. I am not suggesting that he is being mendacious in any sense, but I do not understand how it can be true on the words in the clause. The whole Bill is bristling with spouses—I suppose it is not " spice", but " spouse"—of one sort and another. Amendment No. 162 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the dealing comprises the purchase of a matrimonial home by a third party who has acted in good faith, if, at the time of the dealing, there is produced to the third party by the entitled spouse".</p></blockquote>
The Minister seems to be saying that any seller can, for these purposes, be treated as an entitled spouse. If I am buying from a bachelor, or someone who holds himself out to me as a bachelor, and I get from him an affidavit that he is truly a bachelor and there is no spouse, then, for the purposes of the Bill, he is an entitled spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says " No", but that is what I took him to be saying. If the answer to that is " No", then I cannot see what statutory authority there is for the bachelor making an affidavit and I cannot see that that affidavit, if given, would in any way protect the third party against the rights of the unknown but, as it turns out, entirely substantial and real spouse who may turn up and claim occupancy rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain more easily this way. There is no statutory obligation on a bachelor to provide such a statement. However, it may be demanded of him by the buyer. The buyer may say " Your statement is not sufficient. I want a sworn affidavit from you as a bachelor that you are a bachelor and that there is no non-entitled spouse." If he then voluntarily agrees to give such a statement, and if he turns out subsequently to have been an entitled spouse at the time he gave it, although he did not admit it, the proviso will have been met. A statement will have been sworn by
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
the seller, who at that time—although he concealed the fact—was an entitled spouse, that there was no non-entitled spouse. Therefore, the safeguard that the bona fide third party requires will have been met and the bona fide third party's rights will supersede those of the non-entitled spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now I see the argument. I make no bones about saying that I shall want to take advice on it. At least I see it. For my own benefit, the Minister is saying that if the seller swears an affidavit to the effect that he is a bachelor and there is no spouse and that is a true statement of the facts, occupancy rights do not emerge and its invalidity is therefore unimportant. If it turns out that he purports to be a bachelor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of its invalidity being unimportant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A statutory provision is not needed to provide a warrant of any kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow that. It was an unfortunate choice of words. In any event, it is irrelevant because he is a bachelor. Therefore, there are no occupancy rights to defeat. If it turns out, sadly, that there are occupancy rights to defeat, it is immediately imported into the cover of amendment No. 162 and the third party is protected. We should then be back to my other point: what happens to the unfortunate spouse who finds that there is no-one against whom she can proceed? Should not the Government be the long-stop in that situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we have narrowed down the circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is correct. In these very limited circumstances, where the husband has deliberately run the risk of prosecution for no financial benefit to himself but simply to spike his wife's occupancy rights, the wife would be in no worse or no better position than she is at the moment. It is simply a question whether, on balance, that is necessary in order to protect the interests of the third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is agreed that that should be so. The hon. Gentleman's point is whether the Government should be prepared to provide compensation in these circumstances. We have to look in a very restricted way at the areas in which the Government should provide compensation because of fraud or loss of opportunity as between private citizens. If, under the registration of title procedure, it turns out to have been incorrect, the Government, as sponsors of the register, may have some responsibility. But in the area covered by the Bill I do not think such a proposition can be put forward convincingly. It is on that basis that I believe the amendment to be the most suitable way of dealing with the situation, and it has been welcomed by the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholly accept the arguments which my hon. Friend has put forward. But will he confirm that there is no complication arising out of occupancy rights that might have been conferred by the court under clause 16 about cohabiting couples? As a matter of judicial order, occupancy rights are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0992">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
conferred under clause 16. If such occupancy rights were to be conferred, would that not be a complication?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend looks at clause 16, he will see that under subsection (3) there is no indication that clause 6 is relevant to the rights of a cohabiting couple. In other words, only parts of the Bill are relevant to cohabiting couples, and clause 6 is not one of those parts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, as so often, to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr Fraser) for giving us advance notice of a point which I had intended to raise on clause 16. I am not sure that a cohabitee would not be a complication under clause 6. There may be situations in which cohabitees ought to have some rights in the home of a stable union, but that is something which we could perhaps more reasonably debate on clause 16. There are some amendments down which I hope will provide a useful peg for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful exchange. I know that there will be people more expert than I in the mysteries of conveyancing who will consider the explanation he has given, which I find to have some merit. However, I think it will have to be looked at very carefully, because it is a point which has substantially worried the Law Society of Scotland, among others, and was still worrying it in the last few days. It may be that it will want to run an eye over the proposition that has been advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Under-Secretary of State does not feel able to take a more sympathetic view of the small number of cases we have been discussing where there may be defeated occupancy rights. I suppose that on occasions Ministers have to harden their hearts, however much it sorrows, them, and I pass no judgment on the extent to which that is true in this instance. I think that at this stage we shall have to leave it, but this is certainly something we shall want to look at before Report just to be satisfied about the technicalities of what has been said and to see if there is any way in which the last point can be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendement No. 65, in page 9, line 22, leave out " passing " and insert " commencement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the reference to the passing of this measure remains, it could cause serious confusion and uncertainty precisely at the time when the legal profession will be familiarising itself with the provisions of the Bill. So that a prospective purchaser may be sure that no occupancy rights exist, his solicitor will wish to obtain the consent of the non-entitled spouse of the house to be bought, if it is a matrimonial home. Such a consent will be difficult to obtain until the prescribed form of consent is available. The only alternative would be to ask for a renunciation of the non-entitled spouse's occupancy rights in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
It is the Government's intention that the necessary regulations will be made before the Bill comes into operation. It accordingly makes sense to refer to the " commencement" rather than to the " passing " of the Bill. It is on this basis that the amendment is put before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought this might be a useful opportunity to ask the Minister to say a word or two about the timetable and commencement. I notice that on our list of amendments clause 21 does not appear, so presumably this is my only opportunity of raising this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 21(2) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall come into operation on such a day as the Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument appoint, and different days may be so appointed for different provisions and for different purposes."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Minister has any idea when he intends to trigger the various provisions here. I am curious as to whether he can give some indication as to which will be the first. Presumably some are going to need more consultation and more in the way of the laying of orders and therefore may be pushed somewhat further back. It would be helpful if we could have some brief indication of what is in his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to give a specific time scale, but I can indicate to the hon. Gentleman the sort of things which have to be done. For example, advice has to be given to the police about certain of the procedures that they will wish to undertake under certain provisions of the Bill. The building societies will want to review some of their procedures, as will the Law Society of Scotland as far as conveyancing requirements are concerned. There is also the need to draft and propose the regulations required for various documents that will be used under the provisions of the Bill. We certainly want to get down to doing all this as quickly as possible. We have brought forward the Bill as a matter of urgency. Therefore, we have every incentive to wish to see it brought into operation. I cannot advise the hon. Gentleman at this moment as to a specific time scale because I do not know what that would be. However, we have every intention of making it as short as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that helps very much. When Ministers start talking about " consultations " and " as quickly as possible " it is somewhat alarming. How long is a piece of string? I accept that the Government are entitled to credit for having brought the Bill forward promptly, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will push on particularly with clauses 3 and 4 which do not seem to me to raise great difficulties in terms of conveyancing and so on in the short term, although there are property spin offs in terms of statutory consents and so on. However, it does not seem to me that this will create a great deal of difficulty. I give him notice that we shall be speiring fairly regularly that the Bill will be the subject of commencement orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I raise a couple of small points of clarification. No doubt the Minister will give me a very simple lesson in how the Bill is to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is a very minor point on clause 6(2)(a) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"' titled spouse' does not include a spouse who, apart from the provisions of this Act,—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a)is permitted by a third party to occupy a matrimonial home".</p></blockquote>
I wondered to what particular circumstances this referred because throughout the Bill we are told that it is where one spouse is entitled or
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"permitted by a third party to occupy a matrimonial home."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure what the distinction is. Clearly there are circumstances in which someone is permitted by a third party to occupy a home and that makes him an entitled spouse. But we are told here that, apart from that, the same sort of words will encompass people who will not be treated as entitled spouses. Perhaps I am being rather thick, but I am not sure what the distinction is between the two. I do not understand what it strikes at. No doubt the Minister can help me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is a very general one. If I had spent more time worrying about all this, I should probably have had it clear in my mind. In the interpretation clause there is a real omnibus definition of a matrimonial home. It is everything from the family tent to the family mansion, mobile and non-mobile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What interests me is a situation in which the matrimonial home is happily occupied by the spouses, but then they split up. One of them continues to live in it for several years and for some reason sells, perhaps with the consent of the other spouse—presumably there would have to be consent—and buys another matrimonial home and then decides to sell again. That may happen four years after they are married. They may be waiting for the five-year unilateral period, or perhaps they do not want a
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
divorce action for some reason and it may be many years. Would that second house still be a matrimonial home although the wife, who might have an occupancy right, has not in fact lived in it? Would that be covered by " matrimonial home " in terms of clauses 3 and 6? Does it mean that any house bought by the husband while the marriage still exists is a matrimonial home? I presume not. That would seem ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be clear where that is made explicit and whether there is some point at which, if one gets rid of a matrimonial home, it cannot be and is not replaced. I am sure that the Minister follows the point. It would seem ludicrous to try to enforce an occupancy right on a home which has never been occupied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that a house is rented or that the happy couple are living with the husband's in-laws. They then separate and, subsequent to that, the husband buys a house. Would that house—the only house that has ever been owned by either of them, they still being married—be a matrimonial home? Again, I presume that the answer is " No", because it was bought after the separation. But one could have a very interesting argument about what constitutes separation. Is there any definition in the Bill? Perhaps the Minister could follow my line of argument and say a few words about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is desired to be excluded is a situation where the third party may be the person who is actually carrying out the dealing—in other words, the selling of the house. The fact that there is an entitled spouse living there should not in any way make that dealing invalid, or in any way affect the position of other parties. In other words, if the third party is the person who is the owner of the house and wishes to sell it, this provision is to ensure that he is not prevented from doing so, because it would be quite invidious for a bona fide third party who owned the house to have his rights restricted in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the definition of " matrimonial home " is concerned, as the hon. Gentleman will see, it is defined as " a family residence", and my view is that it depends whether, on the facts, the home which was purchased by, say, the husband some years after the parties had separated, but before they were divorced, can properly still be considered a family residence. If, for example, there were 10 children of the marriage, all living with the father, and he were to sell one house and buy another, it would be legitimate to refer to that as the fact continuing. It would not stop being the family residence simply because it was a different house from the one in which the other spouse had originally lived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member will see that the residence of both spouses is not a requirement. It
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been provided or has been made available by one or both of the spouses as, or has become, a family residence".</p></blockquote>
If it is simply a bijou bachelor flat and there are no children involved, it would be difficult to argue that the new property was a family residence. If, on the other hand, the husband has custody of the children, and the only person who is missing is the wife, again it becomes a question of common sense
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
whether in such circumstances it is to be properly considered the family residence. Certainly it would be difficult to argue that what was a family residence in any normal sense of the word had ceased to be one simply because the actual building was a different building, although in every other respect the circumstances were exactly the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are interesting points, and perhaps in different circumstances we might have spent a lot of time on them. As it is, I shall have to spend time thinking about the matter, and perhaps taking a little advice. The first point I understand. I do not see that it is clear from the words here, but I gather that the Minister is saying that in a situation where I am a third party attempting to sell a house in which I have permitted an entitled spouse to dwell, in those circumstances the rights of the entitled spouse shall not defeat my right to sale. We shall have to try to erect a few muddles in that to see how it would work in practice, but it is a plausible proposition and one which I am prepared to take away and think through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is much more complicated, and I am not happy about it. One can argue it either way. Presumably, if the husband, after the couple has separated, buys a house, that is still an asset of the marriage, and would be subject to a capital claim when a divorce ultimately came through. To that extent it might be logical to see it also, therefore, as an asset of the marriage and liable to the provisions of the Bill. It is an important point, as the Minister appreciates, not just in terms of occupancy, but also in terms of the clause, because there may well be a situation in which the husband has bought a nice mews cottage, and if the Minister is right—he says it is a matter of common sense, and I may say that common sense is a rare commodity in broken marriages—and the Bill does not apply to it, of course it can be sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be sold at the whim of the husband, and that could have a great effect upon the capital assets that might be available when ultimately the parties get round to a divorce. If it is covered by this provision, even supposing that the lady had no wish to exercise her occupancy rights because it was a bijou bachelor flat, she would still have the comforting knowledge that the asset could not be dissipated. The flat could not be sold unless she had consented. She is therefore in a very much stronger position in terms of the manoeuvring and of the tactical arguments that may go on in the run-up to a final settlement of the financial arrangements on the break-up of the marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore, a matter of real substance. My instinct is, though I know that this is not in the Bill at the moment, that a matrimonial home really ought to be a home that is owned by the couple, or one of the spouses, at a period when they are living together. Once they are separated, it is a false distinction to say that if the husband has been fortunate enough, which is an unusual thing in the law of Scotland, to get custody of the children, at that stage he has hurriedly to think, " I had better
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
not trade up-market. I had better not get a more adequate house so that wee Jeannie can have a bedroom of her own because, by God, if I do that I am merely tying up more money in an asset and my wife may turn up and try to exercise occupancy rights or may make life awkward for me under the Act. If I am in rented accommodation I have none of these problems." One could imagine circumstances in which some rather strange by-products could flow from what the Minister has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to prolong this, Mr. Henderson. We are trying to make progress. But perhaps the Minister could think about it. I am not sure that we have a satisfactory situation here. It is open to a variety of different interpretations; there are bound to be grey areas. Nor am I sure that the common-sense interpretation of the Bill which the Minister has suggested is one which is right or inevitably follows from the drafting which he has laid before the Committee. These are interesting points, and they are of some substance, and I should be happy to leave it on that basis, having indicated a little alarm and invited the Minister to consider the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rikfind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to do just that. I certainly appreciate that problems could arise from an indefinite continuation of the concept of the matrimonial home, even though it may not be a home in which both spouses have ever lived together. I shall certainly give further thought to the matter to see whether some alteration would be justified. However, we are also dealing with a situation where it would clearly be artificial to say that what was purely a matrimonial home, given the circumstances, had ceased to be so simply because the building in which the spouse and the children were living turned out to be a different building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that. That would be far to extreme a position. It would be ludicrous if the fact that someone had stopped living in it meant that it was then no longer a matrimonial home. My point is that there should perhaps be some definition which suggests that they have to have lived in it at some point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem that we are facing. Let us say that both spouses have lived in a house and one spouse leaves. The husband and two children continue to live in the house for two years, and then the husband disposes of the house and buys another house in which he also lives with the children. It is difficult to believe that that is any less a family residence than the house which was lived in during the first two years after the separation. But I certainly undertake to give further thought to this matter to see whether some change might be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and where in the case of a minor the court does make such an order any transaction which results cannot be challenged within the quadriennium utile by the non-titled spouse".</p></blockquote>
This is a comparatively minor point but one which I found of interest. It occurred to me as a potential difficulty. In clause 7 we are dealing with an application of an entitled spouse to dispense with the consent of a non-entitled spouse to a dealing which has taken place or a proposed dealing. I am not clear how a dealing can have taken place. I always thought that the whole point was that there could not be a dealing until there had been a consent. That point occurs to me literally as I read the clause and perhaps the Minister could deal with it equally instantly in his reply. I do not see how the dealing can have taken place if the consent is required for which the application for waiver is being made under clause 7. However, that is by the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing is that that waiver shall be granted if " consent is unreasonably withheld" or the non-entitled spouse is a minor. I presume that that is likely to be a waiver from the courts which is obtained, not on the intiative of the entitled spouse, but I suspect that it will be obtained more commonly on the initiative of the purchaser's solicitors—for example, in a case where the husband is 20 and the wife only 16. They may not be satisfied about accepting the wife's consent and they would rather have a waiver from the court which makes it clear that her consent is not necessary in case. Having taken her consent, she then turns up within the quadriennium utile and says that there has been a norm lesion and she has been severely prejudiced; there is a quantifiable loss and she therefore wants to overturn the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it is quite clear that a minor can, as in any other conveyance transaction, enter into a form of consent, but it is a form that may not be acceptable to the other party. The point, therefore, of the court's waiving it is that it should protect that purchaser against any claim within the quadriennium utile. The purpose of the amendment is simply to make that clear and to esablish whether that is the position as the Minister sees it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment because I was curious to know whether, even where there has been consent
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
to the court to waive the involvement of the minor spouse, that would preclude any claim. It might be hard to pursue the claim in any event, on the grounds that there could not be a norm lesion if the court adjudicated that it was fair and right that the waiver should be dispensed with. But that would presume that the court would be acting as a sort of impartial arbiter on behalf of such a minor spouse and would presumably entail an inquiry with counsel, agent or what-have-you, appointed to argue any possible interest against the waiver which the spouse may have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly that would be inevitable if the minor spouse was refusing to consent, perhaps being advised. But if it was on the initiative of the applicant's solicitor in the situation that I have outlined, the standing of that waiver should be more tightly defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a large point but it has been left a little in limbo. It begs a few questions and the Minister will no doubt explain exactly how the Government see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"a dealing which has taken place".</p></blockquote>
That provides the discretion to the court to invalidate retrospectively a dealing which technically would otherwise be invalid. It seems inappropriate that, if a dealing has gone through where the court, if it had been asked beforehand, would have dispensed with the need for the consent of the other spouse because she was in Australia, for instance, it should have been forbidden from doing so simply because that consent was not obtained in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the substance of the amendment is concerned, I make two points. First, I am advised that if an order had been made by the court it would not be possible, even without the hon. Gentleman's amendment, for that order to be challenged in the way that he suggested. Secondly, the rules that cover the quadriennium utile in respect of minors are really in respect of contracts that have been entered into in the name of that minor, which he might subsequently wish to challenge on the grounds that are normally available. There we are not talking about any contract that has been entered into by the minor but the fact that the consent of that minor has not been considered to be necessary as a result of the views of the court. As a consequence, there would be no possibility of such a decision being challenged. So the hon. Gentleman's objectives are already safeguarded under the existing wording of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But I had always understood—it may be my total ignorance—that if I had decided to buy a house and the disposition was being granted by a minor, I did it at my peril. There might well be no challenge, but I should have thought that that minor could well have turned up within the four

year period, said, " I did not know what I was doing " and invited the court—which might be reluctant to do it in the circumstances—to overturn the conveyance.

78, in line 21, after " dealing", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in the view of the court there has been in the interim period no material change in circumstance".</p></blockquote>
These are amendments of some importance in the sense that they raise some important questions. I have expressed anxiety intermittently about whether there is enough protection for the entitled spouse in some of the mechanisms of this Bill. Now I raise the other cry, and that is that I am alarmed at the ease, in terms of clause 7, with which an entitled spouse can obtain a waiver from the courts of the need for the non-entitled spouse's consent. I suggest, Mr. Henderson, that we might well also consider amendments Nos. 78 and 79 for the purposes of discussion because they are very much interrelated, and I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 78 takes the first grounds on which the courts have to be satisfied before granting an order dispensing with consent. The first one is where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the non-titled spouse has led the titled spouse to believe that he or she would consent to the dealing".</p></blockquote>
I think it was worth putting down an amendment to find out what exactly is envisaged here. I suggest in amendment No. 78 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in the view of the court there has been in the interim period no material change in circumstance".</p></blockquote>
should be inserted. I do it because, on the face of it, this subsection seems to say that if the court is satisfied on evidence that the non-entitled spouse at some time—there is no time limit on it; presumably it could have been years before—had led the entitled spouse to believe that he or she would consent, it might be that, at the beginning of a very long and protracted series of negotiations about the break-up of a marriage—let us say, at the point where they are separating and where the non-entitled spouse has not had substantial legal advice about her rights—she might very well before witnesses at, a round table family dismussion say " All right I will go along with that. I will consent to the sale of the house and the following things will then happen." Ultimately she sits down and thinks about it. She gets advice from someone knowledgeable in these matters and it is pointed out to her
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
that she is getting an extremely bad deal out of this proposition and that she is alienating rights which she could exercise which are perhaps of substantial importance to herself and the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances it would be quite monstrous that her consent should be enforced by the court merely on the basis of a well attested and established fact that she had promised to consent at an earlier date. It may be that that is not a very likely situation, nor one that is intended to be covered by the words. But as they are drafted that is at least a fair interpretation. Once the court is satisfied that the non-entitled spouse had led the entitled spouse to believe that she would consent, that is all it needs to know and it should dispense with her consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that my form of words is not entirely satisfactory, but I think that this embroidery, this widening of the matter, really is necessary to make it clear that the court has to be satisfied that she had intended to consent and had led the entitled spouse to believe that she intended to consent. But I think we have to leave it to the court to say that, notwithstanding the fact that six months or a year or two years ago she had led him to believe that she would consent, there has been a material change of circumstances or she has rightly appreciated that she was unaware of the true nature of her rights in a matrimonial break-down situation, and in these circumstances we must accept that she has a right to change her mind and withhold that consent until such time as a more equitable arrangement is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maybe the Minister is going to say that all that can be covered, but let me say to him—I feel strongly about this—that the form of words in the Bill is misleading. It seems to be very tightly drafted, but I believe that at least prima facie there is virtue in the amendment or in some form of words which would give the same effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 deals with the second situation, which is that the court has to be satisfied, when we are talking about consent being unreasonably withheld, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"two written requests for consent to the dealing have been sent to the spouse at the spouse's last known address (the second request being sent not earlier than 14 days after the first request) and the receipt of neither request has been acknowledged."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps it is not meant to be taken literally, but it is a plain unvarnished interpretation of the words. If the unfortunate spouse happened to go away on a five-weeks' holiday and left her house, in which she was perhaps living with other parties—for example, a landlady—and the landlady accepted the intimation from the husband, perhaps by recorded delivery, and a fortnight later accepted a similar intimation and propped them against the mantelpiece and did nothing more, on coming back from her recuperation in Margate, or wherever it is, she would discover, to her horror, that she had failed to acknoweldge two intimations and therefore had established the grounds whereby the court, apparently without discretion, could waive her consent to the sale of the matrimonial home.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is self-evidently an unsatisfactory situation. It may be, again, that I am showing a lack of vision and flexibility and a failing to read into the Bill what is there. If I have done that, I fear that many others will do so, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment that I have put down acknowledges the realities of the situation by adding
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the court is satisfied that reasonable inquiries have been made to establish the whereabouts of the non-titled spouse".</p></blockquote>
These are wide discretions. The amendment would allow the court to say " No, we are not satisfied on two letters a fortnight apart. You know that she has a settled address. Have you been round to see her and made any inquiries? Have you got in touch with her mother? " It does not need to be a scouring of the seven continents of the world, but at least it would allow the courts that measure of discretion before taking the important step of saying, " We are in fact going to dispense with consent and allow the sale of a house that may be a valuable— indeed, the sole—asset of the marriage."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points are self-evident. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to look at them, at least sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has done a valuable service to the Committee. Although I am unable to accept the wording of either amendment, I am able to say that the principles behind them are valid and deserve to be recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the first amendment is concerned, the hon. Gentleman is correct that it is obviously relevant for the court to take into account any changes in circumstances since consent was given. I am not sure that that would have been excluded by the existing wording, but there is no harm in making that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, in respect of the second amendment, the hon. Gentleman is not unreasonable in saying that the court should be satisfied that it is not possible to ascertain the whereabouts of the spouse. We know of many cases—for example, divorce actions—in which the whereabouts of the spouse are not known. The court expects reasonable inquiries to have been made before it will dispense with citation of the spouse or, indeed, of a third party who may be mentioned in the summons. There is certainly no basic reason why a similar principle should not apply in this area. We will certainly undertake to bring forward appropriate amendments to cover the points which the hon. Gentleman has raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are a number of significant matters in the Bill. Two or three are still to come, but this is certainly one of them, and it has worried the Opposition from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 deals with the right of transfer of a tenancy under clause 12. Subsection (1) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court may, on the application of a non-titled spouse, make an order transferring the tenancy of a matrimonial home to that spouse".</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to make certain provisions about compensation, to which we shall no doubt come later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from what was said on consideration of principle that this clause is in this form largely to deal with a leasehold house where the lease could be transferred for a consideration. I accept that that is possible as future development in Scot
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
land, but certainly my experience is that a domestic leasehold of a kind that is likely to be transferable for value is extremely rare in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt those who have looked at the flat market in England—in London in particular—have recoiled in horror from what they have found. The normal thing here is a lease of perhaps 99 years. Such a lease may be worth scores, in some cases hundreds, of thousands of pounds if it is the right address with the right facilities. I may say in passing that I have a Presbyterian horror of sitting watching my asset depreciate year by year. It is an almost insuperable barrier to purchase. In any event, that is not commonly found in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of tenancies in Scotland in the domestic home market are council houses. The real relevance of clause 12 will be to the transfer of a council house from an entitled spouse to a non-entitled spouse. What worries the Opposition—this is a matter of real importance in terms of housing policy—is that there may be a tendency for certain local authorities cheerfully to say " We are not going to move on an administrative basis. We are not going to deal with this as soon as the marriage breaks up, because, after all, the non-entitled spouse, the person who is not our tenant, has a perfect right to go to the court under section 12 for a transfer."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What alarms us is that, instead of saying—as many rather more enlightened local authorities do at the moment—" Mr. X is the tenant nominally, but there is a wife and three children and it is a four-roomed house. It would be sensible to give the tenancy to Mrs. X to rehouse Mr. X in a house or flat of a suitable size for him and to have the matrimonial home preserved for and occupied by the wife and family." There may be a tendency for such action to be discouraged by the knowledge that the wife can go to the court and make an application under clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The performance of local authorities in this respect varies greatly. Some will not make any transfer of tenancy until they know that the divorce action is well advanced. Others take a much more flexible view and try to cope with the social realities of a situation as soon as it becomes manifest that it is a semi-permanent or real split which has been effected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that some local authorities are tempted to stand on their rights. The existence of clause 12, and the amendment to repeal paragraph 6 of Part I of Schedule 2 of the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 may encourage local authorities to dig in their heels and say " It is none of our business. Let them go to the court and sort this out. We shall transfer the tenancy when the court makes an order to that effect."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of some anxiety. Perhaps I should declare a vested interest. No doubt it would suit the legal profession, because a non-entitled spouse may be non-entitled to the house but she would be entitled under the legal aid scheme, and many actions in the sheriff court under clause 12 would mean many a good legal aid certificate for the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0999">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
That is not a matter of great substance. It merely makes the point that, if it became the norm to go for an order under clause 12, there would be certain public expenditure implications. Certainly it would lead to substantial delays which might be hard to justify. Obviously an administrative transfer of the tenancy by the local authority would not stop the lady in question—if it be the wife—from going to the court under clause 3 for declarator of occupancy at the same time. However, it would ensure that at the earliest possible stage the local authority would be encouraged to look at the realities and act accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend for a moment that amendment No. 113 is necessarily in the best drafted terms. I do not suppose that there is anything in the Bill which prohibits a local authority from making its own arrangements as landlord in terms of a disputed house which it lets. But I thought that there was positive virtue, and some of my colleagues may agree, in writing into the Bill a specific statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this section shall prejudice the right of a local authority to transfer the tenancy of a matrimonial home let by them from the titled spouse to his or her non-titled spouse in terms of that authority's normal letting regulation."</p></blockquote>
It should be " regulations " and not " regulation", but the meaning is clear. It is important to stress, even if it does mean two or three extra lines in what will ultimately be the Act, that this is a right open to local authorities and is not tramelled or inhibited necessarily by the passing of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, I am sure, was not drafted with council house tenancies in mind. It may be seen to affect them and, as they are by far the most numerous forms of leasehold in respect of matrimonial homes, it seems to be a matter on which the Committee should delay for a minute or two to consider whether we should take further precautions to make sure that we have got this right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be generally agreed that when there is a matrimonial dispute and when the future right to occupy the property is one of the matters in issue, one of the major and desirable aspects is that it should be for the court to decide the rights of the competing parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has concentrated his remarks on the position of local authorities as a result of the Bill. I am happy to respond to that general point. He will recollect that, under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, an interim measure was introduced which enabled a local authority, as an administrative means, in a situation in which there had been a matrimonial break-up, to transfer the tenancy from one spouse to another. When we introduced that amendment to the Tenants' Rights Act it was specifically stated as an interim measure which would improve the situation which then existed and which could help deal with the position of a spouse in the break-up of a marriage until such time as the recommendations of the Law Commission could be brought forward in a proper legislative form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
If we have to choose in a situation of matrimonial break-up between the local authority on the one hand and the court on the other as being the person who decides who is the appropriate tenant of the property, I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree that, in virtually every conceivable circumstance, if a matrimonial break-up has taken place it is highly desirable that it should be the court which determines the rights in respect of the parties and highly undesirable that the local authority should have that obligation imposed upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing that local authorities hate more than being asked to act as Solomon between a husband and wife who have a mutual disagreement where one is the tenant and the other would wish to be the tenant, and the local authority, with no access to any real information as to the nature of the dispute between the parties and, indeed, no interest in the matter, is nevertheless being asked to judge which of the spouses should become the tenant of the local authority property. The local authority does not have the means to come to a proper judgment in these matters. It certainly does not have the inclination to do so. It very often does not have access to the information that will be required. It does not have the solemnity of the procedure of the court to ensure that the evidence being given to it is likely to be truthful and it does not have any of the other means that are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there was no other procedure available, if the only way by which the wife could get tenancy of the House was by the local authority having the power to do so, it would clearly be desirable that that power should be available to it to be used where thought appropriate. But I have no doubt whatsoever that the local authorities do not relish such a role and think it far more appropriate that, if there is to be a question of transfer of a tenancy the court should determine the outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to add that nothing in the clause or in the Bill prevents a local authority, where a husband who, as a spouse, has voluntarily given up the tenancy of a property, giving the tenancy to the other spouse. It is perfectly free to re-allocate the tenancy in the way it thinks appropriate. But what the hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned with is a situation where the husband as the tenant does not wish to give up tenancy of the property, and the question is whether, in these circumstances, the spouse must go to court if she wishes to exercise her occupancy rights and have the tenancy transferred into her name. I cannot conceive of a situation where we should say that, although the spouse is quite unwilling to go to court to have the matter determined in a judicial fashion, nevertheless the local authority should be expected to come to a decision which the court has not been given an opportunity to determine, as between the rights in respect of its house. That seems to me highly undesirable and to be avoided if possible, and we are in a situation now where it will be able to be avoided, which seems far more satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in these circumstances that the clause is drafted in its present form, and I should be extremely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1000">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

surprised if the hon. Gentleman were suggesting that the administrative framework, which is a local authority, should be expected to exercise a judgment as to the threat to the spouse, the threat to the children of the spouse, and other questions relating to the tenancy and occupancy of the property in question. It seems to me to be an undesirable approach, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have had a number of representations and I am not sure that the Minister, certainly in the spirit in which he replied, is in any sense right. I can see the argument that, if there is a hot dispute and the tenant is saying that he will not leave, almost inevitably we may end up in a situation in which we shall have to have recourse to the courts— and perhaps, sadly, that is the only place where a final decision will be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not say that I welcome that possibility, and I think that there is a number of occasions on which local authorities will transfer the tenancy— even a situation in which the husband may have left the house and, I fear, the local authorities may take the view that, until the wife has gone to the court for a transfer of tenancy, it will not move under its letting regulations and will invite her to take an action under clause 12 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would emphasise that, where the tenant has left the house, the right of the local authority under the Tenants Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980 to bring that tenancy to an end because the tenancy has been vacated is, and will continue to be, exactly the same whether or not there is a spouse who might become the new tenant of the same property. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the Act gives for the first time security of tenure to tenants, but it also provides for certain circumstances in which a tenancy may be brought to an end against the wishes of the tenant, either for non-payment of rent or for vacation of the property or for various other circumstances. But if, indeed, under one of these provisions, the tenancy has been brought to an end, there is nothing whatsoever to prevent the local authority from reallocating the tenancy to the spouse of the original tenant. Therefore, it is in these circumstances that the hon. Gentleman will wish to consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly want to consider the matter because I think it raises quite important points of difference of approach and emphasis between the members of the Committee. I am unhappy at the idea that one will have to go to the court under clause 12. Presumably, one may go to the sheriff court and ask for such an order. Subsection (2) refers to the Court of Session, but presumably that is only exclusive because it goes on to refer to divorces or nullities of marriage. Presumably, for example, if one has an action going in the sheriff court for separation, or if one has no matrimonial action going at all, one will be able to go to the sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should be interested to know what procedure will be used. It is presumably an appli-
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
cation. Presumably, one will not have to apply and wait for legal aid to be granted in a normal way with inquiries by the DHSS into income and so on, because, if so, one will wait for a very long time and the position of the applicant spouse may be severely prejudiced. Presumably, there will be some sort of emergency certificate procedure under legal aid which will get the action into court quickly for the kind of inquiry which the Minister has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In emergency situations, there is nothing to stop the normal application for occupancy rights by the applicant spouse going ahead in the normal way. She may get occupancy rights; she may even get an exclusion order against the other spouse. The question of the actual formal transfer of the tenancy is hardly likely to be an urgent matter. It is the occupancy question and the exclusion order aspects which are likely to be urgent, and these matters are dealt with under the previous clauses which the Committee has considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that, but it is cumbersome and expensive. It will involve legal aid and representation. That is unfortunate. If I may stray, Mr. Henderson, as I am sure you will allow me to do, on to a later amendment, it might save me from speaking to it. That is amendment No. 127, which would leave out subsection (11) of clause 12. That refers to paragraph 6 of part 1 of schedule 2. It would allow the landlord to recover possession of a dwelling house on the ground that he wished to
	<br><blockquote><p>"transfer the secure tenancy of the dwelling house to the spouse or former spouse of the tenant, or to a person with whom the tenant has been living as man and wife, where either the tenant or the spouse, former spouse or person aforesaid no longer wishes to live together with the other in the dwelling house, and the spouse, former spouse or person aforesaid has applied to the landlord for the transfer of the tenancy. "</p></blockquote>
That was a specific statutory entitlement, written in very recently, in 1980.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not on the Standing Committee so I do not remember how interim it was. But it was an important power to be given to the local authority, though it has now been revoked. My trouble is that, while I accept that there may be circumstances where there is a head-on collision between the spouses and where they are not prepared to accept the arbitration of the landlord—in this case., the local authority—I believe that there are many cases where a sympathetic local authority can approach as landlord, and use its position to say, " We should like to ensure that this house is fully occupied by the wife and the children," is prepared to rehouse the other spouse, and can in fact, if it uses its good offices, accommodate the situation The Minister will say, no doubt, that that will still be possible. I can see him nodding. The whole spirit in which he has addressed himself to this problem, and the narrow drafting of clause 12, the fact that there is no verbal gesture at all of the kind that I am inviting the Committee to consider, will encourage local authorities to say—as he says, be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1001">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
cause some of them do not like being involved because it is difficult—" We want nothing to do with this, we are going to back off from it, we are going to do our Pontius Pilate act and leave it in all cases to the courts."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is wrong, and I see no harm at all, while accepting the extreme cases the Minister has outlined, in saying that there is nothing that shall prejudice the right of a local authority to deal with the matter within the normal letting regulations. It would just be some sort of encouragement to local authorities to act sensibly and justly in a situation where they are facing the break-up of a marriage and therefore a de facto change in the tenancy situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not labour this point. It do not expect a 'engthy debate in any event. I just wish to make it quite clear that I take this matter seriously, and I shall go back to the local authorities and test it out with them, to see what they feel. It may be that they can convince me. I do not always agree with local authorities, but they may be able to convince me that the Minister is right. If so, it will be a rare pleasure for him, and one that in the months ahead will become rarer. I will put it to the test. My present inclination, while I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, Mr. Henderson, is that I do so on the clear indication that I shall want to return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 13, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1B) No compensation under subsection (1) above shall be payed a title spouse in consideration of his or her right to buy a local authority house in terms of part I of the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Act 1980'.</p></blockquote>
This is an interesting little amendment in the sense that it flows again, from clause 12. It is clear that clause 12 says that the court may transfer the tenancy, because it has, to use the Minister's words, "the solemnity of procedure", which is apparently an advantage in these matters, in his view, though not necessarily in mine. It can then go on and make an order
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the payment by the non-titled spouse to the titled spouse for such compensation as seems just and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case".</p></blockquote>
This raises interesting matters. The most common situation in which there will be recourse to the courts will be where a council house tenancy is being transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought, when I put down the amendment, that I might well be quickly suppressed by the Minister with the intimation that he did not think that the clause applied to council house tenancies, but in fact it is clear from what he has said that he thinks that it will. Indeed, the main work of the clause will be adjudicating between husbands and wives who live under the auspices of the various district councils in Scotland. As a result of the " blessings " conferred upon us—I use that word in inverted commas— by the Tenants' Rights, etc. (Scotland) Act 1980,
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
part I, let me make it clear to the Minister that there would be, as the clause is presently drafted, a perfectly fair application made for transfer of tenancy. It would be met, perhaps, not with an objection on the merits, but with an application for compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have people who live, for example, in Knightswood, or Moss Park, or in the Ridgeway—I take my own city—which are some of the more popular housing areas, they may well be in a semi-detatched house with a garden, a garage, and appurtenances thereto, which by any market valuation would be worth £20,000. Let us say that a man has been living for long with his wife and the marriage has broken up at the point where there was a very long established tenancy. That man has a potential right to buy. He might even be in the process of doing so, which would bring to him a capital gain of about £10,000. If he loses that tenancy, what is his position if he goes to the court and says, " I am not disputing the social justice of the transfer, but I am certainly disputing the social justice of a situation where I am going to lose a very substantial capital gain which I had hoped to make out of the discount that will arise from my length of tenancy"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be all sorts of interesting arguments. That man might be being rehoused by the district authority, and he would take his length of tenancy —the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—into his new house. Even though the homeless persons' code may say that he should be rehoused in an area which is comparable, that is often not possible. If it is an area that is comparable, he may very well, as a bachelor, be offered, perfectly fairly in social terms, an apartment on the twentieth storey of a multi-storey block. Even if he is in a position to sell that apartment—it is unlikely that he will be—any capital appreciation that he may think will accrue to him as a result of his long tenancy will be far short of what would have applied in the other house. Even if we take the view that on the break-up of the marriage there might ultimately be a capital claim against any capital gain that accrued—one might be talking about only 50 per cent.—it is substantial and might be significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want to know from the Minister is whether the compensation provision in clause 12 will cover that situation and allow such a claim to be made. I do not think that that was intended when the clause was first drafted. My amendment is a perfectly simple and straightforward one to exclude that possibility. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always listen with a certain degree of relish when the hon. Gentleman, starting from his presumption that everything in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act concerning the sale of council houses is bad, nevertheless finds himself obliged to point to the enormous benefits that will accrue to tenants as the result of certain other matters on which he would rather not have to dwell but to which he finds himself irresistibly drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1002">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
No doubt the hon. Gentleman has been influenced as to the importance of his amendment by the dramatic interest that has been shown throughout Scotland by spouses, matrimonial or otherwise, entitled or non-entitled, in the opportunities for home ownership. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman's amendment would be utterly irrelevant and inconsequential but for this tremendous interest. If we accepted his prophesies as to the likely interest of the people of Scotland, we should be able to assume that so little would that interest be that the proportion of potential applicants who are themselves entitled or non-entitled spouses would be so infinitesimal that we should be wasting our time considering any of the hon. Gentleman's views on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why the hon. Gentleman's amendment is genuinely important is that it could apply to a substantial number of cases, given the enormous number of applications presently going through, which show no signs of likely reduction in the weeks, months and, indeed, years to come. On that basis, I feel obliged to respond to the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that a situation could arise in which the husband who was intending to purchase or was in the process of purchasing his home might find the tenancy transferred to his spouse. Not only might that non-entitled spouse be required to pay compensation, but she might be required to pay it even though she had no intention or ability to purchase the house. She would be in the extraordinary position of wishing to continue indefinitely as the tenant, having no capital assets of her own, but expected to make payments of compensation to her husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, the court might not exercise its discretion as to the need to pay compensation. It is a voluntary, not a compulsory, matter. Nevertheless, I accept that, in general terms, it is undesirable that compensation should be ordered in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment at this stage, I shall undertake to consider the need for an amendment to cover the point that he has raised. I do not want to give him an unqualified assurance that we shall bring forward an amendment of the kind that he has sought, but I am sympathetic to the need for such a change as his amendment implies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting little debate. The Minister started with some crushing irrelevancies. I suppose that we have to allow him his little trot around the political circus. I have never denied that, if one makes a narrow judgment of individual financial advantage, there are circumstances in which the buying of a council house may make sense to an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never judged the worth of a social measure purely and simply on the reaction of a small percentage of people who may find themselves financially advantaged by any proposal. The Minister may be right about the growing numbers of tenants clamouring to buy. But there is an enormous difference between a general interest being expressed
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
and an actual purchase going ahead. The number that has taken place so far is comparatively small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, I may have the better of the statistical argument. But, even supposing that the Minister's predictions were to come true, I do not judge on that basis. There will still be scores of thousands of tenants in my constituency and throughout Scotland who will not be in a position to buy, who will not have been fortunate in their draw of allocation of housing and who will regard this whole thing as bitter, divisive and fraudulent. I do not want to go into that matter. I just did not wish to leave unchallenged the devious and hopelessly flawed analysis into which the Minister had allowed himself to be drawn by his party enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the substance of the debate and welcome the concession which the Minister has given. It is important to that small group of people who see it as to their own financial advantage to buy. Our simple, straightforward view is that there should be an amendment to ensure that someone in this situation will not benefit from what we believe is a misguided piece of social mis-engineering by the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a very fair point when he said that, after all, we should be in a ludicrous situation if an entitled spouse made a counter-application to the court for compensation against the non-entitled spouse who was about to have the tenancy in a situation where that non-entitled spouse —it is very common among council house tenants— had no assets whereby she could meet the capital payment which might be awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be the ludicrous situation where she could not even meet it by selling because, if she sold at that stage, having first purchased and exercised her right to buy, the discount would evaporate because it would be within the statutory period and therefore there would not be the appreciation which would be the subject of the compensation order in any event. And if the compensation order were postponed for a sufficient number of years, interest would be a great complication. Even then, it could only be satisfied by the selling of the matrimonial home, and the whole point of the Bill is that occupancy of the matrimonial home should be preserved and not put at hazard by the need to meet a compensation order. In a very large number of cases it would be an order which could not be enforced and could not wisely be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may ask why he should worry about it in those circumstances because the court will see all that superbly logical progression of events and will not make a compensation order. But where people will be heavily prejudiced by the compensation order so that the entitled spouse cannot have his compensation, it seems to me to be building inequality upon inequality. Where the entitled spouse will be deprived in some cases but will be given his compensation in orders in other cases on the basis of circumstances which are totally extraneous to the central argument, I think that that is a point of real substance and I admit openly that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1003">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
it adds strength to my general prejudice against compensation orders being possible in the transfer of tenancies of local authority houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that the Minister is not giving a binding undertaking, but, knowing how careful he is with his selection of words, I still take it as a strong probability that we shall have some suitable form of amendment on Report. I need hardly say that I shall be down at the Vote Office early to make sure that it is done and to try to put it right if it is not. Indeed, it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate in advance what his intentions are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is clear from the drafting of subsection (2) that it refers to a specialist line of action as divorce or nullity of marriage, and the interpretation clause makes it perfectly clear, if I remember rightly, that " court" is the Court of Session or the sheriff court.

This is very much the stuff of the debate that has been going on for the last half-hour or so, and I do not think there is any need to detain the Committee on it. I shall withdraw this amendment but will do so, as the Committee will gather, under some form of protest and with the clear indication of returning to the matter at a later stage. I think it is quite wrong to throw the whole onus on the courts here with all the attendant expenses, mumbo-jumbo and delay to which I referred. I can only take the Minister's word. I unashamedly have not checked the debate under the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980, but I take his word for it that these were specifically included in the 1980 Act on the basis that they were interim until further legislation took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it was clear to my colleagues on that Committee whether the interim arrangements would be replaced—perhaps the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) could help me—by a very tightly-drawn clause 12 which makes it clear that, unless local authorities are faced with a vacant house or a house where the non-entitled spouse is the only occupant perhaps along with the children, it is, in any circumstances, a case of hands off and leave it to the majesty of the law. If that was their understanding, I cannot imagine that on my side of the Committee it was very much liked. But there we are. We are faced with the situation and I do not intend to divide the Committee on this. I shall go back to my colleagues in local government and to a number of other interested organisations interested and see whether I or the Minister is right about local authority attitudes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it appears to the court that in all the circumsances of the case such a power is unnecessary".</p></blockquote>
This is quite an important amendment which I think will run us over into this afternoon. It refers to the very important matter of matrimonial inter dicts. The Committee will remember that—and this is a very important point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall, on the application of the applicant spouse, attach a power of arrest—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(a)</i> to any matrimonial interdict which is ancillary to an exclusion order,"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
That is a totally simplistic power. There is no discretion.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall, on the application … attach"</p></blockquote>
It goes on, of course, to refer to " any other matrimonial interdict"—that is, one that is not attached to the exclusion order. But in that case there is an important saving provision:
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it appears to the court that in all the circumstances of the case such a power is unnecessary."</p></blockquote>
