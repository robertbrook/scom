<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. As this is an education Bill, I should like to raise a serious point about spelling. Having been teachers, my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and I are greatly concerned about educa-that our sixth sitting took place on "Tursday" 17 tion standards, and we find it most distressing to read March. That should, of course, be "Tuesday".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the correction will be made. I thought that .perhaps it was a phonetic spelling of the Scottish accents that are heard in the Committee.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DUTY OF EDUCATION AUTHORITY TO COMPLY WITH PARENTS' REQUESTS AS TO SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 3, line 26, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or in any other schools or educational establishments within their area;".</p></blockquote>
The alleged principle on which the Bill is based is the extension of parental choice with the maximum degree of information being made available to parents by education authorities. The Government have laid great stress on the need for open government, the maximising of information available to parents and the mandatory provision of that by local authorities.<br><br>
My amendment takes the Government at their word. It says, in effect, "All right, if that is the real principle underlying the Bill, let us extend it to the private sector. There is no reason why that sound principle should not be comprehensive in its application." We are talking about a minority of parents who will be deprived with regard to education and none of us want that.<br><br>
When one reads the draft regulations—I do not know what stage they have reached; I suppose that they simply are an example of what might happen—one finds that local authorities will have a statutory requirement to provide information about all sorts of matters, whether they like it or not. Minimum standards will be laid down and the authority will be free only to go beyond those minima, rather than the reverse. I do not see why parents who choose to send their children to fee-paying schools should not have access, by law, to the same information as will toe provided by local education authorities for the public sector.<br><br>
Let us consider some examples from the general guidelines with regard to priorities for admission. Why should not parents who are thinking of sending
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
their children to fee-paying private schools toe given those general guidelines about how other children have access to them—apart, that is, from their parents' ability to pay the fees? There must be some other qualifications for admission, and the parents should have a right to know what they are.<br><br>
There is also reference to the policy on school transport, and boarding accommodation. Some of the schools are 'boarding schools. The parents should have a -right to know exactly how and to whom the boarding facilities are allocated.<br><br>
At the bottom of page 5 of the draft regulations, it is stated that the basic information should include
<br><blockquote><p>"a contact point for parents who think their child may have special educational needs".</p></blockquote>
It may well be that two of those wealthier parents have a backward child. They may want to protect the child from the buffetings they think he would have to face in the public sector. In order to protect the child from that buffeting, they may want to send him to a private school. They should have the right to know, before they commit their cash, what special provisions are made in that school.<br><br>
It is no good the Minister's saying—as I suspect he may—that if the parents are paying fees, they will make sure that all the necessary provisions are there before they commit themselves. In other words, there will be a monetary discipline on parents and they will therefore make sure that they are given such information. But there is no mandatory provision. Moreover, a school can mislead parents and the parents have no redress, apart from taking their child away when they find that they have been diddled by the proprietors of that school.<br><br>
I turn to page 7 of the draft regulations, where they state that the parents should have access to:
<br><blockquote><p>"the authority's general policy with regard to the school curriculum and examinations".</p></blockquote>
Why should not the parent who is paying fees have a legal right to access to information of that nature? The next provision on page 7 is about
<br><blockquote><p>"Gaelic-speaking areas within the area of the authority"#x2014;</p></blockquote>
meaning the area of the local education authority. Parents sending their children to private fee-paying schools should have similar access. They ought to know, before they commit their cash, whether the school teaches Gaelic and to what standard. They have a right to know about
<br><blockquote><p>"the availability of tuition in Gaelic"</p></blockquote>
in that school.<br><br>
I turn to sub-paragraph (if) of the regulations. What arrangements are made by the proprietors of fee-paying schools for
<br><blockquote><p>"the education of children with special aptitudes, eg in music",</p></blockquote>
or in art, perhaps, or sculpture? Parents who are committing their own money should have a mandatory right to access to such information.<br><br>
Sub-paragraph (g) refers to the "policy with regard to the integration of handicapped pupils". That brings me back to what I said a few moments ago. The parents of a handicapped child are particularly concerned to protect that child as far as they can. If they are to have special treatment in the (public sector—that is something we will discuss later—they should have similar treatment in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
private sector too. The private schools should be obliged to provide ail the information that, in the public sector, the Government are obliging the local education authorities to provide.<br><br>
The authority would be obliged to provide information about its
<br><blockquote><p>"general policy with regard to the provision of school meals, including free school meals".</p></blockquote>
Parents with children at private schools might be making such great sacrifices to pay the fees that their children might qualify for free school meals. I do not know whether there is such a case in a fee-paying school of a child having access to free school meals. But at least some knowledge ought to be available about the provision made for sustenance in private schools, as well as in local authority schools.<br><br>
The same applies to the general policy on school uniform and the provision of financial assistance towards such uniforms, sports and other clothing. 1 cite the case off Gordonstoun. Certain children of a very high social status go to Gordonstoun and they might need help with the provision of their uniforms. The parents, however low or high, should have the right to know whether their children can have free school uniform, £10 towards it, or whatever.<br><br>
Some of the children who go to Gordonstoun are deprived in many ways. Their parents ought to have access to this information. There may be people in very high places following our proceedings carefully in that regard. They have additional heavy expenditure coming soon, although I expect that we shall pay most of the bills. It is important that they should have access to as many sources of public funds as possible. They are expert in knowing what access they have to all kinds of public funds. They should also have the right to know the general policy on bursaries or maintenance allowances. Parents with children at private schools often make heavy sacrifices to pay the fees. They need all the help they can get.<br><br>
There is also all the information about individual schools provided for on page 8 of the draft regulations—names, addresses and telephone numbers; everything except fingerprints. There is also mention of a statement of a school's educational aims. I have heard from many lads who have gone to private single-sex schools in England of the great sexual and moral dangers. There may be a need to provide statistical information about the homosexual tendencies of a particular single-sex school. That would be very important information for parents. We know that it goes on at Eton. We see some of the products sometimes in the House. I suppose that the matter is covered by extra-curricular or extramural activities, but it cannot come into the category of correspondence courses.<br><br>
Parents who send their children to private fee-paying schools will have no statutory right to the information that will be available to parents who send their children into the public sector. That is class distinction in reverse. We are to punish the parents who send their children to fee-paying schools. That is appalling. It is persecution of a minority in Scotland which we ought not to perpetrate. If we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
want to protect minorities, we should protect, as far as we can, the educationally privileged minority. We should treat those parents in exactly the same way as we treat parents of children in the public sector.<br><br>
That is the full purpose of the amendment. I do not see how the Minister can oppose it. If the principle of parental choice, based on maximum information to be provided by the authority responsible for the schools, is valid in one sector of education, it is equally valid in the other.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has considerable experience of the private sector. I look forward to his contribution to the debate as he is about the only one on the Opposition side who can speak from personal experience in these matters. I cannot. I say that quite freely and frankly, because I was brought up, educated in and taught in the public sector all the time, and so I know about the private sector just from hearsay. I see some of the results from it on the other side of the Committee, and I am not very impressed by what I see on occasions.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Cathcart has a marvellous opportunity to make a name for himself today. He has a great wealth of information about these matters to present to the Committee. How did he, as a teacher in a private school, tell the parents how much homosexuality, if any, went on in the school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How did my hon Friend tell the parents what was provided in the curriculum, or whether any Gaelic was spoken? He should be able to give all kinds of information. Therefore, I shall stop right away just in case the length of my speech curbs him. I am anxious to hear him, and I think that my hon Friends are too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Alexander Fletcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) seems to be in an unusual mood today. I do not know whether it is his normal state of mind, but this morning I found myself defending the working class against his attacks. He said that they would not be able to take advantage of parental choice because they would not understand the forms and they would not be able to exercise choice because of their educational disadvantages.<br><br>
However, this afternoon I find that he is sympathetic towards middle- and upper-class families and is concerned about their rights and interests in the assisted places scheme. The hon Gentleman said he had no experience of the private sector, but independent schools do provide information. Although my experience related to two of my three children attending grant-aided or independent schools, I took the trouble to find out something about them. The possibility of choice was open not to me but to my children.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman should bear in mind that independent schools must provide information for one good reason. They do not have a captive market.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
They do not have a catchment zone whereby they have to accept customers. If they wish to attract any pupils, they have to inform parents about their advantages and attractiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, it is not unusual that the Minister was able to solicit information for his own personal case. Understanding his position in the Government, I think that the school would have been glad to give that information. Because of his position, he would tend to receive such information, just as we, as Members of Parliament, when we ask for information find that it is usually more forthcoming to us than it is to the ordinary, standard punter in the street. One of the reasons why we are Members of Parliament is to protect the interests of such people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I was concerned with parental choice for my children, I was not a Member of Parliament, let alone a Minister, but I was still able to obtain information from the schools which interested me.<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central will learn that under the assisted places scheme, which we shall begin to discuss in Committee next week, schools which join the scheme will be required by regulation to supply the same information as public sector schools. That is the point that the hon Gentleman had in mind in tabling the amendment.<br><br>
The hon Gentleman will no doubt be glad to know that Gordonstoun, to which he referred, has now been accepted into the assisted places scheme.<br><br>
On the provision of information and school management, I suggest that the public sector could learn from the private sector. Schools in the private sector, because they usually run on a tight budget, must have an efficient administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. We are not debating school management. It is not one of the areas that my hon Friend spoke about in his remarks. We are here today because the Minister has been filibustering and the procedures of the Committee have been held up by his verbosity. We would like to think that your chairmanship will enable us to make good progress, and that we shall not go down the highways and byways of Scottish education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the hope expressed by the hon Gentleman. The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) went fairly wide in his amendment, and I have not yet heard anything which was out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that school management is the means by which information is provided to parents. If schools are managed properly, the information will be available and published, so that parents can make the choice of school. That is the point behind the amendment. If the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire will read the words that his hon Friend has on the Order Paper, he will see why the questions of providing information and the management of schools are important.<br><br>
The hon Member for Fife, Central raised a point
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
on school meals and transport under the assisted places scheme. These will be discussed when we reach clause 5. The hon Gentleman's amendment is not appropriate, for the reasons that I have given, and I ask him to seek to withdraw it. If he presses it, I ask my hon Friends to resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is yet another example of the Government's double standards. They are prepared to require one piece of information from local authorities, and for the private sector they provide only assistance and financial support. We like to think of ourselves as the party of one nation, and on occasions we shall seek to ensure that the rich are protected against their own follies. We certainly do not consider that the rich should be denied the right to (full information. I do not share the Under-Secretary's confidence with regard to the prospectuses provided by the fee-paying sector.<br><br>
I am pleased to hear that the hon Gentleman has taken on board the point that some of us made on Second Reading, that at that time there was no indication from the Minister that schools under the assisted places scheme would be required to provide information about what went on within their establishments.<br><br>
We are grateful that that step has been taken. But there will be many other schools outside the ambit of the assisted places scheme—in many instances because they meet only the minimal standards of educational provision required by the Scottish education department. Consequently, there is probably an even greater need that such schools, which are outside the assisted places scheme, should be required to publish the information which other schools will have to produce.<br><br>
In preparation for the Bill I spent some time in the Reading Room going through the yearbooks of the public schools associations, in which there are many advertisements for, and descriptions of, the activities of these schools. But in most instances they are nothing like as comprehensive as the information to be required of local authority schools. The private schools' information would probably be about their tradition in rugby, the fact that they played lacrosse or were used as a basis for Frank Richards's books.<br><br>
If there is to be freedom of information for those who choose to send their children to the State sector, it should equally be provided for the private sector. We are pleased that the Minister has seen fit to impose a requirement on schools operating the assisted places scheme, if it ever gets off the ground. We have grave doubts whether the Minister will be able to get that part of the legislation through. We know that there are one or two populists on the Government Benches who may well feel the need to oppose the Government, as they have done already this week, or withdraw their support. So we wait with some anticipation for those individuals to protect the rights of the Scottish community at large, as they have seen fit to do over petrol prices and the like. We wish to press the amendment, because if there are to be parental rights there should be a requirement on the private sector of education to reciprocate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
I remember the tenants' charter, which was the previous piece of "liberating" legislation from the Government. When we asked at that time for controls to be placed on private landlords, and that people in the private rented sector should be allowed to buy their properties, we were told that that was not within the Bill's ambit or the Government's concern. It is all right for people to have access to information in the public sector, but if they are foolish enough—which is what the Government are saying—to pay fees, they can be conned because adequate information will not be provided.<br><br>
Conservative Members who have quoted the Scottish Consumer Council in our debate have surprisingly not chosen to take on board the council's view that all consumers should be protected and given a degree of information. We are saying that what is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander. So we have no hesitation in pressing the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) invited me to speak. He asked me to advise him. This morning the Minister suggested that I was an adviser to the Committee rather than a member of it. I hope that between them they will find me a salary on top of my present one to encourage me to give my full worth to the Committee by making sure that I am adequately rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon Gentleman is now soliciting an extra salary, will he note that I have not, so far, asked him to be my adviser?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect and knowing the state of the hon Gentleman's party, I doubt if it could raise enough money to finance me.<br><br>
I do not intend to start indulging in a long speech, although I shall be delighted to do so later on the subject of the assisted places scheme. My experience was limited to one day school, where homosexuality tends not to be so high—although it was a single-sex school—as at the boarding schools that some people attended. Despite what the Minister said on Second Reading, my own educational experience at school was not in a private school but in a State school in England. <i>[Interruption.]</i> At that time there were no non-selective schools, although it now is a completely comprehensive school. I accept that it was in the English system. The hon Gentleman is perhaps the only one to whom I feel that I should apologise.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
As regards my hon Friend's amendment, he and the Minister have limited their remarks almost entirely to the private sector. But a reading of the amendment will show that it is not limited to the private sector. It contains the phrase <br><blockquote><p>"or other … educational establishments in their area"</p></blockquote>.
Presumably that includes further education colleges, universities and colleges of education—not that there will be many of those left. Therefore, this informa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
tion should rightly be provided for parents and students of all categories. I hope that the Minister will see the amendment as being related not to only one type of educational establishment but to a large number, dealing with many organisations.<br><br>
I support my hon Friend's amendment in two specific respects in terms of the private sector. Its schools are covered by the law and are not independent and able to do exactly as they please. To begin with, many of them are, quite wrongly, granted charitable status. If they are granted such status, in my view the public and parents who send their children to them have an absolute right to know how they qualify—what it is about them that is charitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has made the point that some of the schools have charitable status. That means that they have access to subsidised butter from the EEC. Should not that information be available to parents? Gordonstoun has subsidised butter. That should be valuable information for parents who consider sending their children to Gordonstoun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having charitable status means that parents are being subsidised out of State money, because others have to pay taxes, as those parents do not pay them, and that means that the schools are under the law. But they are also under the law in that they have to be inspected if they wish to be part of the examination system of the country in which they operate. Most do wish to be part of that examination system and have to be inspected by the inspectors. Most are part of one or the other. They do not provide their own examination system. If they participate in the State's system of examinations, they are covered by inspections. If, therefore, they are covered because they participate in an examination system, which means that to some extent they receive a minor subsidy from the State, they ought to be covered by the law, as other schools are. I will, therefore, vote for my hon Friend's amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

The amendment is self-explanatory. We believe that if we are to have these regulations, they should not take the form of secondary legislation which

never sees the light of day and which is issued by ministerial diktat. The House should have an opportunity to discuss them, and the other place should also be allowed to consider the matter, in view of its expertise. We think that it is undesirable for a Government to be able to get away with legislation without presenting it to the House, and we hope that the amendment will be accepted so that the House can scrutinise the regulations that will be brought forward if the Bill is passed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon Gentleman that the regulations are of some significance, as they enable the Secretary of State to prescribe the matters to which the education authority must give publicity to assist parents when considering which school they want their children to attend. But I am astonished that anyone should suggest that those regulations should be subject to affirmative resolution. There are many statutory instruments that are of greater importance than these, and it could be argued that there must be thousands that are of equal importance.<br><br>
If the hon Gentleman wished to create a logjam, not simply in Committee but throughout Parliament, he could pursue his argument for many other items of parliamentary business. As we have already indicated, the actions that we have taken, the consultative documents that we have produced and our consultations with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and other bodies all ensure that the regulations have received a large measure of agreement and consent from those involved in education outside the House before they were considered in Committee. Incidentally, I interrupt my response to say that today we tabled the consultative paper on regulations relating to appeal committees, which I hope will assist Committee members. Therefore, I believe that the hon Gentleman's suggestion is unnecessary as well as impractical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point about the wide-ranging consultations. As we said this morning—we have not yet had an opportunity to read our remarks—virtually every part of the regulations is acceptable, except for the section relating to examination results. I believe that not one professional educational body in Scotland is prepared to support that particular section. That is the only controversial point in respect of the consultations, and we therefore believe that the House must have an opportunity to debate the subject. We recognise that that would take up the time of the House, but it is not our job in Committee to consider the procedures of the House. That is the responsibility of others.<br><br>
Many of us feel that there is far too much legislation, which gives Ministers the right to pull fast ones if they wish. The record of this Government on procedural legerdemain is probably without parallel in modern parliamentary history. We are not prepared 'to trust the Government to bring out regulations that will in any way impinge on the rights or (responsibilities of individuals, and we therefore insist that the matter be put to the vote.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This a matter which has exercised the minds of members of the Committee, the House of Commons and the general public. There are grave misgivings about the possible misuse that could arise from publication of examination results. One accepts the principle of maximising the information available to all parents—.including those in the private sector. The Government's argument is that if the results are published that will not happen in isolation, but will be part of a general picture of a school's quality and standards or of those of an education authority's provision.<br><br>
However, I fear that some members of the press who are hostile to their authority's political affiliations might misuse the information and publish it in the form of a league table. It is no use the hon Gentleman's shaking his head; it happens. But that, of itself, is no reason why the information should not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
be published. I accept that. But if I were convinced that the Government would insist, first, on a complete overhaul and reconsideration of the whole examination system and, secondly, that a local authority would not be allowed to publish examination results in isolation from other considerations, I should be much happier about the matter.<br><br>
There is a voluminous amount of information in the Library which shows that misgivings are not about the availability of examination results, as such, but about the extent to which they could be misinterpreted and misused by irresponsible people—and perhaps misunderstood by parents. A school does not exist primarily to churn out people with O-levels and A-levels, and so on. The exercise is much more rounded than that.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
If parents were to look only at examination results the education system would suffer. I should like to quote one or two examples of the opinions that have been expressed in certain papers—some of them responsible daily newspapers with an education interest. I shall quote from an article in <i>The Guardian</i> on 17 February. The article was—quite fairly—headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"Exam results are no guilty secret"</p></blockquote>.
The article was about England, but it applies equally well to Scotland. It began:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our Education Secretary, Mr. Mark Carlisle, is not known to be a devotee of Alexander Pope, but a line from that poet's Essay on Criticism might usefully be embroidered in a sampler to brighten the Minister's office. 'Some are bewildered in the maze of schools'".</p></blockquote>
The article continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"it is to guide parents through such a maze that the Government is to introduce regulations requiring schools to publish their exam results from 1982."</p></blockquote>
That applies equally to the Scottish Office. Clearly, there is to be a mandatory instruction to the local authorities to publish the examination results. According to <i>The Guardian:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a move likely to meet continued opposition from an education establishment which has fought hard against such a reform in the past. The National Association of Head Teachers has said that publishing exam results would result in a kind of perpetual cup-tie competition; it would produce crude league tables, and would make exam results virtually the only criterion by which schools would be judged. The figures would lend themselves to mischievous interpretation and comparisons which would harm many good schools."</p></blockquote>
But <i>The Guardian entered the caveat:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"Or so the argument goes."</p></blockquote>
One knows What the argument is. One knows what dangers are inherent in the publication of those exam results, and how they may be misinterpreted and misused by 'the newspapers, the other media and even the parents themselves. The article continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"if publication is pushed through in a vacuum, without any reform of the exam system itself, schools will become more and more obsessed by a system whose deficiencies have been acknowledged for years."</p></blockquote>
If this proposal is carried through without regard to other considerations, it will almost certainly do more harm than good. The presumption is that the exam results are a faultless guide and prove convincingly the merit or lack of merit of the child who passes or fails the examination. It is assumed that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
the examiners themselves are infallible, whereas one knows that they are not.<br><br>
One article showed that the people who marked the papers for the Cambridge O-levels in English literature or physics were being paid a derisory figure of about £3 an hour. Being paid on a piece-time rate, they get through as many .papers as they can. A difference of three or four marks could depend upon whether the marker had had too much to drink or was under the weather, or—'for there is no control over when he does the work—is working at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>
The fallibility of the examination system is a strong argument for not publishing the results in isolation. The Government should make sure that they are not published in isolation, and that the results of a particular class in a particular school are not published. What should be provided is the overall result or record of a school. The examination results are but a part of that, and not necessarily the most important part.<br><br>
The Government referred to league tables in Cmnd. 6869 dated July 1977 and entitled "Education in Scotland". It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"But 'league tables' of school performance based on examination or standardised test results in isolation can be seriously misleading because they fail to take account of other important factors such as the wide differences between school catchment areas."</p></blockquote>
As far as I can understand it from the draft regulations, not nearly enough attention is being paid to those social and environmental factors in which a school operates.
I turn directly to an article in <i>Education,</i> published on 7 December 1979, where the consumer's viewpoint was given by Dr. Eric Midwinter, the chairman of the Advisory Centre for Education and the education spokesman for the National Consumer Council. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"To be or not to be published: that is the question about examination results, and it is not a complete enough question … It is misleading to publish exam results baldly. Of course, if you don't publish them it is a piece of valuable information kept back from the public".</p></blockquote>
I agree with that, although the amendment does not make the position clear. It is simply a peg on which to hang the argument.<br><br>
The article refers later to the National Union of Teachers. I am a member of that union, not of the EIS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is a "NUT".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if that pleases the hon Gentleman's mind—that is his level. The article states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The National Union of Teachers are right; schools are not 'crammers' and they should be judged other than on exam results. The exam results should be explained, and then they should be put in the context of the whole school: hence the annual prospectus, describing all that a school does and offers … it is a question of enabling the public to make proper judgments."</p></blockquote>
The article emphasised the need to include detailed references on social factors in the prospectus. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"One way of indicating how this social factor affects matters is to look at the social composition of a population—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
how many of its parents are 'professional and managerial' types as opposed to manual and unskilled workers, and what level of education they themselves had."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we are getting into deep waters. If education authorities must provide not only exam results but the breakdown of the social divisions of children's parents as between managerial staff, professional staff, manual workers, semi-skilled workers and so on, it will be a massive operation for local education authorities.<br><br>
The article states that that is only a guideline, not an authoritative piece of analysis, but it is a signpost to the kinds of income, housing, health, environment and so on which make a child tick. Anyone who has had the remotest contact with the education system knows how much a child's behaviour in school can be influenced by all kinds of factors inside and outside the home. A child is influenced by parental attitude towards education and the facilities that he is encouraged to use, such as public libraries, museums or whatever the cultural facilities, if any, are in his community. Many factors can have a decisive influence in the examination results obtained in a particular school.<br><br>
I remember the English junior Minister making great play of the examination results of two areas in the North-West—I think Sandwell and Stockport. The article refers particularly to those two areas. Anyone who knows of the violent division between the social classes in those areas would know that to pretend that the areas are in any way comparable in terms of income and social status is nonsense. But the Minister chose to produce the examination results and show how vastly superior they were in one area, without making reference to the social and environmental disadvantages of the other areas. That is the danger. Unless we get this right and there is a fully comprehensive picture of the environment in which a school operates, there will be gross distortions of the value of one school against another.<br><br>
I could go on at length, as I have a whole lot of quotations here, but I hope that I have quoted enough to show that the problem will not be solved by the kind of treatment proposed in the Bill. I do not know Whether a Royal Commission would be appropriate, but a high-powered commission should examine the whole method by which we assess educational values in Scotland and elsewhere. One of the articles says that in its examination system Britain is an undeveloped country. We are nowhere like as advanced as other Western countries in gearing our examination system to the requirements of our modern society.<br><br>
The Government are trying to put the cart before the horse and deal with the problem before making absolutely certain that the examination system is geared to the requirements of society. We ought increasingly to regard education not as something that happens only between the ages of 5 and 16, but as a lifetime process.<br><br>
There have been Members of the House—including Winston Churchill—whose school records were not all that impressive, but who later made the grade. We ought not to pay much attention to examination results at school or even university level. People
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
develop long after they have passed school exams or obtained their university degrees.<br><br>
One of the most impressive social experiments in Britain since the war has been the Open University. That is precisely because it has given people who have not been able to shine or show what they were made of at school, or even university, the opportunity to take courses later in the Open University. I hope that the Minister will treat this problem with the seriousness that it deserves and with which I have dealt with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will tell my hon Friend, in regard to the need for a high-level inquiry into the examination system in Scotland, that the Dunning committee did exactly that. But, of course, Dunning did nothing of the sort. It considered the examination system purely for 16-year-olds. It made no other assessment at all. One of its greatest weaknesses was that it made no attempt to make any recommendations on what should happen at the higher certificate level, after O-level.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the Dunning report before me.<br><br>
I end with the proposition that the Committee treat this matter carefully and seriously. I hope that the Minister will make the appropriate noises about the need to get a rounded picture of a school. When the regulations are published and the local education authority is under mandatory obligation to publish, it should publish the results not only for individual schools but for all schools under it. It is of no advantage to publish examination results for one school unless comparable information is provided about the environment in which the school operates. If that is not done, a grossly unfair and distorted picture will emerge.<br><br>
Moreover, that will lead to some kind of educational apartheid, because if a school shows up badly in examination results parents might be inclined to think "We will not send our children to that school." They will send them to other schools, and there will be a build-up of schools that are avoided by parents for quite the wrong reasons, which would be a great disadvantage to the education system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important debate. I agree with the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that it is vital that parents have a rounded picture of the school as a whole and know of its performance.<br><br>
I also draw the hon Member's attention to the fact that in recent years fewer and fewer of the children of blue collar workers have attended universities, a fact which must surely be of concern to Opposition Members. They who claim to care for the working people of this country should show genuine concern over why, although the percentage of the gross national product that is given to education has been doubled in the past 30 years, fewer working-class children go on to universities. That causes me concern, because it means that we are not getting the best of our young people into universities. I refuse to believe that the best people come from a specific class. I feel that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
come from all classes. We should therefore consider this point.<br><br>
By what criteria does a parent judge a school? I suggest that one of the things that a parent must examine, especially if he has a talented child with an aptitude for mathematics, science or music, is a record of results obtained in those subjects in the school, to decide whether that natural aptitude will be encouraged and fulfilled. That is particularly important for a working parent, whose resources are no doubt limited, so that he must look carefully at what is available for his child and make the best of what is going.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt the hon Gentleman so early in his speech, but I think that he is going down the path which suggests that parents of Scottish children should give their children tests, and, depending on the results, should send them to St. Joseph's, St. Michael's St. Peter's and St. Paul's, St. Andrew's and so on, because those schools come out best in the results for mathematics, English, history and music. That is nonsense. The hon Member should be concerned to ensure that all schools have adequate provision, including books and teachers, both of which are lacking in the area which the hon Member represents, to ensure that there is no discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting intervention which made me realise how difficult it must be to sit on the Opposition Benches. If one takes an interest in one's child, one knows whether he is showing an aptitude; there is something odd about a parent who does not. That is my experience of parenthood. 1 also know when my child has little or no aptitude for something.<br><br>
It is important to realise that teachers are not necessarily achieving satisfactory results. If a school consistently fails to produce good results in science or mathematics, for example, parents should know that. Clearly, there is a problem at that school. It has nothing to do with staffing levels, but has to do with the ability to teach and communicate effectively. Being in front of a class need not make somebody a teacher; what is required are the qualities to communicate adequately with the children. Anyone who has taught—there are many former teachers among the Opposition—knows that teaching qualifications do not necessarily make for a good teacher, but what does is something that is inside the teacher himself. That is vital. It is also vital that the information is made available to all parents, so that they can make their own assessments. I agree with the hon Member for Fife, Central that such assessment must be taken in the round—that is, as a whole. But we must not overlook the fact that, if a school is consistently failing in a certain subject, that must be stated, and something must be done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) has dealt comprehensively with amendment No. 48, which covers the publication of examination results. I should like to refer to the other three amend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
ments in the group. I shall take them in reverse order and mention first amendment No. 70.<br><br>
We have heard a lot from both sides of the Committee about freedom. One basic freedom should be that of information. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that parents, and pupils over the age of 16, have a right of access to the progress record for each pupil that must be kept under regulation 10 of the Schools General Scotland Regulations 1975 and to any other relevant information that the school may hold.<br><br>
A great deal has also been said about parental involvement. Both sides of the Committee are in agreement with the principle that parents should be closely concerned with and involved in the education of their children. But if they are deprived of the right of access to information about their children's educational progress and attainment—and perhaps about their difficulties—that is most undesirable. There can be no justification for any school to withhold such information from parents. A pupil over 16 should have the same right of access, too.<br><br>
It is important to remember that someone's progress record can follow him not just through his educational career but throughout his life. It can affect employment opportunities, and not just when he leaves school. If a future employer copied something that the school had written, that could act to somebody's disadvantage for many years. It is possible for records to have mistakes in them, and anyone with access to them would be able to challenge the information and see that any mistakes are rectified. It will be noted that the amendment would put a statutory duty on a local education authority to correct mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon Gentleman's argument closely. When the information is compiled about the pupil—or student—does the hon Gentleman also believe that a record should be kept of whether he has received corporal punishment? Will the hon Gentleman tell the Committee whether he imposed corporal punishment when he was a teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come later to the matter of corporal punishment. I favour access to the corporal punishment records of schools. But amendment No. 70 refers to the statutory duty of access for parents and young people over the age of 16, and to the duty to correct any errors that may be in pupils' progress reports.<br><br>
I turn briefly to amendment No. 66, which concerns choice of course. If choice of school is an important principle that the Government want to extend, surely choice of course within the school is just as important. Indeed, it may be more important. Most parents will take the school's advice about the choice of course. But if such a disagreement cannot be settled amicably between the parents and the school, I believe that the parent and the child who want that child to take a particular course should have that right. I have taught in schools where that policy worked reasonably well in practice, so that it would be progressive to have it on the statute book.<br><br>
Later on we shall discuss the repeal of section 28(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which restricts the selection of courses in secondary education and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
which says that a parent shall not be entitled to select a course in secondary education. It is important not only that that should be repealed but that it should be replaced with an amendment of the type that we are considering.<br><br>
I turn to amendment No. 68, about information on corporal punishment and the right of a parent to say that his or her child should not be subjected to it. On 20 January 1976 I tried to introduce a Bill which would have abolished the use of corporal punishment in all educational establishments and would have made provision for alternative forms of punishment. Unfortunately, the Bill was defeated by 181 votes to 120.1 noticed, when looking through the Division list earlier, that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) abstained. I do not know whether that was a conscientious abstention or a truancy abstention. But I noticed also that the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve)—the other Minister—and the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—the Government Whip—were among the opponents of my Bill. I do not know whether they listened to my speech at that time, but I said that I thought that corporal punishment was one of
<br><blockquote><p>"the last vestiges of legalised formal violence left in our society today … even the most hardened criminal who has committed the most heinous crime cannot legally be subject to any form of corporal punishment … Virtually every other country in Europe has abolished this practice … Indeed, Poland is approaching the two-hundredth anniversary of its abolition … I submit that the use of corporal punishment has a brutalising effect on the teacher-pupil relationship, which should be based on mutual respect and not on violent confrontation."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 20 January 1976; vol. 903, <i>c.</i> 1153-54.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member told the Committee that he tried to introduce a Bill to abolish corporal punishment. Was that because his own experience of it had shown him that it was detrimental to the future well-being of children?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Member for that intervention. If he reads the relevant extract of <i>Hansard,</i> he will see the confessions of a former teacher.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
When I was a young teacher we were sent out of our colleges of education with virtually no guidance at all about non-violent forms of discipline. We were practically instructed by some head teachers to use the strap and, yes, there were occasions at the beginning of my career—I hate to admit this—when I resorted to using it. I hated it, and found it degrading and humiliating, and it must have been even more degrading and humiliating to those who were on the receiving end. Therefore I speak with experience, having been on the receiving end as well as having had to administer such a punishment. When I say that I was on the administering end on occasion, I mean only a handful of occasions, and as I became more experienced as a teacher, I abolished corporal punishment from my own classroom and almost completely abolished it in the department of which I was head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
Russell Fairgrieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Member tell us whether it hurt him more than it hurt the students?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The person to answer that would be the pupil. I meet many of my former pupils every weekend, because I live in the area that I represent and I lived in the area where I taught. I think that my former pupils will vouch for the fact that I was a non-violent teacher. I have watched many of them grow up to become good young men and women who do not resort to violence. I would hope that all of us would consider that to be a laudable objective.<br><br>
I know the difficulties that face many young teachers, because there is an inherited system in Scotland today where many pupils think that a teacher is soft in the head if he does not use corporal punishment on them. It is surely desirable to get rid of that attitude from our schools.<br><br>
It is not just an aphorism to say that violence breeds violence. If a young person—not necessarily the recipient of the punishment—has to witness another child receiving the punishment, and sees an educated professional person, who is possibly the only person with a university degree that the child has ever met, attempting to solve a problem by resorting to violence, it surely must have an effect on the potentially violent attitudes of young children. If the teacher can use violence to attempt to solve his or her problem, they will think that violence is in some way justifiable.<br><br>
I admit that we shall never get complete abolition in the lifetime of this Parliament which has a majority of Tories. I know that there are some civilised Tories—there are some on the Committee, and I hope to be able to persuade them—but the Tory Party has a history of violence. Tories prefer to spend all their money on the manufacture of weapons of war and mass destruction instead of on education. They seem to be quite happy that little children should be hammered almost daily in the schools.<br><br>
The philosophy which the Government have projected in the presentation of their Bill has been on parents' rights and a parents' charter. They talk about the rights of parents and the rights of children and about freedom of choice. Amendment No. 68 is a reasonable compromise which would give parents the right to opt out of the corporal punishment system if they did not want their child to be subjected to it.<br><br>
I shall illustrate the reasons for the amendment with some recent cases in Scotland. First, there is the case of a young lad called Danny McGuire, a pupil at St. Columba's high school in Clydebank. On 9 November 1979, when Danny was aged 12, he was caught playing big after the bell had gone for the start of the lesson. The teacher tried to administer corporal punishment. Danny refused to accept the belt and told the teacher that he was obeying his parents' instructions in so doing. However, the boy was suspended by the headmaster. Strathclyde regional council, the education authority, wanted the parents to sign a statement at one stage recognising the right of the school to give corporal punishment, but the parents refused.<br><br>
The boy did not return to school until January 1981. He was suspended from school for 14 months. That is an absolute disgrace. For 14 months he was deprived of education in school, although I believe that his mother did her best to see that he was educated at

home. I understand that that was the longest period of suspension in British educational history, and I think that anyone who is concerned about Scottish education should bear that in mind.<br><br>
In November 1980, while the boy was still suspended, Strathclyde regional council prosecuted Mrs. McGuire for failing to send Danny to the school without reasonable excuse, thereby allegedly contravening the Education (Scotland) Act 1962. The case was heard at Clydebank district court in November 1979, almost a year after the event.<br><br>
According to a press release, the advocate for the defence
<br><blockquote><p>"told the Court: 'There can be no mistaking the discomfort of the Regional Council in bringing this ill-advised prosecution'. He pointed out that Mrs. McGuire was being 'arraigned as a common criminal for her opposition to a practice which they themselves as an education authority are committed to phasing out'. The Advocate reminded the Court that in every European country"—</p></blockquote>
or almost every European country—
<br><blockquote><p>"outside the British Isles, Mrs. McGuire's views would be accepted as 'unarguable' and 'her opposition to corporal punishment would be treated as a self-evident principle of comon sense'. The education authority"—</p></blockquote>
the advocate added—
<br><blockquote><p>"was taking legal action 'against a woman who, by all said and done, has demonstrated how deeply, how much she cares for the welfare of her child'."</p></blockquote>
He also referred to the requirement in the Education (Scotland) Act 1962—the Act under which Mrs. McGuire was charged—that:
<br><blockquote><p>"pupils should be educated in accordance with parents' wishes".</p></blockquote>
Mrs. McGuire was found not guilty, but the decision appears to have been reached on a technicality, and there seems to be some doubt whether the same result would have been arrived at if the regional council had prosecuted the father rather than the mother. It is possible that the father could have been prosecuted successfully, since it was his decision that his son should not accept corporal punishment.<br><br>
Strathclyde regional council appealed against the decision of the district court and yesterday the justiciary appeal court upheld the decision of not guilty. That was a historical breakthrough. Mrs. McGuire is a very courageous woman, who will be remembered in the history of Scottish education.<br><br>
In his remarks to the justiciary appeal court yesterday, Lord Emslie referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"the interesting question of whether a parent has a right to direct that his child refuse corporal or other punishment".</p></blockquote>
Because of the action of two other Scottish parents, Mrs. Grace Campbell and Mrs. Jane Cosans, that question has now been submitted to the European Court of Human Rights. Mrs. Campbell's son Gordon, aged 11, is a pupil at St. Matthew's primary school at Bishopbriggs. Mrs. Campbell asked for a guarantee that her son would not be strapped, and the regional council refused to give that guarantee.<br><br>
Jeffrey Cosans is a pupil at Beath high school in Cowdenbeath, where I myself was born and brought up and went to school. In September 1976 Jeffrey—then aged 15—was suspended from the school after refusing corporal punishment for climbing a wall to take a short
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
cut home through the adjacent cemetery. The Fife education authority then refused to give an assurance that he would not be liable to corporal punishment if he returned. Jeffrey Cosans never returned to school. He left school in May 1977 because by then he had reached the statutory school-leaving age, but he had great difficulty in finding a job because this episode was held against him by employers.<br><br>
Both those cases were referred to the European Commission on Human Rights, because Britain is a signatory of protocol no. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In fact, Britain signed the convention almost 30 years ago. In 1952 a Tory Government signed the protocol, the second article of which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the state shall respect the right of the parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions".</p></blockquote>
Eventually, after four years of deliberation, the commission decided to refer the case to the European Court of Human Rights for its judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Has the hon Gentleman now made his point on the question of corporal punishment, or is the Committee to be subjected to the history of a variety of cases of which the hon Gentleman has had experience but which do not necessarily have any bearing on the amendment before the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Member. I was beginning to wonder whether there was any direct connection between the cases that the hon Gentleman is citing and the specific terms of the amendment. 1 hope that he will not weary the Committee with any more cases, but will now wind up his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canaran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not quote any more individual cases, Mr. Hunt, but it is important that we should bear in mind the relationship between the amendment and what will be taking place in the European Court of Human Rights later this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment specifically refers only to the supply of information to parents, and I am not sure that the cases are directly relevant to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Canavan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Hunt, the amendment also refers to a parent's statutory right to say that his or her child should not be subjected to corporal punishment.<br><br>
I have nearly finished my speech. I sum up by saying that the European Court of Human Rights has issued various statements on this matter. The applicants had complained that the use or threatened use of corporal punishment constituted a violation of article 3—the prohibition of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment—and that it also failed to respect their right as parents to ensure that their children's education and teaching was in conformity with their own philosophical convictions, as guaranteed by article 2 of protocol no. 1 to the convention.<br><br>
In submitting the case to the court, the commission
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
expressed, by 13 votes to one, the opinion that there had been no violation of article 3. We should remember that corporal punishment had not actually been administered in either of the cases. There may well be other cases in which it is found that there has been a violation of article 3. The important fact, which is relevant to the amendment, is that by nine votes to five the commission expressed the opinion that:
<br><blockquote><p>"there had been a violation of the second sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention: the authorities' refusal to guarantee that the applicants' children would not be subjected to corporal punishment amounted to a failure to respect the applicants' right as parents to ensure their children's education and teaching in conformity with the 'philosophical convictions' constituted by the applicants' disapproval of such punishment".</p></blockquote>
My amendment would get the Government off a very embarrassing hook. I am not alone in my opposition to corporal punishment. I have here a whole list of organisations: the Advisory Centre for Education, the Confederation for the Advancement of State Education, the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, the National Association for Mental Health, the British Association of Social Workers, the British Pediatric Association, the Association of Educational Psychologists, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the British Psychological Society, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Liberal Party and the Labour Party.<br><br>
The Educational Institute of Scotland is committed to the phasing out of corporal punishment in due course, provided a suitable alternative is found. Even the Government themselves are on record as saying that they want to proceed by means of negotiation to achieve the abolition of corporal punishment in schools. As long ago as 1968 there was a statement of principles and code of practice, and some schools and some teachers are already taking initiatives to abolish the use of corporal punishment completely.<br><br>
What we require is more Government initiative. If that fails, a parliamentary initiative by this Committee is required. Such an initiative would help the Government to save face and avoid humiliation at the European Court. It would also save them a lot of money, in view of the amount of money they will have to spend to send Queen's Counsel and advisers to Strasbourg to defend what I maintain is indefensible.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
At worst, we are seen in this country as the barbarians of Europe, and at best we are seen as the laughing stock of the civilised world. If the Government are serious about a parents' charter and about parents' rights and children's rights, the extension of these rights and the extension of parental freedom and freedom of choice, surely they should accept my reasonable amendment; if they do not, they will be humiliatingly defeated in the European Court at Strasbourg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to discuss some aspects of amendment No. 48. Since you were last in the Chair, Mr. Hunt, I am sure that you will be interested to know that I have enjoyed the Committee and that I am learning about it—both from yourself and from my colleagues.<br><br>
I commend the speech made by my hon Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
Member for Fife, Central. In an explicit—but not simplified—fashion, he voiced his considered fears as to what would happen if school examination tables and league tables were to be published in the fashion that he outlined. It is to that aspect that I wish to address my remarks, because that is the aspect which gives me concern. I would always argue in favour of maximising freedom of information. I am concerned at how that freedom and that information will ultimately be used. If it were used in the form of league tables and various publications, it could have detrimental effects on the schools that appeared at the bottom of the league. Like any football team suffering relegation throes, such a school would remain firmly at the bottom of the league.<br><br>
The EIS, which is the major teachers' union in Scotland, has made certain submissions on this matter. It has said that it is unalterably opposed to the idea of publication of any such tables. In its comments on the consultative paper issued by the Minister, in which he invited its comments, it said that the idea that the performance of a school can be measured in this way is unjust. The EIS found it astonishing that the Government were seriously prepared to entertain it. Not only are the Government seriously considering entertaining it, but it would appear that they oppose the amendment, although perhaps we shall find, when the Minister sums up, that the Government have changed their minds.<br><br>
Comparisons of examination results with past performances and regional and national results do nothing to meet the objection; and the suggestion that schools and authorities will be able to present the information to parents in a way which will avoid misleading or confusing comparisons, is an abdication of departmental responsibility. That is the view expressed by the EIS, and not myself, although I concur with its sentiments.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central mentioned the difficulties that we would have in obtaining school examination results. For instance, from time to time, Opposition Members attempt to drum into the minds of Conservative Members that the key and basic principle with regard to educational standards is not simply at the level of the school. Basically, it is a question of the environmental conditions in which children live. It is the home conditions which in the end often determine a person's capability, ability and adaptability. There are many vast housing schemes in Scotland, where there are many unemployed, and in many cases both husband and wife—the mother and father of the child concerned—are unemployed. Where previously both had to work to make ends meet, now both of them, because of the policies pursued by the Government, are unemployed. The frictions in such a home will be tremendous. One must perhaps be involved in that situation to appreciate just how high tensions are.<br><br>
Young Johnny sets off to school to take his O-levels. His father, who has been out of work for some time, is frustrated beyond despair. He may have had words with his wife. Instead of going to his examinations with a clear mind, Johnny is sent off to school, lucky if he has any breakfast at all, but probably with a piece of bread and jam and a clap on the ear.<br><br>
That is no exaggeration. It happens because of the frustrations of the parents, and not because they do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1980-1981V006P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
want to take an interest in Johnny's education. The social and economic factors have destroyed their conception of Johnny's ability or what he will be likely to go through at school. I think that Conservative Members would agree that that would hardly be conducive to a good educational standard or performance by that pupil.<br><br>
On the other hand, there may be a child from a middle class, suburban area whose mother and father are fortunately in employment and tend to have a greater interest in his performance at school. They will ensure that the child is up nice and early, that he went to bed early the night before, that he has a good breakfast and is sent off with comforting words and the hope that he will do well.<br><br>
Those are the two cases. One could go beyond that. There might even be a prince going to take his examinations. Very few princes in this country would set off to take an examination with a piece of bread and jam and a clap on the ear. Their environment would be much more conducive to a good result.<br><br>
It is grossly unfair, when there are such disparities, to put the examination results in a league table. How will it affect those who determine who should sit examinations? The pressures applied to them will be increased. As this will all be reported in a sensational manner by the press—putting the top schools at the top of the league and relegating the others to the bottom—those who make the selections will be wary of promoting someone who perhaps has the ability to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
pass, but who might fail. So that child will be creamed off and be prevented from sitting the examinations, because the school does not want to lower its average or be shown in a bad light.<br><br>
That is quite reasonable. Conservative Members may shake their heads, but it happens, not only in education but in every walk of life where there are human frailties. People will occasionally manipulate the situation to get good production figures, as happens in factories. That is what we shall do—produce figures that look good for export. We shall export the best brains, and those who fail or who are prevented from taking examinations will be the losers. Such pressures are grossly unfair. Success tables would also be grossly unfair to the schools concerned.<br><br>
I have learnt something new. It will be of benefit to Conservative Members to hear that my education is due almost entirely to submissions from the Labour Benches. That is because I have heard little from Conservative Members—apart from the Minister, who, I regret to say, has not extended my education to any great extent. In particular, I thank my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). I think of him as my parliamentary guru, so wide is his knowledge of so many matters. I have been spellbound by his remarks.</span></p>
