	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from column 203]</p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>On resuming—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned, we were talking about the distinction between music and dance and other modes of academic selection. It is good that we are having the debate now, and it is right for us to spend some time onit. One of its benefits is that slowly, bit by bit, we are getting Conservative Members to start making a case for academic selection, which they have not done so far. If one combs the debates—for example, on Second Reading—one finds that no case has been made for academic selection by the Govt. Yet, as we have pointed out, it is at the core of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bad enough to have such a Bill so vitally affecting Scottish education that is supported by only eight Scottish Members of Parliament. The party to which they belong is irrelevant; the key fact is that the Government have the support of only eight Scottish Members on such a vital issue for Scottish education. But the Government do not even bother to make the argument for the central change that the Bill will let loose—academic selection. It is bad enough when they bring out the gatling-gun on the divisions, but when they do not even bother to make the arguments, that is very poor and very peculiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a division in April 1988 on the Education Reform Act, which applied mainly to England. There was one amendment, taken on Report, which I researched. I noticed that every single Labour Member who is here voted on that amendment. The amendment related to the Inner London education authority. All the Labour Members voted and none of them contributed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Member is observant, but one of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point on which I was focusing was not the fact that the Conservatives had a minority. Let us admit straight away that the United Kingdom has an unwritten constitution that is ad hoc, grey, lumpy and sometimes illogical and uneven. Ultimately, it depends on the good sense of people in Government and a sense of tolerance and proportion. I am dealing not with a fine matter of majority versus minority, but with the paltry number of eight Scottish Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Member is responding to a point that I said was out of order. He would be better advised to develop the argument that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
he has made for some time on the amendments before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, before the intervention, Mr. Hogg, one reason for going into the topic at length is that it provides a key to the Bill. A grave failure on the part of the Government is not only that they whip the Bill through with the support of only eight Scottish Members of Parliament, but that in doing so, they do not even bother to argue about the distinctive aspect of academic selection in the Bill. I combed the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Second Reading debate, but there was no defence of the concept of academic selection and even now the Government are very hesitant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Member has made that point on several occasions, and although I should hate to suggest that he was engaged in tedious repetition, I am sure that even he will recognise that we have all got his message. Therefore, I hope that he will proceed to discuss the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For very good reasons, the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) was unable to attend our previous debates, but there has been a full debate of the issues to which he referred. However, I draw his attention to three questions that I posed before his very good dinner and ask him to answer them. When he resumed his speech, he said that we were discussing selection. In fact, we were discussing my question about catchment areas and the choice that would not be given to parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to talk about catchment areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment, yes. I apologise for being so obtuse that I failed to pick up on a point immediately it was made by the honourable Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He talked about a brighter than average pupil, capable of doing well academically but caught in an inner-city school whose provision he felt was inadequate. If I had gone into the matter, I would have made a very long response as I would have had to discuss inner cities and the region, social and urban policies that are needed to regenerate those areas and to raise their standards, especially in schools. But I do not need to go into that matter because it is irrelevant to the Bill, which offers no help to a pupil in the circumstances that were described. It will lead to academic selection being excluded from schools that will be typified by certain social backgrounds:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman relate his remarks to an individual who has chosen to send his daughter to Our Lady & St Francis which, by no stretch of the imagination, is a school in an especially privileged area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not familiar with that school, so I cannot relate it to my geneal argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman said that he read the report of our debate on Second Reading. The issues raised by Our Lady & St Francis were crucial to my contribution to that debate. I do not take umbrage at the fact that he has obviously not read my speech, but perhaps he can say whose speeches he did read?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the honourable Gentleman is not insulted, but I read his speech on Second Reading and still do not feel confident that I can relate that my remarks to that school. An individual would not be able to move to an alternative school, in another catchment area, that would help him to realise his academic gifts if that school were already full. That would be true whether or not the school was self-governing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I cannot take up the point made by the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr Stewart). It is irrelevant to the debate because a self-governing school as such, would not solve the problem that he described. It would be resolved only by policies geared towards regenerating the inner-city areas and raising the standards in all schools. We must ensure that they cater for the educational needs of all their pupils, not just specific individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am loth to return to the music and dance argument, but I was greeted with disbelief by Conservative Members when I said that academic attainment correlated statistically to social background. I made the distinction between that and the absence of such a correlation in respect of music and dance, especially considering the peculiarly talented individuals whom I assume the Minister had in mind when referring to special schools for such individuals. That sort of talent is not correlated to social background in the same way as academic attainment. 	<i>That</i> is a well-known fact about people at the upper levels of secondary school education and university entrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than reinforcing it, which is what academic selection and scholastic streaming would inevitably lead to, we should be trying to overcome such social correlation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talented children who require special education in music or dance should not be used to justify selection based on academic ability. The two cases are different. The Government must be honest with the people of Scotland. If the Minister wants McLaren high to be allowed to select its pupils on the basis of academic ability, he should not be afraid to say so. If he believes in the virtue of academic selection and in the dismantling of the comprehensive principle of Scottish education, that should be at the forefront of his argument. That is certainly the core of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister makes a strong argument for schools to be allowed to select their pupils on the basis of academic ability, even though we disagree with him we shall have flushed out the real purpose of the Bill. We shall at least be grappling with the real and not the phoney arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
I apologise to Conservative Members because I have not said why I disagree with academic selection. I have not begun to make the argument for comprehensive education. I am so entranced by the points of Conservative Members that I have not got round to my arguments. I shall begin with a quote from the speech of the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) on Second Reading. He said.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland has a proud and distinctive educational history and tradition. One of its particular merits is that over the years Scotland can justly claim to have allowed the less well off access to high-quality education." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148. c. 687]</p></blockquote>
He is right. We want to retain that distinctive trait of Scottish education. If the Bill opens a door to academic selection and if academic attainment is correlated to social background, that distinctive trait of Scottish education will be undermined. The Bill will set up schools that the Minister argues will provide high-quality education, but will not allow the less well-off equal access to that high-quality education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Academic selection is the core of the Bill. If it is not, the Minister should make it clear by closing that loophole. It is easy to do. If the Government deliberately choose to leave the door open to academic selection, the less well-off will not have the same access to high-quality education as the better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Minister for Ipswich was right to point to that distinctive trait in Scottish education. It is important and precious, and we need to retain it. If we are to do so, we must close the loophole in the Bill. I fear that it will not be closed, because without that ultimate justification, the rationale of the Bill falls through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to talk about the virtue of comprehensive education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman will not do that. He will confine his remarks to the amendments before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I led you to think, Mr Hogg that I would not refer to clause 28 stand part. The clause is about the possibility of changing the character of the school by introducing academic selection. To explain why I find that undesirable, not to say abhorrent, I must argue for the merits and virtues of comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The negation of selection according to academic ability is to allow each individual access to high quality education, regardless of initial academic ability. We should be geared towards providing the same high-quality education for everyone. That was achieved in the Nicolson Institute - the main school in my constituency until the recent opening of Liniclate school. The Nicolson Institute is well known through Scotland. It prides itself on having one of the highest stay-on ratios among the older pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain that, Mr Hogg. The proportion of pupils staying on at the school after the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
age of 16 is one of the highest in Scotland. As a proportion of the school population, the Nicolson also has one of the best records in terms of pupils going into higher education. I think that even the Minister will accept that over the years, the school has proven itself to be very successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the Nicolson Institute,' successful record because it does not practice academic selection. It did when I went there. I was one of the last of the 11-plus generation. I regard it as a huge step forward that the school did away with academic selection and everyone had access to the high-quality education, facilities and resources of the Nicolson. That is not merely a sentimental notion. Some of my peers who did not do well in the 11-plus, and did not follow me into the Nicolson have yet excelled and performed superbly in their chosen fields, for them to have been denied, at the age of 11 access to the kind of resources that the Nicolson offered me was nothing short of criminal. To turn children like that away from the doors of high-quality education is regrettable. It is a great step forward that all the children in that catchment area can now go to the Nicolson to enjoy its resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asks about streaming within classes. Obviously, that takes place. We do not have a problem with that. We are not being dogmatic. We do not say that children have to be educated the same way, regardless of ability. We say that education has to cater for the individual child. Therefore, there has to be streaming. But it is in a comprehensive school where pupils of all abilities and talents, some practical, some academic and some artistic, get to mix, socialise and understand each other. One great stain upon the country, which marks it out from other developed countries, is our still-ingrained class culture. I should have hoped that Conservative Members would join us in wanting to overcome the great gulfs created by that class culture. One of the prime means of doing so is through the comprehensive education that a top quality school such as the Nicolson or Liniclate school can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tremendous virtue of the comprehensive system is that it allows people of different social backgrounds to mix, to begin to understand each other and to overcome the distances and gulfs that inevitably arise if streaming starts at 11 years of age or shortly after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend realise that on 11 November 1914 Aneurin Bevan walked from his home in South Wales to work at the pit as his dear mother thought that it was not worthwhile to put him in for the examination because he would fail. What mother is not a fan of her son? If that happened to a distinguished individual such as Aneurin Bevan and if selection is brought in again, the same could happen all over again in Scotland, where four out of five children failed the 11-plus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is absolutely right. Research shows that the introduction of comprehensive education in Scotland has elevated standards across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend raises an interesting point. The Government Benches are clearly impressed when we talk about improved standards and extending choice. I am sure that the Under-Secretary is familiar with the work of the Centre for Educational Sociology in Edinburgh, which has carried out a seminal work entitled, "Equalisation and improvement: some effects of comprehensive reorganisation in Scotland", which appeared in the magazine 	<i>Sociology,</i> Volume 21, No. 4 in November 1987. It confirmed my honourable Friend's point and stated: "Comprehensive reorganisation"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Member is out of order to quote at length in an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hogg. The point has been made about the equalisation of attainment between social classes. The study also reinforces the point that there has been an improvement in attainment across the board. The twin prongs of the comprehensive attack extending towards all children, have proved to be a major success in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very important point. In Scotland comprehensive education has succeeded in raising standards across the whole range of abilities. If Conservative Members could produce evidence that comprehensive education was detrimental to individuals at the top end of the ability range, they could perhaps argue that selection was a necessary evil. However, they cannot produce such arguments because all the research shows exactly the opposite. Comprehensive education, practised as it has been in Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it is possible to make the case put by the honourable Gentleman. Those at the top end of the ability range probably will survive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Minister shakes his head, but for the purposes of this argument, I am prepared to concede that it might be possible for people of very high or above average ability to survive and succeed in spite of or because of the education system. However, I am worried about the people who are receiving an education in the type of comprehensive school that stands in the place of the schools that I attended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the average attained, the person in the middle of the pile who is attending a school of 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 pupils and who would otherwise be fairly near the top of a secondary modern school. Under the old system he would have been pushed and stretched, but he might be missing out under the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the honourable Gentleman's concern, but research shows that pupils of all abilities have benefited from comprehensive education. Perhaps the Minister has different research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the honourable Gentleman has read the research by Andrew McPherson which, in the speech of my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), has been mentioned but not read out. Knowing how able the honourable Gentleman is, it is difficult to believe that he has read it and reached the conclusions that he has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confessed in my opening remarks that I was not as familiar with those research results as some of my honourable Friend who will argue in great technical detail later. I have read the findings of not only the McPherson report but of reports from Sweden. Before embarking on a comprehensive system, Sweden carried out an experiment in two school districts in Stockholm. In one, the old system was retained and in the other the comprehensive system was introduced. After the trial period, attainment had improved under the comprehensive system, which was then introduced in the rest of the country. That is a typically hard-headed approach by the Swedes. All the research that I have read has shown that attainment has improved across the ability range under the comprehensive system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman did not recall what I said on Second Reading about Notre Dame and Our Lady and St Francis, but even he must be aware that Paisley grammer is part of the background to this debate. Does he not conceded that Paisley grammar is an excellent comprehensive school, in the excellent traditions of Scottish education? Why does he think that Strathclyde regional council tried to close it and that some 1,500 people wrote to me asking for the provisions in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not comment on the status of Liniclate school and I shall refrain from commenting on the status of Paisley grammar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us put he point made by the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr Stewart) in a different way. He is saying that the Government are justified in introducing legislation that would enable people to prevent an education authority from closing a school, whether it is a secondary school such as Paisley grammar or a primary school. I question his contention. What does the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr Macdonald) think?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the honourable Gentleman's contention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

might say. but we are discussing the Govenment's intentions. My humble interpretation of those intentions is that they would enable the closure of a school by an education authority to be prevented. Would it not be in order to discuss such a matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be appropriate to discuss that in the context of the amendements that we are debating, but I am having difficulty in relating it to the question that was asked by the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), and so eloquently explained—far better. I may say—by the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). We should be wasting time if we were not to have a lengthy discourse in response to that. It will assist the Committee if the honourable Member for Western Isles continues his interesting speech on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Hogg. If that was the contention of the honourable Minister for Eastwood, it is not even within the scope of the Bill. As the Minister said, the Bill is not a means of trying to keep open schools that should close. In no respect were the honourable Councillors remarks germane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that I was putting forward - the Minister seemed to say that he had research to counteract it - was that comprehensive education had succeeded in lifting attainment levels across the ability range. That is a response to the initial question that I was asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the question was about how a school that could not provide adequate schooling because it did not have the right facilities - perhaps it was too large or defective in some other way - could be improved. That is an incredible concern to have, but the Bill does nothing to deal with problems of inner-city schools that may have poor facilities. In any case that argument was about tackling such a problem within the context of the comprehensive system, whereas we are arguing about the merits of academic selection versus a comprehensive approach to education. Plenty of schools in the comprehensive system are under-funded, which is one of our perennial complaints against the Government, but the answer is not to abolish comprehensive education but to provide direct resources for those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that one of the prime merits of comprehensive education is not simply that it raises standards, but that it is good in itself. People from different social backgrounds are in the Nicolson, for example. The sons and daughters of crofters, bankers, businessmen, mechanics and so on meet, learn and socialise together. They overcome the gulfs that would otherwise exist between people from those different social backgrounds. Sadly, such gulfs exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, especially in the South of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ratio of bankers and crofters in the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may feel that I am getting into deep Socialist waters and the sort of social engineering about which they feel unhappy as I an encouraging people from different backgrounds to socialise and to be educated together, even though they may achieve greater academic success elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may feel that if people from different backgrounds want to form separate schools, with bankers wanting schools for bankers' sons and landlords wanting schools for landlords' sons, they should be allowed to exercise that choice. They may believe that it is not for the state to engage in social engineering. The consultation document seems to adopt that point of view. Paragraph 3 of page 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where there is the desire to adopt an alternative style of school government, the Government see no grounds to deny Scottish parents the right to do so."</p></blockquote>
That bald statement surely cannot be the Government's view. They cannot be saying that whatever style of government a particular school wishes to adopt. The Government would not interfere with the wishes of the parents in that school. Leaving aside the point that I made at the start, the parents here occupy a minority on the board of governors, so all our discussions on parents is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Member forgive me if I say that I have forgotten what he said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to remind you, Mr Hogg, but I shall refrain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should feel a responsibility to step in and say, "We know that you want a particular style of organisation or government for your school, but we do not think that it is healthy for the society. We think it is healthier socially to have a different style."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if a group of parents wanted to exclude people from the school on the basis of race or skin colour, I would hope that the Government would say, "Look, that is not on. You cannot have a whites-only school; you cannot have a school for which the entrance requirement is three generations of British citizenship. We are not having racial apartheid springing up in any school." It is a hypothetical point, but it proves my argument. The Government do shirk from social engineering when they feel like it, or from infringing the choice of parents, if they feel that the choice of the parents is undesirable or socially unhealthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to avoid another form of apartheid that the Bill threatens to bring about - a social apartheid, a system where children from a particular social background are streamed off to one type of school, and children from another to a different one. That is not only undesirable and unhealthy, but wrong. It runs against the whole tradition of Scottish education, which the honourable Member for Ipswich correctly identified as providing equal access to people of all social backgrounds, including the less well-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I feel deeply about the Bill, and its introduction of the prospect of selection on the basis of academic ability. We want to avoid that social apartheid, so we oppose the Bill, which is deeply unpopular in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members described the Secretary of State's right of veto as a safeguard against quango-governed schools that pursue undesirable courses of action. I am genuinely puzzled. Why does that veto lie with the Secretary of State, not with the local authority? One of the main arguments given for the Bill is that as local authorities increase in size, they become further removed from the schools. If that argument is to hold water, it must apply to the position of the Secretary of State with even greater force. He is utterly unconnected to the schools. At least some of the councillors on local authorities are elected by parents. The Secretary of State is more distant than the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely puzzled about why the veto should lie with the Secretary of State and not the local authority. I am privileged to have the Secretary of State present to hear my question, and—I hope—to respond. I am delighted to see him, as he never answered my earlier question. All that we got was a decoy move by the Under-Secretary. Gullible as I am, I fell for the decoy and pursued the honourable Gentleman byways and highways and forgot that my original target was the Secretary of State. His presence here reminds me of it. We may now ask him the question I have just asked; any Conservative Member may try to answer it to our satisfaction. Why is it the Secretary of State who has the ultimate veto? What privileged vantage point does he have that would allow him to exercise a wiser veto than could the local authority over moves that a self-governing school was undertaking?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a board of management has been set up and the school as opted out and gained its independence— whatever that is worth—it might begin to introduce proposals that would change the character of the school. The Bill provides the Secretary of State with the power to exercise an acceptance or a veto over that change of character. Why is it the Secretary of State and not the local authority? The local authority ia presumably there and it consists of members who are elected by people concerned - not just parents, but all the people living in the community that will be affected. Surely the local authority would have a far better vantage point in terms both of its immediate connection with the issues at hand and of being a fully democratic body because of the way in which it is elected. It has a perfect vantage point for exercising a veto or acceptance of any moves made by the board of management of a self-governing school. The question of why the Secretary of State should have the veto is fathomless and perplexing. I hope that the Secretary of State, or even the Under-Secretary - or any Conservative Member - will answer that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend might wish to approach the question differently! Does he think that the Secretary of State trusts local government with the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
important responsibility of exercising choice and dealing with issues that affect children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend has put his finger on what I am forced to conclude is the real reason for the power of veto being vested in the Secretary of State. I am always reading in the newspapers about the antipathy of the Government towards local government, but I am always prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt. If they were to advance an argument to justify those powers of veto residing in the Secretary of State and not in the local authority, I should be prepared to try to understand the arguments. In the absence of any obvious reason why the Secretary of State should have the veto power, I am forced back upon the basic political arguments and motives—or the base political motives—that have sometimes been adduced about the Government, reluctant though I am to attribute such motives to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may be reluctant to tell us why he thinks that he, not the local authorities, should have the veto powers. I am still unclear about how far he would go in permitting academic selection in schools that have opted out. I shall give him a further opportunity to answer that question. As I said earlier, I understood the Secretary of State to say on Second Reading that he would not endorse the reintroduction of academic selection in schools. I took that at face value. The Under-Secretary subsequently put a gloss on those words when he referred to general academic selection. Once we peel away the spurious analogy with music and dance and get down to the real core of academic selection, we must question what general academic selection is and whether the Secretary of State endorses the gloss put on his words by the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suspicion in Scotland is that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary are not always of two minds about the Bill. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I was going to say that I disregard that suspicion. If the Secretary of State accepts that gloss put upon his words, that is very serious. I thought that a deal had been struck between the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary whereby the Secretary of State said to the Under-Secretary, "You can have this silly Bill as long as I can have a veto on evey move towards academic selection while I am still holding this office. Once I depart to greener pastures, the ball game is all yours."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend was not here on the first day of our discussions, otherwise he would realise that the real power in Scottish education is the honourable Minister for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Every time he tables a Parliamentary question, the Government issue a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be so, but I am genuinely interested in the shades of meaning that have been thrown up by the gloss that the Under-Secretary put on the Secretary of State's words and whether the Secretary of State still stands by his statement on Second Reading that he would not endorse moves towards the reintroduction of academic selection. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
invite the Secretary of State to make it clear that he will not do so. The Scottish people will read carefully what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State does not take this opportunity to make it clear tha the gloss put on his words by the Under-Secretary does not detract from his earlier commitment not to endorse an introduction of academic selection, everyone inside and outside the House-must draw their own conclusions. This is the second time that I have invited the Secretary of State to make that clear. It is crucial to know whether the option of academic selection is included in the Bill simply as a leftover from existing practice—that option exists theoretically for education authorities—whether it is included deliberately to have a practical effect. If the Secretary of State docs not accept my invitation to make clear that he will not endorse moves towards the reintroduction of academic selection in schools, we must all draw our own conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his eloquence, my honourable Friend has made a valiant effort to encourage the Secretary of State to respond. Perhaps he will now address his remarks to the Under-Secretary, and try to obtain clarification of the distinction between general and specific academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to do so, but I fear that you, Mr. Hogg, would call me to order and say that the Minister will have the opportunity to respond. We would be happy if he would give us some guidance now, so that we may know what awaits us in his winding-up speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will not have an opportunity to make his position clear, so I want to give him every opportunity to do so. His silence is eloquent. As I reach the middle of my remarks, I am more downcast than when I began, because I genuinely took the Secretary of State's words to mean that on his watch he would not allow any school to re-introduce academic selection. From his silence and his even more eloquent departure, I understand that my reading of his words was optimistic, and I must draw sad conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of academic selection that the clause clearly holds is not two, three or four years down the road, when the present Secretary of State may unfortunately move on and a new Secretary of State may take over. The danger is imminent, and will be upon us as soon as the Bill comes into law. That makes me exceedingly fearful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) raised an interesting question about catchment areas. I regret that he is unable to be here, but if he were, I am sure that he would wish to join in the debate. He asked why there was so much fuss about the possibility of academic selection contained in clause 28, when a form of academic selection by the back door already exists. People can exercise their cheque books to move into housing areas that have better schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

is repeating himself. I have heard those arguments several times, so he should introduce new material or draw his remarks to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have repeated a phrase that I used earlier, Mr. Hogg, but I have not yet made the two points that I wished to make in response to the argument of the honourable Member for Eastwood. I was rehearsing his argument to remind the Committee what he said, but I shall assume that all honourable Members remember. If honourable Members are confused and cannot follow my arguments, I shall have to repeat the argument of the honourable Member for Eastwood. The honourable Gentleman made a valid point, but that did not justify a further tightening of the screw of social apartheid. It does not justify streaming schools according to social background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, although it may be true of some urban areas, it is not true of rural areas. One of the great delights and virtues of rural areas is that there is no segregated housing. In urban areas, there are groups of houses where the owners have high incomes, and some way off other groups of houses where the owners have low incomes. In rural areas the housing is mixed; people with different incomes live in the same village check by jowl. So the catchment area argument used by the honourable Member for Eastwood is utterly inappropriate for rural areas. In a rural area, one cannot buy one's way into a higher quality school by buying a new residence. Housing in rural areas is too mixed to allow such manoeuvres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is irrelevant to rural areas, especially if their schools come under the quango-governed status. If there are moves within rural areas towards single-sex schools, for example in Lochaber high or the Nicolson Institute, or towards denominational schooling in Liniclate, or other changes of character that tend to exclude some pupils, that will have a particular impact on rural areas. That is why we believe that parents with children in primary schools that feed into a central secondary school should vote on any proposed changes to the character of that secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members have argued that one of the prime motives of the Bill is to remove the tyranny of education authorities over schools and parents, but if that were the essential motive, a simpler way to cure the problem would be to introduce a further check or balance, perhaps through the Secretary of State, into the discussion between education authorities and individual schools. That would dispel any doubts that education authorities could override the parents' interests at any particular school. Vital decisions are already shared between the education authority, the parents and the Secretary of State, as what happened at Paisley grammar illustrates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply a relationship between the education authority and individual schools; the Secretary of State has a role and power of veto over the closure of schools in rural areas. If the Government wish to redress the balance between the education authorities and individual schools they simply have to widen the Secretary of state's powers. However, it is nonsense
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
to take the dramatic step of cutting out the one element in the equation that has a democratic input from the community. That is illogical and unjustified. The Government should turn their attention to adjusting the checks and balances between local authorities, individual schools and the Secretary of State to redress the imbalance they perceive. They should not chop off one element completely. They should not decide that an education authority should have no more say over an individual school because that authority is still the only way in which the interests and views of the community, as a whole, can be introduced democratically into the equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been accused of being opposed to centres of excellence, but that is nonsense. We want every school to be a centre of excellence, but it is inevitable that some schools will do better than others. It will not be possible to achieve the same attainment or provision of standards in all schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want schools to be centres of excellence, but it is wrong for centres of excellence to be created by screening pupils for admission. That is no achievement. The key is for every school to be a centre of excellence for all pupils regardless of their social background or academic tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate on the amendment. I shall try to deal with as many of the points that have been raised as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The various amendments come down to the basic thing—that there should be no mechanism in any circumstances for altering the initial characteristics of a self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, as in clause 1, the conservatives opposite are desperate to keep things as they are. The present configuration of each school is not simply the best possible arrangement in current circumstances, it is to be the only arrangement permissible in all time coming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedures of clause 28 are a more realistic approach. They accept that certain facets of the management of a school are of fundamental importance to parents and to prospective parents in the community served by the school. The Bill protects those fundamental characteristics; they will be set down in initial proposals from the school board, they cannot be changed in the process of a school moving to self-governing status and the board of management will be obliged to operate the school in line with those characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be open to a self-governing school to alter its characteristics either in its day-to-day management or by a direct change to its scheme of government. Clause 28 provides the only mechanism, and we have deliberately made the process lengthy and difficult. Where a school wishes to change the age and stages of pupils catered for, to introduce any form of selective intake, or to change its denominational status it is right that there should be wide consultation and the clear agreement of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 provides that a board of management
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
must first consult the education authority. Unlike other changes to the scheme of government in self-governing school, an amendment to the characteristics is bound to have implications for other schools in the area. This provision ensures that the initiative for change must come from the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Ministers want to know the view of the Secretary of State on selection or other aspects of a school's characteristics. The Secretary of State will have no power to change the characteristics of a school. The initiative must come from the board with the endorsement of parents. Far from being a centralising measure, this is yet another example of power and initiative at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board of management will have to follow much the same procedures as required for the original decision to leave local authority control. The change must achieve the support of a majority of those voting in a ballot of parents at the school. The board will then have to publish formal proposals and the final decision will rest with the Secretary of State. Ministers will have to weigh all aspects of a proposed change in characteristics, its impact on pupils at the school, and most importantly the impact on parents who might in future wish to send pupils to that school. The availability of alternative provision within reasonable travelling distance is bound to weigh heavily in considering any proposal for changing the characteristics of a self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will happily give my right honourable Friend the Minister for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) the assurance that he sought. There is no question of the Secretary of State approving proposals that would prevent access to a school, such as Aboyne academy, by children within the catchment area of that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am answering a point made by my right honourable Friend the Minister for Kincardine and Deeside about five or six hours ago. It would be unusual for a majority of parents to vote to exclude their children from a school. Were such an unusual proposal to come before the Secretary of State, he would take account of the interests of the children in the area as a whole. It would be unreasonable for him to make a decision such as my right honourable Friend suggested. That is not a matter of opinion. The Secretary of State will be obliged to act reasonably in the use of his powers, but if there were a change of Government and another Secretary of State behaved unreasonably, he would be open to challenge in the courts.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make progress on the points that have been raised, then I shall happily give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need only look at parental reaction to changes proposed in the running of existing local authority schools to see just how difficult it is likely to be for a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
board of management to assemble majority support for a change. On top of that, they must convince the Secretary of State both of the case for a change and that adequate alternative provision is available. The Secretary of State has also made it clear that he would not entertain proposals for such changes during the first few years of a self-governing school. Because of disinformation spread by Opposition Ministers, the Secretary of State stated on Second Reading that the Government do not intend to recreate the selective system and the pattern of education provision that existed 30 or more years ago. That system was changed radically by a Labour Government who did not have a majority in England. They relied on their Scottish majority to abolish direct-grant schools and to alter the position in Scotland, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although clause 28 makes changing the characteristics of a self-governing school difficult, there is no case in logic or in practice for making any change impossible. A school may legitimately wish to expand provision for pre-school pupils in a nursery class, to add S5 and S6 to a four-year secondary school, or even to drop S5 and S6 from a six-year school due to changing circumstances. In the area of selection, on which we have heard so much from the Opposition, a school may wish to develop some specialism precisely as has been done by Strathclyde at Knightswood with dance and at Douglas academy, Milngavie with music. The Opposition may snigger and laugh about that, but that specialist provision is successful and is welcomed by the pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schools which I mentioned provide a specialist facility, and other schools may wish to establish similar units. The units are only part of the school - less than 10 per cent, of the pupils - but they arc an important aspect of education provision for the whole area. The honourable Minister for Wester Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is wrong to suggest that, because the Government have cited those schools as examples of selection within the comprehensive system, the Government's view is that selection for music and dance is all right, but that selection for other subjects is not. It is the Opposition who have tried to define for which subjects selection is or is not all right. The Government will trust the parents, and we shall consider proposals in the context of what is good for the school and education as a whole. The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) got himself on a hook when he was quoted by the 	<i>Sunday Times.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
about to mention the part where he said that he was opposed to all forms of selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation or abolition of such a unit would involve a change in a school's characteristics, and the Bill must make sensible provision for that. Clause 28, with its various consequential references, makes such provision. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) made an honest point with which I agree. He said that he could not envisage a way in which clause 28 could be modified to do what the Government want, which is to trust the parents and to leave the field as open as possible, and, at the same time, meet his anxieties and those of other Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the Under-Secretary's remarks with great interest. What he has said so far is that the choice that he advocates so keenly will be restricted to urban areas. His response to the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) appeared to rule out the possibility of choice within the rural community. He appeared also to rule out the concept of a curriculum whereby each school should strive for excellence within academic subjects. He singled out only artistic subjects as subjects of excellence. Does he consider that his arguments deny choice as he defined it earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. The honourable Lady cannot logically argue the point made by my right honourable Friend the Minister for Kincardine and Deeside that the Bill will reduce choice in rural areas where there is only one school serving a widely scattered community. Where there is only one school, the opportunity to create more depends on a construction programme, not on what we can discuss or agree in this Committee or in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a city Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady fails to appreciate that a choice is being made available to parents in my right honourable Friend's constituency, which is not available at present. It is a choice to take over the management of the one school and alter the pattern of its provision in a way that may be to the educational benefit of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady spoke about internal streaming and excellence. Several honourable Members have said how committed they are to the comprehensive system, as if it were a single system. Within the Scottish comprehensive system there is the very diversity that my honourable Friend the Minister for Hexham (Mr. Amos) and others described as central to the Bill.

It is conceivable that a self-governing school, breaking free from, perhaps restrictive policies applied uniformly across an area by an education authority, may extend the opportunities and choice, even where there is a limited number of schools. I do not accept the honourable Lady's point. From the mid-1960s, education in Scotland placed heavy emphasis on the uniformity of provision within the state sector. Until
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
1981, the Socialists' philosophy meant that all schools served a strict neighbourhood catchment area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should examine the record of an education authority such as Lothian and see what was happening then. Parents were offered no choice of system or school. Thankfully, this Government removed that rigidity. They had no support from Opposition Members who now tell us that they fully support the parents' charter. In the same way. Opposition Members now tell us that they support school boards, having detained us with much argument during the passage of that legislation. I say that with all respect to you, Mr. Hogg. You played an important part in helping to improve the Bill in its passage through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents have also shown that they appreciate the choice now offered. More than one in six parents in Lothian, Tayside and Glasgow seek an alternative to their children's designated primary school. More than 15 per cent, of parents opt for a different secondary school for their children. It is with those figures in mind that Opposition Members should say whether they believe in a return to strict catchment areas to enforce the comprehensive principle, because that is central to the argument onclause 28. I had the distinct impression that the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) was arguing for that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the Minister could have got that impression.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee was suspended, I was discussing the Opposition's view of the comprehensive system. It is true that it has become the norm for Scottish secondary schools to organise mixed-ability classes for the entire first year and the majority of the second year. Pupils are assigned to classes on the basis of their primary school record to create an even spread of ability in each class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder who benefits from mixed-ability classes. Is it the bright child who is confined for two years to a class with an average ability well below his own? Is it the slower learner who is put into a class that is moving at a different pace? Is it the teacher who is obliged to cover almost the entire range of ability in a single class? The benefits of mixed-ability organisation could still be in some doubt. Nevertheless, it is the firm policy of Strathclyde region to insist on that form of organisation in all its schools. Perhaps that policy predates Dr. Malcolm Green's conversion, following the publication of the Bill, to the importance of responding to parents' wishes. The Bill will ensure

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
that parents are entitled to a choice on that important organisational issue. Some parents might prefer a different approach. Do Opposition Members believe that the mixed-ability class in S1 and S2 is also now a fundamental aspect of the comprehensive principle? If so, should it be extended in the same way in the later stages of schooling?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to become involved in a discussion about Strathclyde. But does the Under-Secretary believe that the effectiveness of mixed-ability classes lies in the size of the classes? In many cases, there is a strong argument for reducing the class size. There must also be adequate resources and back-up facilities available to the teacher. In an ideal world, towards which many of us wish to strive in education, if proper resources were available to a class of a small size, all children would benefit from the mix of talents and abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regrettably, the honourable Lady suffers from the problem that many people in education have. She looks at education from the point of view of input, not output.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So education is like a sausage factory, is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be looked at from the point of view of how effective it is for the children. The honourable Lady referred to class size and resources. We have had Norwegian schools; now let us consider Japanese schools which outstrip our performance in mathematics, and do so with average class sizes of 40. Class size may be important, but not that important— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The honourable Lady seems astonished by that assertion. The Bill offers schools opportunities for different types of organisation, and classes of different sizes and mixed ability; it will allow streaming within the school—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Streaming within the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there will be streaming within the school if that seems to the board of management, an appropriate form of organisation. Opposition Members are horrified at the idea that the straitjacket—referred to by one of my honourable Friends—which they played a part in putting on Scottish education may be removed. When the straitjacket is removed, and there is an opportunity for other forms of provision, we shall see which system is the most effective, and parents will be able to use the parents' charter to support the schools that are most successful.

introduction of the primary memorandum in 1965 has been based on mixed ability teaching. Primary schools are more successful than secondary schools.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman and some of his honourable Friends are inclined to make general statements without any support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not a general statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman wants a particular statement about primary schools, he should look at the work that has been done under the assessment of achievement programme on children's attainment in mathematics and he will see that there has been a substantial decline in performance. The honourable Member for Dundee, East found it necessary to undermine and rubbish that work, although he does not have the support of the educational establishment in doing so. There has been a decline in standards. That is one reason for tackling the primary curriculum and introducing proper methods of assessment across the school, including testing in English and mathematics in primary 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the honourable Gentleman, I have no dogmatic views on the most appropriate form of organisation for primary schools. It is the honourable Gentleman who—without any evidence to support him—is telling the Committee that his is the best system and that it has done better than any other. Unlike Opposition Members, I am prepared to trust parents and to see a diversity within the system. I want to ensure that there are proper systems of assessment for teachers and for the performance of pupils so that people may make their own judgments as to which schools are the most satisfactory. It is the Opposition who wish to see rigidities in the system. That is why they wish to delete clause 28 from the Bill, as it allows for the introduction of change and for flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The honourable Member for Fife, Central wanted

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
assurances on denominational schools. Strong representations from the hierarchy have suggested that I suspend or modify the parents' charter so as to prevent parents from having a right to send their children to denominational schools. The hierarchy would like to see a quota of places for Catholic children in its schools. We have refused to respond to that request because we believe in the principle, which we have established, of access to the school. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will be at one with the Government on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the changing characteristics of the denominational schools. The support of the parents, consultation with the church and the consent of the Secretary of State would all be required, just as the Secretary of State's consent was required to close Notre Dame, a denominational school. The Secretary of State refused Strathclyde's request on the basis of the general interests of education in Strathclyde, and I am sure that parents concerned about denominational or single-sex education would have influence. The honourable Member for Glasgow Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), who is her party's spokesman on women, is unconcerned about parents who want single-sex education. She said that it distorted educational provision in an area because there would be too many boys for the neighbourhood schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a simple fact that if a school in a neighbourhood is set up as single sex, it will inevitably distort the pattern of the availability of schooling for children of the other sex in the neighbourhood. That is not an opinion; it is a fact, whether people like it or not. Children of the other sex will have to travel further to their school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Children travelled from all over Glasgow to attend Notre Dame because of the quality of education that it offered. One of the reasons why Strathclyde council was so keen to close that school was because of the quality that it represented, which parents sought out. The honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) came up with an extraordinary theory that went to the heart of the difference between the Opposition's attitude to the Bill and ours. His extraordinary idea was that people's academic ability was related to their social class. My honourable Friends, who are not the quietest of individuals, were stunned into disbelieving silence by his assertion. Apparently the new Socialist view is that working-class folk arc less academically able because of their working-class origins.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout our debate, the Minister has set up a series of Aunt Sallys and that was the most notable so far. I pointed out that there was a statistical correlation between social background and academic attainment, and I used the example of university entrance. I ask the Minister to deny that correlation if he does not believe it to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Minister. I am agnostic about mixed-ability classes, but that is not relevant to the questions asked earlier or to clause 28. Does he feel the same about mixed-ability schools? Are they worthy of being preserved or does he want to go on to academic selec-

tion? We should be clear about his aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions are assuming the length of 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> editorials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, Mr. Hogg, I should say that the interventions are probably of more value. [Honourable Members: "Oh!"] The honourable Member for Western Isles began by saying that he was agnostic, so the interventions are probably less partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman asks me to deny that there is a statistical correlation between performance and social class. He did not hear our debates in the first few sittings of the Committee. If he had, he would realise that we are now at the heart of the basic argument. I hold that neighbourhood comprehensives in some cities serve their communities very badly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. The honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) drew our attention to one school in the Glasgow area— Boclair. He read out the inspector's report. In S4 and S5 the average number of grades between 1 and 3 per pupil at Boclair is 5.7 for O-grades and 2.5 for Highers. However, at another Glasgow school— Possilpark—the 5.7 grades between 1 and 3 per pupil O-grades drop to 0.5 per pupil, and for Highers the figure drops to 0.3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does that prove?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Lady will contain herself I shall finish my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures prove that there is a dramatic difference between the examination performance of schools in the Glasgow area. The average number of grades between 1 and 3 per pupil shows a variation where by one school's attainment is 10 times higher than that of another. The honourable Lady asks what that proves. It proves that when the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden uses the inspector's report for Boclair, which has the highest figures, to argue that the comprehensive system serves Glasgow well, he misleads the Committee. 	<i>[Interruption]</i> honourable Members are very excited about this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those who, like me, find it difficult to take on board general sets of figures, I shall explain that the roll in S5 at Boclair is 179 while at Possilpark it is 57—one third of the size. Yet the number of pupils in S4 who obtain five or more O-grades—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not know why the honourable Member for Dundee, East is not interested in these figures. He is supposed to be the champion of children in the areas that we are discussing. He tries to close his ears to the figures, because he knows that his attitude to the Bill offers nothing to these children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to give way when I have finished my argument. Boclair has a roll of 179. and 129 pupils in S4 obtained five or more O-grades or standard grades in bands 1 to 3. At Possilpark there were only three such pupils out of a roll of 57. The opportunities for children attending schools such as Possilpark—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall give way in a moment. The opportunities for children attending such schools are greatly reduced as a result. If the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is arguing in favour of the neighbourhood comprehensive system that has produced Possilpark, he has a considerable amount to do to persuade the Committee that there is not room for improvement. I give way to the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why I should be so blessed as to be the only one to whom the Minister gives way. Does he believe in the old adage—lies, damned lies and statistics? He is quoting out of context and I wonder whether he will tell us which factors he is considering when examining those reports. There are variations between areas such as Bearsden, which is the catchment area for Boclair, and Possilpark. Other aspects must be considered, which brings me back to what the honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and I have said regularly in the Committee. The Minister is not considering the environmental, sociological and economic issues. Is he condemning teachers, parents or the employment situation? What is he condemning when reading out those statistics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am condemning those people who refuse to see evidence of poor performance or to accept changes in the system that seek to reflect parental wishes and bring accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty hearing the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are finding the facts a little unpalatable, so we should give them a few more about schools in Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Hogg. I asked a question some time ago and have not yet had an answer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The Minister must be allowed to make his own speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the honourable Gentleman's question. First, we must consider the position of Glasgow schools as that will help to answer the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
honourable Gentleman's question. The 1981 national school leavers' study showed that Glasgow schools obtained results that were significantly below those in other divisions of Strathclyde. Over 50 per cent, of Glasgow pupils received no O-levels in bands A to C. The performance in Glasgow schools was below average in each social class group when compared with pupils elsewhere in Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr Hogg. On a number of occasions, the Minister has failed to give the source and date of the material that he is using. It would be extremely helpful if the Minister would do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that that is not a point of order, however, I am sure that the Minister heard what was said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we consider the performance of Glasgow pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. Perhaps the honourable Gentleman will wait to hear what the material is before seeking to ask follow-up questions. Subsequent work carried out has shown a continuing decline in the performance of Glasgow schools against the region as a whole. In 1988, in the Glasgow division of Strathclyde, examination performance between schools differs by a factor of five. The best schools in the city achieve an average of three and a half to four O-grades for all their pupils in S4, and an average of two Higher grade passes in S5. At the other end of the scale schools barely manage one good O-grade per pupil and average no more than a quarter of a Higher grade for each S5 pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the face of those figures, there is no room for complacency about the performance in many schools in Glasgow and elsewhere, and the fact that many parents seek an alternative to local schools is perfectly understandable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister compared Boclair with Possilpark, and my honourable Friend the Minister for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) made the point that there is a correlation between social class and academic attainment. As the Minister knows, Bo-clair's pupils are drawn from a social background in Bearsden that is entirely different from that of those who attend Possilpark, so it was wrong of the honourable Gentleman to compare them without reference to that factor. What are his solutions to the problems of Possilpark? Should it, Boclair or both opt out? How would that affect the difference that I mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Bill becomes an Act, far more attention will be given to the problems in Possilpark than is given at present, and that will be progress.

The honourable Minister for Fife, Central has been at great pains to get me to reveal the source of my

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
figures and I can tell him that it is a paper which was published by the Centre for Education Sociology. The Committee will remember that that is the centre whose work the honourable Gentleman cited as being so excellent when telling us how marvellous the comprehensive system was. Therefore, he will not wish to dismiss those figures out of hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to note that we have listened to another catalogue of attacks on Glasgow schools. I, too, have a paper from the Centre for Educational Sociology. Unfortunately, I cannot quote from it while making an intervention, but I give notice to the Minister that I shall later quote figures for Glasgow schools which show that when social class background is taken into account they are faring extremely well relative to schools in other education authority areas in Strathclyde and other parts of Scotland. The honourable Gentleman's distortion of material is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comment marks the difference between us. Not only does the honourable Member for Western Isles tell us that those who come from working-class backgrounds will have a lower academic performance but the honourable Member for Fife, Central tells us that he has tables that enables one to apply a multiplier to work out what the performance would have been had the pupil's social class been different. That is an offensive view, which is the work of McPherson at Edinburgh university, and I disagree with it. I do not believe that it is right to argue that a person's social class will predetermine his performance in school. What matters are opportunity and expectations in the schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, when there is an opportunity for schools serving certain areas to be run and managed in a different way, I believe that they will prove that by their own examples and achievements. The sooner that schools are able to break free of the kind of muddle-headed thinking which that paper revealed, the better it will be for them - if that is the wish of the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
