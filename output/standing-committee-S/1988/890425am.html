	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish (Fife, Central)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition want to spend time on the stand part debate because the Committee worked through the amendments quickly last Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, difficult to know where to start, because of an article in 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> which is entitled, "Rector launches bitter attack on Thatcherite 'barbarism'", and is about Scottish education. Because the article has caused such a furore, perhaps the Committee should examine the assessment of achievement programme in mathematics in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will reply to the criticisms of that programme, and of the Government and Scottish Office role in it. Being charitable, the Opposition do not wish to delay the proceedings by discussing such important matters now, but we shall return to them later. They are relevant to clause 25, which is about finance, and to clause 28, which is about the ability of opted-out schools to change their characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finance is important. Few people in Scotland accept the Government's proposition that the financing of education authority schools and opted-out schools will be even-handed. It is feared that the complex financial structure, which the Government will have to deploy to tackle the problem, will give the Secretary of State for Scotland and his Ministers unlimited power to manipulate the finances of opted-out schools in order to make them at least superficially attractive. The complexity of the financial arrangements provides opportunities for exploitation in favour of opted-out schools. A set of guidelines, published in England and Wales after the Education Reform Act 1988, tries to tackle the financial arrangements required for grant-maintained status. I hope that the Committee will refer to that during this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three types of grant that the Government can give to grant-aided schools: capital grants, recurrent grants and special purpose grants. Recurrent grants are ostensibly based on a working out of finance between the education authority and the Government. The education authority should,
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
therefore, be no worse off, and the grant-aided school, no better off. There are, however, major weaknesses in the structure of recurrent grants, which allow the Government to provide extra assistance to grant-aided schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the English financial guidelines that grant-aided schools will be able to deploy two other means of supplementing their capital grants. They can sell assets, and although they should apply to the Secretary of State in order to do that, they have an edge on education authority schools in terms of property and land, which can be sold to invest in the capital equipment of the school. The English guidelines suggest that grant-aided schools will be able to raise funds from other sources for capital programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 43 of the financial arrangements guidelines for grant-maintained schools, laid down by the Department of Education and Science states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Governing bodies may also wish to finance capital expenditure for which they are not successful in obtaining capital grant from within their AMG or from funds raised from other sources. They will be free to do so, but the Secretary of State's approval may be required where the capital project would have the effect of increasing the school's entitlement to annual maintenance grant."</p></blockquote>
Built into the English regulations, therefore, are ways for grant-aided schools to steal a march on the education authority by raising funds from other sources or by the disposal of assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extraordinary suggestions can be found in the special purpose grant proposals in the financial guidelines for England. Those suggestions might enable opted-out schools to use the special purpose grant to boost the finances of the grant-aided sector, and to embark on staff changes unavailable to the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allocation of special services and the working out of the financial arrangements for apportioning them to grant-aided schools are fraught with difficulties. If a portion of the special advisory services were to be lost to such a school, the education authority's efficiency and its ability to provide the same level of services would be impaired. Moreover, at a time when the poll tax will bite because of the gearing effect, education authorities could face a dilemma if the financial arrangements are not worked out even-handedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's cynicism derives from discussions with a variety of organisations that fear that control of financial arrangements gives the Government not only an economic, but a major political tool with which to attack and undermine the education authority sector. Cynicism also arises from awareness of the real agenda of the new Right of the Conservative party with regard to both the Bill and the Education Reform Act in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the real agenda? Opting-out is a political joke in Scotland. It is difficult to find anybody who will engage in a serious conversation about the issue. That is regrettable. Underlying opting-out is the concept of "privatisation by stealth" as described by Dr Jack Demaine, a senior lecturer in the department of education at Loughborough university, in an ACE report. He believes that such privatisation is the hallmark of the new Right's education policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>865</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not impossible to find people in Scotland who are interested and willing to talk about self-governing schools. Parents at Stonelaw school, for example, came to see me about the issue. Perhaps discussions terminate because local authorities suddenly change their policy, as happened in Strathclyde. Yesterday it was announced that Stonelaw was not, after all, to be closed, because of a legal loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that active efficient authorities such as Strathclyde deal so effectively with their problems. The Opposition wish to discuss ministerial involvement in such cases as Stonelaw school. We are disturbed that the Scottish Office attempts to exploit every problem that arises, especially in Strathclyde, for cheap political ends. The Minister is implicated, and the facts will soon be given to the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Member of Parliament for the area, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy), and the school's parents, acted responsibly, and that has been reflected in the closure review discussions in Strathclyde. When the facts behind the Stonelaw case are revealed, the Minister and the Government will face major embarrassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has anything to say, he should say it now. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) behaved responsibly. He came to see me and asked me to guarantee that I would intervene to prevent the closure of the school if Strathclyde went ahead with the decision. That power of intervention is provided by legislation, which the hon. Member for Rutherglen and other Opposition Members voted against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall tease the Minister a little longer before we publish the information. However, I can give a flavour of the sordid involvement of the Minister and the Scottish Office by suggesting that he ask his Scottish Office officials to find the first letter from my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen. It seems to have disappeared, although it was delivered by hand. We await further developments with enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report entitled, "Privatisation by stealth: New Right education policy" is excellent. I recommend it for your bedtime reading, Mr. Martin. The question of the new Right's influence on education throughout the United Kingdom underlies the anxiety about financial manipulation. Sadly, that influence is increasing in Scotland. The quotations that I shall take from the ACE report help to explain the cynicism that has greeted the assurances about finance. Although the number of Right-wing organisations seems to be growing, the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proliferation of groups might give the impression of widespread support for New Right policy. In fact, there is a good deal of overlap in group membership."</p></blockquote>
We are fortunate that some distinguished Members of those groups grace this Committee. I shall not name them, but I am sure that most people have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
fair idea who they are. Opting-out has to be seen as part of a wider strategy to destabilise Scottish education and to move it towards the market place. Stuart Sexton, an influential figure in the new Right proposals, has suggested that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the overall plan is to create, as near as practicable, a 'free market'."</p></blockquote>
The idea of a free market in education arouses especial anxiety. The ACE report says that the Hillgate group, another front for the new education policies, "argues that the LEAs should also provide for the handicapped." That suggests that in the future world of new Right education in Scotland, there will be no place for the handicapped. They will go to the residual schools provided by the education authorities. That is disturbing as well as distasteful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ACE report also describes how the Hillgate group views teachers and their "customers":
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the long term most schools would become independent self-governing charitable trusts with control over their own budgets and their own pupil enrolment policy. The removal of teachers' national pay scales, the writing of individual teacher contracts, and the break-up of teachers' capacity for trade union activity are all regarded as necessary for the provision of an improved educational service."</p></blockquote>
The report goes into great detail about the new Right's desire to use the Bill as a front for the much longer-term game of destabilising education authorities and moving towards the market place. It is interesting that the new Right sees grant-aided status as only one step in a much longer journey. The ACE report suggests that the idea of vouchers, which most sane people believed had been sufficiently discredited not to reappear, is being kept on the shelf pending the re-election of a Conservative Government for a fourth term. It is clear that an examination of the financial aspects of the Bill must be performed in the knowledge that, "What you see is not what you get." Parents, teachers and the public in Scotland must be alerted to the fact that, although opting-out is a political joke to most people, it is the start of a much longer journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's neutrality on finance policy is called into question by the existence of the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust, which was established in England and Wales as an ostensibly independent and objective body to promote opting out and advise interested schools. Extensive research has been carried out into that organisation. The Minister, in a consultative document issued in December, and, more recently, in a press briefing, has said that a similar organisation will be set up in Scotland. It may not be called the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust, but it will provide an information service for opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of independent, objective service does the trust provide in England? My information may not be up to date, but for a long time, the chairman was a Conservative Member of Parliament. The chief executive, with equal objectivity and impartiality, is Mr. Andrew Turner, who has worked at Conservative Central Office, and has been an adviser to Cabinet Ministers. To ensure its complete independence, the trust has applied to the Department of Education and Science for a grant. In a recent parliamentary reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), it emerged that it is to receive £175,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>867</span>
Linked to the grant-Maintained Schools Trust is the City Technology Colleges Trust. The Minister has said that we shall have technology academies in Scotland, and so a similar body may be established there. The City Technology Colleges Trust in England receives £200,000 from the Government. The Secretary of State disclosed that a loan of one third of £1 million had been given to that body. Any similar organisation in Scotland would be neither independent nor objective. It would be a proactive organisation, trying to promote opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour-controlled local authorities in England and Wales have subjected parents at schools trying to opt out to an amazing campaign of intimidation. Parents have had the fear of God put into them so that they feel that they would be unable to run their schools. The campaign of misinformation has been entirely at the ratepayers' expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that those comments are exaggerated, but I understand why. I read in 	<i>The Independent,</i> that some such incidents have been investigated. In only one case was there any justification for the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that there is sensitivity among Conservatives on the matter. They seem to think that it is fair to set up organisations—supposedly independent, but fronted by Conservatives and paid for by the state—to promote opting out. But they think that it is wrong for local authorities to seek to defend their schools and the ideal of comprehensive education. That is a double standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 13 April reports that the hon. Gentleman said that he would approach my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science about the alleged loan to the City Technology Colleges Trust. When I checked with my right hon. Friend, I found that no approach had been made. If the hon. Gentleman has since approached him, he will be aware that no such loan exists. Why does the hon. Gentleman continue to repeat the allegations? Did he not take the trouble to discover the facts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to that. Two letters were sent, with covering correspondence, to the Secretary of State for Education and Science. For courtesy purposes, copies were also sent to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) in his capacity as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has checked with his English colleagues, it is interesting to note that he did not tell the Committee why the accounts of the City Technology Colleges Trust, which are lodged with Companies House, show a loan of £325,000 from the Department of Education of Science. It will be paid back when a benefactor is found to pay for the school that the loan has purchased. I have not received a reply from the Secretary of State for Education and Science. I should like to know whether he will say that he did not give a loan to the City Technology Colleges Trust. It will be interesting to know why an
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
organisation fronted by Conservatives has a loan written into its company accounts that is disowned by the Department of Education and Science.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can probably clear up the matter now. Obviously, it is of great interest to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last summer, the City Technology Colleges Trust bought a site in Gateshead from the Roman Catholic Church for the establishment of a city technology college. The money was provided by the Department of Education and Science as part of the CTC programme expenditure. In this case the City Technology Colleges Trust acted as agents for the DES and the commercial sponsor. The sum of £325,000 appeared in the DES programme of capital expenditure on CTCs. It was not a loan to the City Technology Colleges Trust, the hon. Gentleman should accept that. The tangled web that the hon. Gentleman is weaving is based on a complete misrepresentation of the facts. The hon. Gentleman may have his own reasons for doing that, but if he established the facts, he might find it easier to deal with the arguments facing us in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not I who is badly advised. The Minister should stop apologising for the Secretary of State for Education and Science. Officials in the DES or the Scottish Office had better get their story sorted out. I have the facts, and perhaps, I should have sent a courtesy letter to the Minister at the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On two occasions the Secretary of State for Education and Science was asked to reveal what moneys, grants and loans had been given to the City Technology Colleges Trust. Both times he failed to reveal a loan of £325,000 that was identified in the trust's accounts in Companies House in London. The facts are crystal clear and I wait to be told whether Parliament has been misled or whether something more sinister is involved. However, if the Minister decides to set up one or two bodies in Scotland to promote opting-out and technology academies, the lessons learnt in England will be germane. The two English bodies are new creations of the Conservative Right. They are not fully accountable to Parliament and they do not work for the Department of Education and Science. They were set up as ostensibly independent and objective organisations to supply information, but the dossier on them reveals a shabby tale of how the Government try to promote unpopular policies through their own people—by that I mean Conservatives—and taxpayers' money. That is outrageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I have received no formal reply from the DES, but I am happy to give the dossier to the Minister for him to peruse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have told the hon. Gentleman that no loans have been made to the City Technology Colleges Trust that have not been fully disclosed in parliamentary answers. The hon. Gentleman is making a mystery out of nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in the House for only two years, but I thought that when we asked Ministers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>869</span>
questions, they should at least give truthful replies. If the Minister's points can be proved, I shall consider them. The plain fact is that much mystery and uncertainty surrounds those two organisations in England and Wales. If those lessons are not learnt, Scotland will be subjected to a similar web of intrigue and possible deceit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being most discourteous to the Committee. He has made allegations that my hon. Friend the Minister has refuted point blank. It is no good the hon. Gentleman saying that he will hand my hon. Friend a dossier produced by the Labour research department or whatever. It is the hon. Gentleman's duty to provide the Committee with evidence for his assertions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That can be easily done and I shall endeavour to do so. There is slight agitation on the Government Benches because the Minister knows full well that we have the material. It has been prepared not by the Labour research department, but by a Left-wing organisation in the City called Companies House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we send a letter to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, surely we are entitled to a reply from the Secretary of State for Education and Science, not a trawled, half-hearted answer through the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. The facts and figures are on our side. Until we receive a reply in writing from the Secretary of State for Education and Science, the mysteries will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To develop such an organisation in Scotland, lessons must be learnt about what is happening in England and Wales. The Minister may wish to check with his colleagues—not at the Department of Education and Science, but at Conservative Central Office—on why such an organisation uses the mailing list used by the Conservative party's head office. That is a trifling matter, but it reinforces what I have been saying about the independence and objectivity of those organisations, although it may not be very productive to use that mailing list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter. Taken out of context, the financial debate could worry few people. We are arguing that in respect of the financial arrangements, massive discrimination is possible in favour of opted-out schools, so we do not accept the Government's assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Right considers opting-out as only part of a larger strategy. If we consider that alongside the setting up of proactive organisations such as the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust and the City Technology Colleges Trust, that is a recipe for Scottish schools being undermined and destabilised. In addition to the Minister's enormous centralised control over what is happening—aided and abetted by those Conservative-fronted organisations—Scottish education could suffer greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish public must be alerted to those dangers. We await with interest the Government's proposals on setting up an organisation in Scotland. We want to see how independent and objective it
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>
will be and who will lead it. We also want to find out whether certain Conservative Members will disown the new Right's approach to education, which is far removed from the traditional Conservatism of most Conservative Members—if to say "most" is not overstating the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my colleagues will develop some of those important themes. Opted-out schools must have no favours above and beyond those currently given to Scottish education authority schools. If that happens, we shall be happy. But at this stage we are deeply apprehensive about the role of the Government and what may happen if a school decides to opt out. In England, for example, part of the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust's activities is to encourage schools, where there is a problem, to opt out. There has been talk about loss-leaders, and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn has described the process as bribery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are major dangers, and I hope that the Government will consider them closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously Conservative Members are not so keen today to speak in the clause stand part debate: perhaps that is as a result of the opening speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend's argument that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. Unfortunately, I had to be present in the House last night to vote against the terrible attacks on the poor that the Government are forcing through on the Social Security Bill, but I should have preferred to be in Dundee to hear Mr. Paul Scott's rectorial address. He accused the Government of totalitarian tendencies and of being intolerant of criticism and indifferent to public opinion. He said that the Government showed
	<br><blockquote><p>"a zeal to transform society in accordance with its own dogma".</p></blockquote>
In its small way, clause 25 shows precisely that and justifies Mr. Scott's remarks. Anyone who looks in the clause for signs of democratic influence, in the decision-making process on allocating funds to self-governing schools and to education authority schools, will look in vain. There is no democratic input. The clause gives the decision-making powers to the Secretary of State for Scotland. Subsection (2) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amount of the recurrent grant… as may be determined."</p></blockquote>
by regulations will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"made by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3)(b) deals with special purpose grants,
	<br><blockquote><p>"being expenditure which the Secretary of State considers should not be met from recurent grant".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The times … and the manner in which"</p></blockquote>
the grants are to be paid shall be
	<br><blockquote><p>"as may be determined in accordance with regulations",</p></blockquote>
which will be made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Subsection (6)(a) deals with estimates of the grant that shall be given to any school and states that it will be made by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Subsection (7) specifies the requirements that will be placed on boards of management, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>871</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may from time to time impose".</p></blockquote>
So throughout the clause there is complete disregard of the democratic view in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland has no mandate to interfere with education in Scotland. In fact, only 18 per cent, of the Scottish electorate voted for the Tories in the general election and there will be even fewer at the next general election. That is because the Government treat Scottish people with contempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main argument is whether the Secretary of State for Scotland can be trusted in making the decisions that clause 25 empowers him to make. We have had no end of bland assurances from Ministers. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We intend it to be in line with what the school could reasonably have expected to receive had it remained under the management of the education authority."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; vol. 148, c. 631.]</p></blockquote>
Page 2 of the consultation paper that was sent out by the Scottish Education Department states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The level of grant for running costs will be determined so that an individual self-governing school will be no worse-off, but neither any better-off, than it could reasonably have expected if it had remained under local authority management."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>872</span>
Throughout the Committee the Minister has been careful to echo the Secretary of State for Scotland and the consultation paper, and has stated that no school would do any better or worse by becoming self-governing than if it had remained under education authority control. The corollary should be that no education authority would do any better or worse if one of its schools opted out of its control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with such assurances is that they are only as good as the trustworthiness of those who give them. As we all know from history, Hitler gave an assurance that after Munich his territorial ambitions were over. Assurances cannot be taken at face value; one must look at the people making them. I was going to say that the assurances that have been given on this Bill are not worth the paper that they are written on, but the Minister has given us only verbal assurances. There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that there will be no change in the balance of finances between education authorities and self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are practical problems, too. We shall not know exactly what they will be until the system starts to operate in Scotland, but we know what has been happening in England and Wales under the Education Reform Act 1988. The Department of Education and Science sent a circular detailing how the opting-out procedure will operate. It also nods in the direction of the assurances that the Secretary of State gave. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's intention is that the acquisition by a school of grant-maintained status should not change the position either of the school or of the local ratepayers in the LEA."</p></blockquote>
How will that be achieved? The Secretary of State for Education and Science has set out what he intends to do. He says that he will estimate the funding that
	<br><blockquote><p>"fairly represents what the LEA would have been likely to provide for the school had it continued to maintain it."</p></blockquote>
How will he make that estimate? We are told that he will use education authorities' assessment of need, which is presumably set down on a per pupil basis. It will be possible to work out how many pupils have opted out, multiply that by the assessed per pupil expenditure for that education authority area and subtract that sum from the rate support grant. Is that the type of system that the Minister with responsibility for education in Scotland will apply? Will he look at each education authority area and the assessed level of expenditure in terms of that authority's need and use that as a basis for withdrawing from rate support grant for that area the number of children in opted-out schools? If so, it causes problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Dundee we have had a Labour administration in the regional council, only since 1986. We had to suffer 11 years of Tory misrule. As a result, the levels of expenditure that the Government say should apply in Tayside are much higher than the actual levels because of the constant underspending by the Tory administration. As the Minister well knows, social work's assessed need for expenditure, for example, is much higher than its actual level of expenditure. That is despite the fact that every year since it came into office the Labour administration has increased its level of social work expenditure and been penalised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
by the Government for overspending in the process. If that is the type of mechanism that the Minister will use in Scotland for schools, some education authorities, which have been spending below that level for various historical reasons, could be punished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular to English local authorities says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A school which becomes grant-maintained will continue to be able to admit pupils from outside the area which formerly maintained it. The maintenance grant paid to the school by the Department and recovered from the LEA area will be based on provision for all pupils at the school, including extra-district pupils."</p></blockquote>
That is similar to the provision in clause 27. For example, Tayside and Fife regions are close to one another; a school in Dundee might opt out of education authority control and in so doing attract pupils from Fife to cross the bridge to attend that school. Tayside's rate support would be reduced by the level of expenditure for not only the pupils who were formerly under its control, but the pupils from Fife. Tayside regional council would be penalised by the amount of expenditure required for the Fife pupils at opted-out schools in Tayside. The Minister may say that that is fine because Tayside could claim the equivalent sum from Fife which would reduce its funding by compensating Tayside for its loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a bureaucratic and wasteful way of organising and financing education in Scotland. But what about Fife? Who would compensate Fife for its loss of funds due to pupils going across to Tayside? It would lose money but not its responsibility for running its schools, which might all remain within the education authority system. Fife would have to make cuts in its education provision. That could lead to the closure of classrooms, units or even schools. No one has dealt with that prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular of the Department of Education and Science says that local authorities in England and Wales have to introduce approved schemes of local management which are applicable to opted-out schools. Local schools in England and Wales must publish information about their revenue expenditure and capital expenditure, including information about the allocation to each school. Such detailed information is not made available by schools in Scotland. In England and Wales, education authority expenditure on a particular school can be assessed fairly accurately. How will the Secretary of State for Scotland make a judgment without such details? When the Minister starts to listen to our discussions perhaps he will answer such questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular also says that English authorities will have
	<br><blockquote><p>"to publish budget statements for 1989–90 as soon as practicable."</p></blockquote>
The Minister expects schools to opt out from 1990 onwards. When will such detailed information be available in Scotland? What measures will the Minister take to ensure that those details will be published in Scotland so that when revenue funding is allocated to education authority and self-governing schools decisions can be based on accurate information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>874</span>
Can the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Government be entrusted with such decisions? Even Conservative Members must ask themselves seriously whether the Government can be relied on to be fair to education authority schools or whether they will discriminate in favour of opted-out schools. The hon. Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) and for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and the Minister either are or were members of the No Turning Back group of Conservative Members who a couple of years ago produced the pamphlet called "Save our Schools" which referred to the education authority system. One wonders whether they can be trusted with any matters to do with that system. They called it "an impossible system" which imprisons and "thwarts" head teachers and others. They referred to it as the "system of producer domination" and a "state monopoly". At one point they described it as "bad" and said that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"geared to mass production of a standardized commodity at minimum inconvenience to those who produce it."</p></blockquote>
So we have to accept that members of the Committee and certainly the Minister, who is responsible for education in Scotland, simply do not like education authority schools or the education authority system, and they want to wreck it. They have always wanted to do so, and we must, therefore, consider whether they will be fair to the education authority system in Scotland in the way that they operate clause 25. The system will be within their power. It certainly is not in the power of the elected representatives of the Scottish people. They will have no control over the decision-making process by which funds are allocated to education authority schools and to self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-governing schools are dealt with in the pamphlet. It says that those schools secure greater parental involvement, consumer choice, diversity of provision and increased accountability. At one stage the pamphlet goes so far as to say that this
	<br><blockquote><p>"downward distribution of power is not only compatible with the Conservative view of society, it is also very popular."</p></blockquote>
[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] But we cannot expect the Secretary of State or the Minister responsible for education in Scotland to be impartial in their treatment of education authority schools and self-governing schools, because they hate and oppose the education authority system. They want to destroy it and replace it with self-governing schools. One would have to be mad to expect fairness from a Tory Secretary of State for Scotland in his treatment of the two sectors of education. We should seriously consider that issue when we decide whether clause 25 should stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Right-wing group of Members of Parliament also discussed the freedom of self-governing schools to control their own budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pamphlet deals with the freedom of parents to allocate funds according their own views of the priorities. They may wish to pay more for teachers and forgo some items of equipment. The Minister was one of the authors of the pamphlet, so it is interesting, in the light of some of his statements in Committee, that the pamphlet says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>875</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The biggest change brought about in the short term would be the variability which it introduced into teachers' salaries. In place of the current national scale would be a system under which they were determined by each school. Schools might wish to introduce different grades of salary for different qualities of teacher, or to add merit evaluation awards."</p></blockquote>
[Hon Members: "Hear, hear."] Now we have the truth. That is what the Bill has always been about. It is not about increasing parental involvement or giving choices, it has been about undermining the education authorities' system, splitting and dividing the teachers and wrecking the education system that we have known in Scotland for years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pamphlet deals with the freedom of self-governing schools to put out to contract some ancillary services such as janitorial and domestic services. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For non-teaching services, there might well be national guidelines to determine acceptable standards".</p></blockquote>
But there may not, because the Minister said that there will be no national guidelines and that each board of management will decide the criteria that it applies to any contract. There will be no attempt to impose the guidelines that education authorities adopt. There will be no national guidelines unless the Minister has changed his mind again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing two different things—national guidelines on pay and conditions which trade unions might be worried about and national guidelines on standards which Her Majesty's Inspectorate will deal with and which the Inspectorate will still operate in those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister may be confused. As I understand it Her Majesty's Inspectorate deals with education provision, but I was speaking about janitorial and domestic services. The Minister made it clear in an earlier debate that that would be entirely up to boards of management and that no national standards would be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerned me most in the section about the financing of self-governing schools as Conservative Members really wish to see it develop rather than as they claim to wish to see it develop, is the question of the other services provided by education authorities to support teaching. During the previous sitting the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are, of course, other services, such as advisorate services or in-service training of teachers, which education authorities now provide for their own schools but in respect of which self-governing schools will be free to make their own arrangements."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 April 1989; c. 855–856.]</p></blockquote>
The pamphlet that the Minister wrote about two years ago dealt with the same problem. In it he argued that the freedom given to self-governing schools would lead to what he called
	<br><blockquote><p>"significant reductions in cost arising from the elimination of the middle layers of administrative bureaucracy. These savings would stay within the education budget."</p></blockquote>
The Minister wants services such as the advisorate and office services and in-service training to be taken away from education authorities and self-governing schools to make their own provision. That would work only if all schools were self-governing but, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
Conservative Members keep reminding us, this is a permissive Bill. It is not clear how many schools will opt out. It may be only a small fraction, but if they opt out, they gain the freedom to buy in their own support services. Included in the assessment of the level of recurrent grant for opted-out schools will be a consideration of how much they can pay for those very support services. If money is taken from the education authority sector and given to self-governing schools to allow them to employ their own bursar or buy in their own in-service training, the education authority's ability to provide such services will be reduced by the equivalent amount. That means that the service to schools that remain under education authority control will be harmed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ignores the first rule of politics, which is not to fight battles on grounds of the opponent's choice. The fact that he devotes a large part of his speech to what was an obscure pamphlet two years ago—[Hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks me to withdraw. The fact that the hon.

We said that consumers and parents, not producers, trade unions or local authority officials, should have more say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman is showing such interest in our pamphlet, he might like to know that the No Turning Back group is publishing another one tomorrow. I invited him to our press conference at 11 am at Conservative Central Office. He will be very welcome and a cup of coffee will be provided. The new pamphlet will be more to his liking because it supports the Prime Minister in her vision of Europe. It rejects the concept of a politically united Europe and deals with consumer choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting intevention, but I shall decline the offer to attend tomorrow as I am already in enough trouble with my own leadership for the company I keep.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle at least had the decency to distance himself to a certain extent from the ideas contained in what he called an obscure pamphlet. He claimed that it struck a chord with parents who are the consumers of education. He may be right or wrong in terms of England but he is certainly wrong in terms of Scotland. About 18 months after the publication of the pamphlet the Conservative party went to the Scottish people with some of those very ideas and was given a thorough drubbing. Scottish people do not want Conservative Governments and such ideas imposed on them. The tragedy of this morning's debate is that regardless of what they want, those ideas are rammed down their throats by a majority that they did not elect.

The Minister and other Conservative Members have a vision of the destruction of the education authority system in Scotland. The pamphlet spells out that in painful detail. Although four members of the Committee put their names to the pamphlet, the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) did not. Perhaps they were too frightened to admit to it because they represent Scottish constituencies, or perhaps they are out of sympathy with the ideas of the Minister responsible for education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ideas in the pamphlet are a very serious threat to education in Scotland. We cannot trust the Under-Secretary who will make the decisions under clause 25. Those decisions will not be made by the Secretary of State for Scotland, who spends his life looking over his shoulder at the other Right-wing tricks of the Under-Secretary and wondering whether he will be exposed in the Tory party, be called to account and be sacked by the Prime Minister. We know that the Prime Minister's faith lies not with the Secretary of State, but with the Under-Secretary. The Secretary of State has retreated from many of the fine positions that he took in the past under the Right-wing pressure that is now exerted in the Conservative party. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
Under-Secretary represents the main ideology in the Conservative party and he will make the decisions under clause 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the clause is so alarming. The Under-Secretary's vision is that self-governing schools should become not just the norm, but almost mandatory. He believes that self-governing schools should operate everywhere, that the education authorities should lose all their powers and that the self-governing schools should make their own decisions about financing, buy in their services and appoint their bursars. He believes that the whole range of education authority provision should disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pamphlet admits at the end that if those ideas were put to the people of Scotland, England or Wales, they would be rejected. It says that everyone is afraid of radical overnight change. Many interest groups in education would oppose that and no interest group would naturally support the Right-wing extremists who are in the Committee. The pamphlet argues for a gradualist change—for introducing change step by step so that people are less alarmed. The Bill does not deliver the whole system that the supporters of that pamphlet want and does not mean the final wrecking of the education authority system, but it is a significant step along the road toward that. That is what the Minister intends and it was explained in the pamphlet "Save our Schools" two years ago. The Bill is the first step in that gradualist approach, but major problems for education authority schools that remain under education authority control are inherent in that first step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When those Conservative Members preach about choice and diversity, they really mean restoring inequality and privilege in education. When they speak about freedom of parents they mean the freedom of some parents to buy a better education for their children than is provided for children elsewhere in Scotland. The system will not, as they claim, be more accountable to the Scottish people, but will be infinitely less accountable. That is clearly shown by the fact that in 1987 they did not even dare to say in the Scottish manifesto that they intended to introduce such a system of opting-out into Scottish schools. They knew that if they had, their election result would have been even more disastrous; the reaction to the poll tax was bad enough and this would simply have added to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a plea to the single Scottish Conservative Member present—apart from the Minister, and it is hard to believe that he is Scottish—to try to think for Scotland instead of his own party interest. Will he consider the potential damage to schools in Tayside if he chooses to vote in favour of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the hon. Member for Tayside, North does not agree with the No Turning Back group and the destruction of the education authority system, which it believes to be bad and in need of replacement, he should consider carefully supporting the clause. Although the Bill would not achieve the destruction of the education authority system immediately, or even in the medium term, it is one step along the road to the final goal at which the Minister and his hon. Friends have always aimed. That is why they associate themselves with the No Turning Back group, the PULSE group, and all the other far Right groups that wish to destroy Socialism in Scotland—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] The Socialism that Conservative Members want to destroy is the National Health system, comprehensive education, welfare benefits and social security, which a massive consensus supports. Conservative Members are out of touch because they do not understand what Scottish people want. That is why the Bill is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is offensive because it places power in the hands of a Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland. In the form of the Minister with responsibility for education, the present Secretary of State is backed by Right-wing extremists who do not relate to Scottish people's general view on education. The Bill is being imposed on Scottish people against their wishes. It may be said that it is permissive and that nothing will happen unless parents choose to change, but it takes only small groups of parents here and there to begin to choose to opt out to undermine the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is Conservative support in Scotland. If people are not to take up opting-out, there would have to be no support. The Conservative party holds 24 per cent, of the vote and 18 per cent, of the electorate in Scotland, which probably means that some people will be happy with the Bill. Hard as it is to believe, some people voted for the Minister. The Thatcherite message rings a bell with some people in Scotland, but they are a very small minority. The problem is that it takes only a small minority to decide to opt out their schools from education
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
authority control to begin fatally to weaken the education authority system. The strength of the Scottish system is that it embraces almost all children in almost all schools. There is a very small private sector which, outwith Edinburgh, has no great impact on the provision of education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If another sector is created with 10 or 15 per cent, of parents opting their schools out and getting privileged treatment, problems will start for the system as a whole. People will start to get nervous and believe that there is a better alternative for them and their children outwith the state sector. There may be a better alternative for some, but it will always be at the expense of the majority. That is we are so opposed to the clause and why it should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A substantial number of people in Scotland, not all of whom vote Conservative—many vote for other parties, including the alliance in all its guises—are deeply worried about some of the actions in education and the fact that education authorities have not been as receptive as they could and should have been. The finance that will come through the Secretary of State—the grants, the capital grants and the special purpose grants—will be forthcoming only if parents and boards decide that they wish the school to become self-governing. If they decide that, they must be very unhappy with their local education authority. That is the discipline, and it is marvellous how it concentrates the mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few days we have seen how Strathclyde has suddenly become aware that it must be receptive to the needs and wishes of the parents and boards. That has led to the various conflicting pieces of information that have come from Strathclyde and the Labour party. It is unfortunate for the Labour party that it cannot get its act together. Labour Members are concerned because we have got our act together. We have a Minister responsible for education in the Scottish Office and a Secretary of State for Education and Science who know what the Conservative party wants to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is astonishing that the hon. Member for Dundee, East should make such a speech when he realises full well that, certainly in Tayside—the area that he and I share—my views and position have never been in doubt. I am prepared to fight the next election, when it comes—as well as the one after, and the one after that—on the basis that, by then, the Scottish people will have seen the effect of the legislation in Strathclyde and elsewhere. It has had an impact even before it reaches the statute book, so we can imagine its effect after it becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities remain sensitive to local needs, their future will never be in doubt. The future of any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
organisation is in doubt only if people decide to reject it. The hon. Member for Dundee, East may say that that is what happened to the Conservative party in Scotland. However, there are only minority parties in Scotland—no one has a majority—and we are the major minority party after the Labour party. I believe that we shall continue to be so and shall probably improve on our position, because, by the next general election, the Scottish people will have seen the benefits of this and other legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the outburst of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made an excellent speech. He pointed out clearly the hidden threat of the legislation. The hidden agenda is twofold: it involves the destruction of the power, influence and the ability to plan for their communities of local education authorities and, as a consequence of that, the introduction of selective academic education, leading in the long run to a system of social apartheid in Scottish schools. That is why Scottish public opinion is so strongly against the Bill and why we reject the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East pointed out, the clause will greatly enlarge the Secretary of State's powers. The powers will be wielded to pursue the hidden agenda—the agenda of selective education. That is why we oppose the extension of his powers. It is with deep regret that we saw the arguments behind our amendments rejected by the Government, even to the extent that they wish to retain the amazing provision retrospectively to alter the conditions attached to grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does nothing but increase the Secretary of State's powers, and that means that the Minister's powers will ultimately be strengthened. We know to what purpose the Minister will use them. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) showed the hypocrisy towards the use of public money involved in the pursuit of the hidden agenda. The Government wish to tie the hands and the abilities of the education authorities to pursue the community's interest, but they wish to give taxpayers' money to trusts. For some reason, they are called charitable trusts, but they are propaganda outfits which are closely tied to the Conservative party and which pursue its aims for opting out and selective education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the Secretary of State power to fund an opted-out school in various ways. The funding is classified as capital recurrent and special purpose. I shall deal with the classifications later. First, how will the Secretary of State allocate funding? That matter goes to the heart of the clause. My hon. Friends the Members for Dundee, East and for Fife, Central have touched upon that. The Government claim that the principle behind their arrangements is that opted-out schools will receive the same level of funding as they would have if they had stayed under
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
the control of the education authority. That principle is espoused in the explanatory and financial memorandum on "The Financial Effects of the Bill".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have great doubts about how that principle will operate in practice. We await the Minister's reply with interest. There will be problems even with the recurrent grant, because opting out will disrupt the day-to-day provision of services within an education authority. That disruption will have financial implications. Will education authorities be compensated if a recipient of their services no longer requires them? Those services will have to be provided for other parts of the community. Often, that will require the same funding, despite having a smaller receiving base. Recurrent funding raises practical problems in applying the principle that opted-out schools should receive the same level of day-to-day maintenance funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems are compounded on funding for capital expenditure. Although it could be argued that recurrent funding is spread over a network of services throughout the education authority area, and that it is possible to hazard guesses on average and per head calculations and apply them to an individual school, it is not so simple with capital expenditure. Capital expenditure for large items will be on an ad hoc basis and will not be spread uniformly throughout the education authority on a per capita basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools will have specific capital projects, and expenditure will vary, thus making it difficult sensibly to apply the principle of equivalent funding between opted-out schools and education authority schools. As capital expenditure is required for one-off items, which are often expensive, it is bound to distort the per capita spread of funding in an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evaluation of and decisions on capital projects should not be based on equality among schools but on the merits of an application. As every application must be assessed and funded on a case-by-case basis, grossing up capital expenditure is impractical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third category of expenditure is special purpose grants. I assume that my arguments on capital grant apply equally—or perhaps more—because those grants will be made on an even more ad hoc, occasional, idiosyncratic and case-by-case basis than for capital expenditure items. How will funding be evaluated if an opted-out school is to have the same funding as all the other education authority schools? It is difficult to do that with recurrent funding, even more difficult for capital expenditure and quite impossible for special purpose funding. I am guessing about special purpose funding because none of us can be clear what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not here last Thursday, but does my hon. Friend know whether these special purpose grants can be used for capital or recurrent expenditure or for both?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the mystery of special purpose expenditure. The Bill gives no indication what it is. Recurrent expenditure is defined as day-to-day running costs according to the duties laid on the board of management. A definition of capital expenditure is promised under clause 25(4). But
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
special purpose grants, rather than being defined substantively, are given what I would describe as a negative definition in clause 25(3)(b). According to that paragraph they are not capital grants and they are not recurrent grants. It is an odd form of definition and an inept form of classification to classify funding as (a) capital, (b) recurrent and (c) none of the above. The latter category to be defined more precisely than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend mused on this and come up with any ideas about what the special grant might apply to? If it is not recurrent and not capital, what might it be considered for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a difficult question. I cannot say that it is not recurrent. The Bill does not say that it is not recurrent but says that it should not be paid from the recurrent fund. It does not say that it is not a recurrent form of expenditure for a day-to-day maintenance activity. It would be easy for the Bill to say that it is not recurrent expenditure, but clause 25(3)(b) states that special purpose grants are grants
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of expenditure not of a capital nature, being expenditure which the Secretary of State considers should not be met from recurrent grant".</p></blockquote>
The subordinate clause after the comma is very significant. If the Bill says that this expenditure is not of a capital nature and not of a recurrent nature, it could simply say that these are grants in respect of expenditure not of a capital or recurrent nature. That would be simple to understand. However, the clause merely states that they are not for expenditure of a capital nature. Instead of also saying clearly that they are not for expenditure of a recurrent nature, it states that they are for expenditure that should not be met from the recurrent funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear distinction. The implication is that even recurrent expenditure might not have to be met from recurrent funds. That is why I am spending so much time on the definition of special purpose grants—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is an important point. If the special purpose grant is to be used for recurrent expenditure sometimes, why is it not paid from the recurrent expenditure fund? If it is not to be used for recurrent expenditure, why does not the Bill state that as clearly as it states that it is not for capital expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I am having trouble understanding it. Does he not think it possible that a self-governing school might run up a deficit and be given a special purpose grant to cope with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be. There is nothing in the Bill to rule out that possibility. Perhaps the Government had that in mind when they defined the special purpose grant in a way that would allow it to be used to pay debt arising from recurrent expenditure. They have not explicitly ruled out that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would fit in with clause 25(3)(b), which states that a special purpose grant
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
may be given for expenditure that is not of a capital nature but which cannot be met from the recurrent grant. It a school runs out of money it could not meet its deficit from its recurrent grant in any case, so that would fulfil two parts of the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes a good start in trying to divine the reasons behind the Bill. Ultimately, we have to wait for the Minister to clarify his motives. It would be helpful if he described expenditure under special purpose grants because clause 25(4) states that such descriptions will be given for capital expenditure grants. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The descriptions of expenditure which are to be regarded … as expenditure of a capital nature shall be such as may be determined by or in accordance with the regulations."</p></blockquote>
Presumably the regulations will describe a capital expenditure grant. I hope that they will define a general category and not be simply a description of a particular project. If so, there should be a general description of special purpose grants and of their use. The Bill leaves us completely in the dark at present. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made good guesses, but they are still only guesses. We must wait for the Minister's explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, we are worried that there is a hidden agenda in the Bill. In pursuit of that hidden agenda, the Government want to accrue all possible powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my bit to help the hon. Gentleman through the next 55 minutes. Does he intend to expand on the point about the Minister and the constituency of Stirling that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made sotto voce? I am a little worried that that remark might not have been picked up by 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not worry; I will repeat it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) will probably want to speak again later. He is a frank and honest man, which can be his undoing just as much as his making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be on our guard against the provisions that give the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary the leeway to exploit their powers in pursuit of their hidden agenda of destroying the education authorities as well as of introducing a system of selection on the ground of general academic ability, which would introduce a system of social apartheid in Scottish schools. We must warn against the extension of such powers and their accretion in the hands of the Secretary of State, whether they arise in this clause or in other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to discuss at much greater length other aspects of the clause's implications, but, on second thought, I shall wait for the Minister's reply before possibly taking up those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister is absolutely desperate; he is champing at the bit to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>885</span>
speak. I shall try to be as brief as my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), and I might do as he says and wait for the Minister's reply before asking other questions, especially on the issue of special grants, which is a dubious aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I apologise if I go over some ground that might have been covered during the previous sitting of the Committee. As the record will show, I did not attend the previous sitting, and I understand that I missed interesting contributions from Conservative Back Benchers about a picture of me in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> and about some of my activities. Conservative Members were most upset. They were described as "fair billing"—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) wishes to make a contribution I am happy to give way, but he does not have the courage of his convictions. He is more content to make contributions from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would never do that, would he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that hon. Gentleman wish to make a contribution as well, or does he wish to behave like a hypertrophic schoolboy bouncing around in the back seats keeping away from the teacher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did someone make a racist remark?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can hardly cope with all the remarks flying around. This is like a Conservative party meeting with everyone talking at once and no one making any decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not in Committee for the previous sitting because I was at a meeting in Inverness where I met an educationist. I cannot remember if he was the Minister's former headmaster or only involved in the region where the Minister was educated. He gave me some interesting insights into the Minister's educational background. They are particularly important in relation to clause 25. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, East—I mean, Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sixes and sevens as usual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interesting comments are being made from sedentary positions this morning. It is not like the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) not to have the courage of his convictions and stand up if he wishes to speak. He has obviously been influenced by his hon. Friends on the Back Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that the Whip is trying to get hon. Gentlemen to settle down. Clause 25 is typical of the way the Government are treating Scotland because the measure is a centralising one. It is full of references to the Secretary of State taking
	<span class='label label-info column'>886</span>
powers and making regulations. Subsection (2) uses the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State under this section (referred to in this Part of this Act as 'grant regulations')".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) discussed subsections (3) and (4). Subsection (4) states that matters
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be such as may be determined by or in accordance with the regulations."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (6) mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"reference to an estimate of the amount which will be so payable made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (7) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A board of management to whom any payments in respect of recurrent, capital or special purpose grants are made shall comply with such requirements as the Secretary of State may from time to time impose, being requirements—
	<ol>
	<li>specified in grant regulations…</li>
	<li>determined in accordance with such regulations by the Secretary of State.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Subsection (8) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Requirements imposed under subsection (7) above… may be imposed… at any time,… may at any time be waived… subject to subsection (9)."</p></blockquote>
The clause centralises power within the Scottish Office. It removes power from parents, pupils, teachers and education authorities and concentrates it centrally. It takes power away from the democratically elected representatives of the parents and pupils. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, that is typical of this Government. After the catastrophe that befell the Government in Scotland in the general election, they were faced with two options. They could go back to consensus politics, as the Secretary of State of Wales did, or follow the example of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in his undiluted, non-consensus, Right-wing, ideological politics. The Secretary of State is trying to recoup that. He has realised, two years into undiluted extremism, typified by clause 25, that the game is a bogey. He helped me to save the vet school, he intervened in the Scottish and Newcastle dispute, he has been working with the SSEB and British Coal, and he is helping my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) and me to save Prestwick airport. So he has obviously decided that a clause such as clause 25 is not his only course of action and that he can also do splendid work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Secretary of State for Scotland is trying to distance himself from the Minister. He is not present this morning, even to debate this important clause, because he does not want to be associated with its passage through the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I usually agree with my hon. Friend, but the Secretary of State may have a good reason for his absence. He might be trying to recoup some of the losses of the Scottish people. He is an extremely busy man. He not only helps to run the Scottish Office but tries to cover up for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25 deals with grants available to opted-out schools. Those grants may be used to induce schools
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>887</span>
to opt out. Conservative Members have often asked us how many schools will opt out. We do not know, but my view is that only a handful will do so. I have talked to headmasters and teachers, and I am beginning to think that it will be only a small handful. Even schools that might have been considering it, clearly are not. But one of the imponderables is the provision of inducements. The Minister says that this is an enabling Bill, but we do not believe that it will be left at that. The Minister's style is to induce schools to opt out. The Highland health board refused to continue with competitive tendering because it was too busy doing other things. The Minister called the chairman and the general manager to the Scottish Office and told them that they must carry out that practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about local democracy and letting people decide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing democratic about health boards—they are appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that there is nothing democratic since the Government came to power. The only reason I referred to the Highland health board was to show that, if there is no demand and if the Minister cannot generate it, he forces it. We are worried that the grants will be used as inducements. I can imagine the Minister phoning his friends. When I was in Scotland last week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman visits Scotland occasionally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not like the hon. Gentleman to intervene from a sedentary position. He usually has the courage of his convictions and stands up to make his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, I saw an interesting party political broadcast in which the Minister appeared. I asume that Conservative Members missed it. It was about school boards and opting out. When the Minister referred to bureaucrats and civil servants, his upper lip rose, he showed his canines, started frothing at the mouth, and went red in the face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misrepresent me. I was speaking about bureaucrats and politicians, and the hon. Gentleman's speech confirms much of the sentiment conveyed by that expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just admitted that he frothed at the mouth, showed his canines and jumped up and down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did his hands become hairy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His hands were underneath the camera, so we could not see what they were doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister lined up people who were either members of the Tory party or supporters there to generate demand. That is why we are worried about
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>
the clause, and the recurrent and special purpose grants. Will the Minister give some examples of how they will be used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether there will be time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to leave the Minister plenty of time to deal with the matter. What are special purpose grants for? If a school is to be closed by an education authority or moved because the building is in a bad state of repair and would cost too much to maintain, will large grants be used to renovate that building if the school should opt out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grants are just one way in which a demand for opting out could be generated. Another way in which the Minister could generate demand is through his use and abuse of statistics and research. We all know that the nature of research and science is to take empirical data and convert it into general postulates and statements. The trouble is that the Minister takes general statements and postulates and converts them into empirical data. I understand why the Scottish Education Department has tried to distance itself from some of the research that the Minister has been using. The Assessment of Achievement Programme survey says that, although it was commissioned and funded by the SED, responsibility for its contact lies outwith the Department. I understand that civil servants do not want that use and abuse of statistics and research to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Used together, false data, recurrent grants and preying on the problems and difficulties of education authorities are a powerful, potent weapon for the Minister to try and force schools to opt out. There is no great demand for opting out. The more I go round Scotland—I have travelled up to Highlands and Islands, talking to teachers and headmasters, and I have been through the central belt—the less I think that any schools will want to opt out. But the clause is a powerful tool to induce schools to do so, and that is why we are opposed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate, but few questions have been raised. Speeches have focused on other matters, and I shall not dwell on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The researchers involved—Dr. Sally Brown and others—in the Assessment of Achievement Programme survey are incensed by the attack on the integrity of their work. It is for them to defend it, and I am sure that they will do so. It is unwise for Opposition Members to get involved in a debate between researchers. No doubt they will follow the pattern that they have followed in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister got involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My involvement has been simply to draw attention to the results of researches which, as they appear in the press today, show that there has been a fall in standards in primary schools. It is significant of the "if it is good enough for Henry McLeish's children, it is good enough for everyone else" approach that the Opposition, when faced with evidence that standards have declined, seek to rubbish the source of the evidence rather than attack the problem as the Government wish to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Assessment of Achievement Programme, does the Minister stick by his smear on Scottish teachers and school children that standards in mathematics have disturbingly and dramatically declined? Is he aware that the publication of that report was mischievous and that an established and authoritative research organisation has suggested that it was so fundamentally flawed as to be meaningless? How can the Minister tell the Committee that there has been a decline in standards and how can he accuse us of rubbishing the research when it is the Minister's abuse of the research that has caused alarm in the academic community and in education authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is entitled to his opinion. I stick by what I said. The Assessment of Achievement Programme was endorsed by the inspectorate and my Department. My Department is satisfied with the quality of the research, and the researchers involved at the Northern College of Education and Dr. Sally Brown of the Scottish Council for Research in Education are not noted for being at the forefront in pressing Government policies. I am confident in the quality of the work, but it is for the researchers to defend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. McPherson again reared his head in the context of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). Mr. McPherson must take responsibility for his allegations about the quality of the work, and I expect that the researchers working on the Assessment of Achievement Programme will defend their results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central will know that we have announced a substantial expansion in the programme. When the results were published in 1983, Opposition Members and others did not denounce them. They are now uncomfortable because the 1988 results have shown a decline in achievements. The hon. Member for Fife, Central does teachers a disservice if he thinks that they regard such objective research as a smear upon their work. I imagine that many teachers would argue, with some justification, that there has not been enough emphasis on some subjects and that is why standards have declined.

The hon. Member for Fife, Central has got himself in an unfortunate position. I shall not join him in the crossfire between education researchers. Nevertheless, I undertake that if it is shown that the Assessment of Achievement Programme research is

The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden asked what special purpose grants might cover. They might cover any special purposes arising in a self-governing school. I cannot give a definitive list but, for example, the grants might cover the cost to self-governing schools of paying VAT on supplies and services, or of matching any specific grants available to authorities in respect of activities such as assistance with in-service teacher training. The grants could also provide a vehicle for payments to cover unforeseen spending on contingencies such as fire or flooding. Schools will have to have appropriate insurance cover, but a relatively small school which has to maintain a service to its pupils is vulnerable. There are a variety of instances where special purpose grants may be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned to hear the Minister say that a special purpose grant would be made available in the event of a fire at the school. If a self-governing school does not insure itself properly, will the Minister pick up the tab?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is probably not aware of the insurance provisions in the public sector. The school would obviously have to be insured, but if particular arrangements had to be met to get the school up and functioning quickly, and if there was a need for finance, a special purpose grant could be provided. Of course, each case would be considered on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister read out the regulations for England, but he missed the one about providing
	<br><blockquote><p>"assistance with costs arising from staff restructuring agreed during the first year of operation as a grant-maintained school."</p></blockquote>
Will that provision also apply in Scotland? If so, it is sinister. It suggests that if self-governing schools
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>891</span>
have help with redundancy payments, they will probably make redundant members of staff who are unacceptable, for ideological or political reasons, and no longer required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the penalties that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden pays for wandering the Highlands and Islands asking people their opinion on self-governing schools is that he misses Committee proceedings. At our previous sitting, I covered that point fully and confirmed that special purpose grants would be available in principle to help schools in particular instances, where they were involved in restructuring following the acquisition of self-governing status. We had a debate on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East said that there was no democratic input in the funding. That is incorrect. The funding to the self-governing schools will be on the same basis as the school could have expected had it remained within local authority control. Therefore, if one local authority's democratic decision is to spend more on schools than another authority decides to do, a self-governing school in the area of the authority spending more will receive more recurrent grant than one in the local authority area which had decided to spend less. The level of spending in a self-governing school will be determined by the local education authority, not by the Secretary of State, who will operate under regulations embodying that principle. As the democratic decisions about funding will be taken by the local authority, the hon. Member for Dundee, East was wrong to say what he did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) talked about the hidden agenda. Great tracts of the excellent No Turning Back publication, "Save our Schools" were read out to the Committee by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I had the feeling that he was reading it for the first time. He should take the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and go to tomorrow's press conference. It seems that what the group writes becomes very much centre stage two years on. The hon. Gentleman would do well to read publications a little earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles talked about the hidden agenda. It is remarkable that an Opposition who set out by denouncing the Bill as wicked and evil and said that they would fight it in Committee—something that we await with interest—no longer find it possible to argue against the Bill but have to dream up a secret, hidden agenda. From that I deduce that, as they have studied the Bill and listened to our deliberations, they have realised that it is a reasonable and responsible measure. That is why they have invented a hidden agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about the calculation and reclamation of grant. The grant can be reclaimed under clause 26. The precise amount paid to a self-governing school by the education authority will be the amount that is reclaimed. There is no question of any unfairness, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On what basis will the Minister decide the level of the amount to be recovered? How
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
will he assess what a self-governing school would have received had it remained under education authority control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The grant will be made under regulations, on which we shall consult. The regulations have not yet been laid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He sought incorrectly to argue that the Government have not consulted on the proposals. Now he is trying to get me to outline, in advance of consultation, the basis on which regulations will operate. Does he think that I should lay down now, before consultation, the basis on which the regulations will be made? If so, I am happy to consider his advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he has no idea of the basis on which he will consult education authorities? Will he go along with a blank sheet of paper, listen to education authorities, and then agree with them? If so, the Opposition are prepared to withdraw the next amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have no idea of what education authorities will say, it would be irresponsible to accept the hon. Gentleman's Offer, but I have a clear idea of what the regulations will do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations will ensure that self-governing schools are funded on the same basis as the education authority would have provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister; there is a Division in the other Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman finds that the matter relates only to England he will no doubt return without taking part in the proceedings, as he is such a principled individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To cover the gap while my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is absent, will the Minister comment on one matter? Clearly, he has given little thought to the regulations, and consultation will not be forthcoming in the way that Opposition Members would like. How will VAT and rates be dealt with in grant maintained schools? The regulations issued to English education authorities for consultation and guidance are perplexing. Will grant-aided schools have charitable status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman means self-governing schools. He must not read the brief from COSLA, which deals with English regulations. "Grant-maintained" is an English term. The hon. Gentleman seeks to translate English provisions into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me to determine whether a school is eligible for charitable status. I imagine that self-governing schools will be eligible for charitable status,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>893</span>
so will have rates relief. The additional VAT liability on self-governing schools will be met through the special purpose grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Dundee, East is asking me what the regulations will be or how we will get the necessary information. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> We had an interlude while the hon. Gentleman was out of the Committee doing his bit for the United Kingdom. I was about to deal with his question about how the Secretary of State will work out the level of recurrent grant. Education authorities have systems for allocation of resources to school level, such as staffing standards. Under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, education authorities are required each year to provide to school boards information about actual and proposed expenditure on the running costs of the school and capital expenditure for every school under their management. The details of those costs should be set out in regulations to be made after full consultation. In addition, clause 25(2) empowers the Secretary of State to collect further information as necessary. Ample information on financial matters will, therefore, be available to assess the appropriate grant for any school that applies for self-governing status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the rule of equivalent treatment will not apply to capital or special purpose grants? Or is he saying that a self-governing school will not be able to embark upon a unique capital project—one that is found anywhere else but in the local education authority area? If it could embark on such a project, how would he achieve equivalent treatment between that school and the local education authority schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a reasonable point if he is arguing that equivalence is a more difficult principle to apply in respect of capital expenditure. Currently, local authorities agree a capital provision with the Scottish education department, but they are free to determine their priorities once that allocation has been made. The Scottish Office will give priority to particular projects, but the decision as to priority remains with the local authority. Self-governing schools wishing to gain capital support will need to make a case for the Secretary of State to consider in relation to other priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example is the replacement for Stonelaw high school, which was not a priority for Strathclyde. We assume that due to a legal technicality and the sudden discovery of a road that was not known about previously, it has now become a priority and the money will be found to build a new Stonelaw high school. The education authority is free to take such decisions. It has no doubt reacted in the best traditions of the past five years by responding to the wishes of parents in Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he will receive separate bids for capital allocation from self-governing schools, which will be considered together with those from, for example, Fife region or Strathclyde, or does he intend to create a separate
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
capital programme for self-governing schools? What will be the mechanism for the overall financing of capital expenditure in a self-governing school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position will remain the same. Local authority capital provision will be decided after discussions. A total amount of consent will be available and priorities will be determined. That will apply to local authority and self-governing schools. If the roof of a school were to fall in, that would take priority over a less pressing need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help me with another example? If a school was closed, or the pupils transferred elsewhere, because the building was in a bad state of repair, can we assume that the Secretary of State will not allow it to opt out and then give it a massive capital grant for buildings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman may not assume that. The Secretary of State will consider the application on its merits. It would be absurd for him to do otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State had not intended previously to provide the capital for building, can we assume that the school will not be allowed to opt out and then be given a capital grant? Does the Minister understand my point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make but he does not understand the system. The education authority determines its priorities within its capital allocation. In giving priority to particular projects, the Secretary of State will apply set criteria but the education authority may have different priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, parents in Livingston came to see me because they wanted a new Catholic School. The Secretary of State has consented to the capital provision but as some members of the council do not think it appropriate to have another denominational school in the area, Lothian region has not given it priority. In such a case, it could be possible for provision to be made if the school acquired self-governing status. I should perhaps emphasise that that is not a statement of intent in that particular case, but it is a good example of what could happen. I am sure that that was what the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that Lothian education authority had used its capital allocation to build a denominational school, which then opted out a year later. Would the capital debt remain with Lothian education authority or would it transfer to the self-governing school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can read as well as me. The debt would remain with the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that fair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks from a sedentary position whether that is fair. It depends on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>
his concept of fairness. Given that money is made available to provide education for children within the state sector, if that education is being provided, I see no difficulty. If the debt were transferred to the self-governing school, it would have to be deducted from the education authority's grant provision. It would simply be a book transfer. The system should reflect the needs and aspirations of parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear about equivalents of capital expenditure. Is the Minister saying that there could be higher capital expenditure per pupil in self-governing schools than in schools that remain under education authority control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking an absurd question. What does he mean by higher capital expenditure per pupil? Capital expenditure per pupil is higher in a new education authority school than in other education authority schools. It will be higher in an old school that has just had a new roof than in a school that has had no maintenance. The hon. Gentleman asks me to make a meaningless comparison and he will not be surprised if I do not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister concedes that self-governing schools can get disproportionately greater funding than education authority schools, that renders meaningless the principle of self-governing schools getting equivalent funding to education authority schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must listen. I said that the school will be funded on the same basis as it could reasonably expect to have been funded had it remained in the education authority system. The idea of capital allocations being carried out on a per capita basis even goes beyond the aspirations of the No Turning Back group. It would be absurd to allocate capital on a per capita basis and I am horrified that the hon. Gentleman proposes it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles makes an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain what it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will bide his time, I shall. The Government cannot guarantee that there will be equal capital expenditure treatment between an opted-out school and an education authority school. Ultimately, it will be up to the Secretary of State, just as it is now with capital provision for education authority schools. If a school opts out and puts in a bid to the Scottish Office for a capital expenditure programme of £3 million or £4 million, the Secretary of State could accept that at the same time as Fife or Tayside regions receive £2 million or £3 million for the remaining schools. The Bill allows the Secretary of State to provide for that and that is our worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman is worried that if an education authority refuses, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
capricious or wrong reasons, to make a priority of a particular capital investment, parents would have the opportunity to gain support. Let me give an example in addition to the complicated Livington example that I have given already. I am afraid that this example comes yet again from our biggest education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a surprise. Show us your canines!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a most progressive authority that has embraced with enthusiasm the new principles. Let us take the case of Neilston primary school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood. My hon. Friend is about to rejoin the Committee, just as I discuss this matter, and doubtless will be able to confirm my recollection, which is a little hazy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neilston primary school wished to build an extension. From memory, I recall that its cost was only about £265,000. That extension was to accommodate the extra pupils coming to the school because parents in my hon. Friend's constituency were pleased by the standard of education there. Rather than spend the £265,000 and make that a priority on its capital programme—which, according to our criteria for allocations, could have been met—Strathclyde decided not to build the extension, but to send the children by bus to a school in Barrhead that had less capacity. The parents thought that to be unfair and they protested. Strathclyde ignored those protests and refused to make building the extension a priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood asked me to give the money to Strathclyde. I could not do that because Strathclyde had to make it a priority, which it refused to. The parents passed motions in a meeting showing that they would be interested in self-governing status. I let slip that point, by chance, on "Left, Right and Centre". My hon. Friend tells me that the Labour regional councillor found Strathclyde's view changed by the revelation that self-governing status was an option. Lo and behold, Strathclyde made the Neilston extension a priority, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State agreed the funding and the school is to get its extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already had examples such as Stonelaw and the special school that was featured in yesterday's newspapers. Neilston is another example of how the Bill concentrates the minds of local authorities. Even as we debate it, it is having an effect on education throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's recollection is right: self-governing status was raised publicly at the meeting. Will he confirm that the Neilston fight was an all-party fight, and that the local Labour regional councillor wholly supported the parents, as I did? The only person who criticised Neilston was the local Labour Member of Parliament, the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who denounced the idea of an extension and of agreeing with what the parents, the local Tory Member of Parliament and the local Labour party agreed, and that is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The fight for Stonelaw was also an all-party campaign in Rutherglen. It is amazing how, when parents express their views, an all-party campaign follows closely behind. That is exactly the force that we seek to exploit in the Bill.

The little fable about Nielston primary school illustrates how important it is that the Secretary of State has the ability to make a capital allocation to a self-governing school, which might not meet the education authority's priority.
