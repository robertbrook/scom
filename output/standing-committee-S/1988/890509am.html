TECHNOLOGY ACADEMIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 205, in page 42, line 16, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) It shall be prescribed that only registered teachers shall be employed, or continue to be employed, as teachers in technology academies.".</p></blockquote>
I hope that we shall have a long clause stand part debate but, in moving the amendment, I am aware of the importance of this debate on technology, technical issues and science in Scottish education. We can tackle the more substantive issues later this morning.<br><br>
One issue that has been generated in the Scottish debate and in the context of establishing city technology colleges in England, is the type of teachers who could be employed in technology academies. The amendment seeks to provide the context within which a teacher will be employed, similar to that for those now working in the education authority sector. The amendment refers specifically to registration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene so early in the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I imagine that amendment No. 205 is serious and has not been tabled merely so that the Labour party can speak and vote against it.<br><br>
Strathclyde proposes to use people who are not necessarily trained teachers. Is that in keeping with Labour party philosophy and how does it line up with the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to that in the clause stand part debate, because I have details of correspondence between the Scottish Office and Strathclyde. It is not true to say that Strathclyde is unconcerned about registered teachers, but I shall tackle that point later as I have relevant information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman said what correspondence has been made available to him. If he has copies of correspondence between the Scottish Office and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1288</span>
Strathclyde, in fairness, I should make it available to all members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred to a compilation of material that I received from Strathclyde. It does not consist of letters, but gives the substantive content of discussions on technology academies and the subsequent debates within Strathclyde on whether those discussions could form the basis of an agreement within the council. However, the Labour group in the council did not accept the concept. There have been further developments since, which will form part of the wider debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that Councillor Malcolm Green was reported accurately in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 6 May? He is reported as saying that the region's technology centre would provide staff who are "not necessarily trained teachers". If that report is accurate, will the hon. Gentleman explain how it differs from his views?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to speak for about an hour on the issues in Strathclyde, if that is your wish, Mr. Martin. I initially wished to deal with the amendment and intended to cover the wider issues later. I am prepared to respond comprehensively to the issues that have been raised, but I shall leave the Chair to decide whether I should be allowed to do that now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman been given a copy of the joint briefing paper on technology academies, which was prepared by Strathclyde regional council and the Scottish Education Department? I can arrange for copies of that paper to be circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have copies of papers on the negotiating guidelines for technology academies and a copy of the briefing paper on technology academies, both of which were prepared by Strathclyde regional council's department of education. They provide a comprehensive summary of the issues raised in the discussions and are important to the debate on technological education.<br><br>
The issue of licensed teachers is germane, but the contribution that Strathclyde regional council has made to the debate is not as clear cut as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would want us to believe. That is why the Strathclyde dimension should form part of the stand part debate. I anticipated that those comments would be made by Conservative Members, and they are important. I shall consider them later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that Councillor Malcolm Green is chairman of Strathclyde regional council's education committee? If he has been reported accurately, it suggests that that committee is prepared to accept the employment of teachers who are not registered with the General Teaching Council, in the technology academy that will be run jointly by the council and the private sector. That flies in the face of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, which provides that teachers must be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0729">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1289</span>
registered. Was the chairman of the largest education authority in Scotland reported accurately? If he was, is the Labour party in favour of the principle of employing non-registered teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party is opposed to technology academies in the form proposed by the Government. In addition, we are opposed to the concept of licensed instead of registered teachers being employed. If the hon. Gentleman had seen the documents that I have, he would be aware that Councillor Malcolm Green has stiffened his resolve against the independent nature of technology academies and against creaming off pupils. Strathclyde regional council does not accept the concept of licensed teachers. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North were aware of the wider discussion in Strathclyde, he would know that the council is concerned with technology, technical education, science and computer literacy. It would be a tragedy if a single narrow aspect of the Government's proposals obscured Strathclyde's real dilemma in widening its provision of that education. We should not discuss the issue of licensed teachers in isolation from the wider concept of resource centres, which would link training with further education, university education and the business community. The Strathclyde concept, which is under discussion, goes much wider than the narrow definition of technology education on which the technology academy is premised.<br><br>
It is predictable and characteristic of the Government to jump in with both feet immediately after Opposition Members mention an issue that has had some press coverage two or three days previously. It is crucial that the debate on the serious subject of technological education in Scotland should revolve around the Government's concept. Strathclyde's response is important, but the issue goes much wider than merely the narrow preoccupations of Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman deny that Strathclyde has issued press releases and has been quoted in the Scottish press as saying that it will set up its own technology academies, which will be similar to those of the Government, in conjunction with the private sector?<br><br>
Does he deny that Councillor Malcolm Green has been quoted on that? My question is in no way demeaning or diminishing, but is trying to discover whether, once again, Strathclyde is showing the Labour Front-Bench where to go. Labour Front-Bench Members, not Conservative Members, are discomfited. We know what we want to do; we are trying to find out what Opposition Members want to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With your tolerance, Mr. Martin, I shall widen the debate now because Conservative Members clearly cannot contain themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Widening the debate is not permissible.<br><br>
So far, hon. Members have talked to the amendment, and as long as they keep to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1290</span>
amendment, that is fine. There is no question of widening the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Martin. Perhaps it will satisfy the hon. Member for Tayside, North if I provide him with the comments of a Strathclyde regional council information paper on its discussions with the Scottish Office. That paper is entitled, "Strathclyde regional council: Matters For Discussion on Technology Academies". The hon. Gentleman's point is answered on page 4. It is important that he listens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regional council would expect the governing body to adhere to national conditions of employment and salary scales and to existing arrangements for the registration of teachers."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a minute. The paper puts it succinctly. In earlier discussions with the Government, and subsequently, Strathclyde regional council made two points about national conditions of employment and salary and the registration of teachers. I can provide the hon. Member for Tayside, North with a copy of those facts, dated 13 December 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm or deny that Malcolm Green was reported accurately? I refer not to December, but to 6 May. Was he reported accurately as saying that
<br><blockquote><p>"It would provide equipment not normally available to schools as well as staff with industrial experience (not necessarily trained teachers)"?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has asked that question several times. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was not present at that interview, so he would have difficulty knowing whether the report was accurate. I am worried that that question keeps being posed, but that no member of the Committee was present when the interview took place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I note your point. I do not wish to stress the Committee; I simply wanted the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to tell me what you, Mr. Martin, have just said. As he did not do so, I had to probe to find out whether the hon. Gentleman knew what the Labour party's policy was. He has had lengthy discussions with Strathclyde regional council and intended to widen the debate, whereas I have been trying to stick to the narrow debate on the registration of teachers.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping, Mr. Martin, that you had interpreted the question, too. I was asked to say whether Dr. Malcolm Green was reported accurately. That is an impossibility. The hon. Gentleman then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0730">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1291</span>
asked about the Labour party's position, but I told him that without equivocation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wait until I finish this point.<br><br>
The two questions have been reasonably answered. I also referred to the contents of a Strathclyde regional council paper "Matters for Discussion on Technology Academies". The paper was in response to a letter from the Scottish Education Department inviting the council's views on technology academies in Scotland, as proposed by the Under-Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has obviously been given a copy of the document that the Scottish Office put to Strathclyde. The document was agreed between Councillor Gray, the Secretary of State and myself. On page 6, under the heading, "The Teaching Staff", it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Academy would be an independent school. As such, statutory requirements in relation to registration with the General Teaching Council and national negotiations regarding salaries and conditions of service would not apply."</p></blockquote>
So why is the hon. Gentleman seeking to amend the Bill by introducing conditions that Councillor Gray and his colleagues did not consider necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to exchange my document for the Minister's, because I do not seem to have the six pages of the document that he mentioned. The paragrapgh that I quoted was about matters for discussion. Since the discussions took place between the Scottish Office and Strathclyde, they have been the subject of debate within the Strathclyde Labour group. At that point, any tentative agreement that may have been struck by the council leaders and the education directorate was rejected by the Labour group. Whether that was a right decision for the Labour group to take, in view of the discussions that had been held between the Strathclyde leader and the director of education, is a matter for contention. All I have to report is that the Strathclyde Labour group took that decision. Perhaps we should discuss how that debate has moved on within Strathclyde, the Scottish Office and Scotland generally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman with the missing pages. For the convenience of members of the Committee, copies of the document are now on the table.<br><br>
When the hon. Gentleman says that the debate has moved on, does he mean that the comments attributed to Councillor Green in <i>The Scotsman</i> represent a further development of policy, in so far as Strathclyde accepts the view that teachers do not have to be registered to participate in technology centres?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asks a reasonable question, but avoids the more complex arguments. Initially, Strathclyde regional council was faced with the prospect of technology academies based on the English city technology colleges, but with some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1292</span>
flexibility in terms of the Scottish dimension. Clearly, discussions ensued on the narrow definition of technological education in Scotland. The Minister now appears to be asking whether the form of teaching, the type of teacher, the registration and the licence issued have changed in status in Strathclyde. The concept that Strathclyde is considering is different from that promoted by the Government.<br><br>
We are talking about an interest in technological education. I see from <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> that technology resource centres are being considered. There is a significant difference between that and the concept of a technology academy, which is essentially a school which would cream off up to 1,000 pupils, which would have the ethos of a school, which would take children from 11 for six years' education and would have a heavy emphasis on science and technology. That concept has been discussed publicly. Conservative Members will have to get to grips with the fact that Strathclyde is now considering the concept of technology and resourcing, but that it need not necessarily take the form of the technology academy.<br><br>
The Minister asked about licensed teachers and trainers. If the concept moved from a technology academy—a school—to a resource facility serving a wider catchment of interests and skills, the issue of who teaches, trains and who is in that centre would change. If we add to a technology academy, which may have a private benefactor—which is fine—the concept of a university, further education and the business community, we have a substantial concept. I said that the Labour party is opposed to the narrow concept of technology academies and to non-registered teachers being in the equivalent of an independent school. However, we are interested in widening the debate on what technological education should be in Scotland towards the year 2000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the semantics of what the hon. Gentleman is talking about. He seems to be rejecting technology academies, while, for once, he seems to be supporting Sir Charles Gray, who apparently was calling for a centre of excellence with private sector funding and its own equipment. As Councillor Green and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said, it would be able to take on unregistered teachers. The hon. Gentleman must explain how it is that he rejects the concept of technology academies, while he warmly welcomes that concept, as long as it is called a centre of excellence or anything other than a name given to it by my hon. Friend the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members do not appreciate that this is a moving picture show. They forget that in the real world of Scottish education, life goes on between the Tuesday and Thursday morning press hand-outs and briefs from the Minister.<br><br>
Let us discuss the hon. Gentleman's interesting notion about the difference between a technology academy and a technology resource centre. Anyone who has had a review of the literature in Europe and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1293</span>
considered some of the work of Cedafop and the EEC Commission will know that this is not an issue peculiar to England or Scotland. There is an emphasis on improving competitiveness, computer literacy and technological competence and a drive for more scientists and more technicians in Europe. That obviously gets different responses in different countries. However, few countries would want an elitist system in which some children were creamed off to be given a more intensive technological education.<br><br>
The success of the Europeans and the Japanese is that they recognise that some children who have such skills and interests will go on to further education and university education and take up positions in industry where they are much needed. Another argument is that the long-term performance of the economy will ultimately depend on the technological upskilling and upgrading of all children. A reason why the technology academy should not be supported is that it turns its back on the general concept of giving all children technological upgrading, computer literacy and competence in all such matters. Both we and the Government agree on that, although it will take years to produce results.<br><br>
Some people would argue cynically—obviously I would not do that in this forum—that the major thinking behind the technology academy is just another aspect of the two drives to undermine education authority provision and to promote independent schools. Opted-out schools, technology academies, CTCs and grant-maintained schools in England are all part of that drive. I do not want to dwell on that, because this issue is crucial—which is why I am still hopeful that we shall have a debate on the wider implications of technology education. The Government may promote it by saying that it is best satisfied by a technology academy. I reject that. A much more diverse response should be formulated according to the needs of Scottish education and the economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at page 4 of the document dated 18 January which has been made available to the Committee, he will find that it refers to technology centres. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is intended that … the Allan Glen's site should be used separately by the Region for the development of a Regional Technology Centre in collaboration with the University of Strathclyde."</p></blockquote>
The technology centre was part of the package that was offered through the SED for a technology academy. If he thinks that the technology centre is such a good idea and that it is important for children from outside the academy to have access to the facilities, does he agree that it was wrong of the Labour group on Strathclyde to pull the rug from under Charles Gray, the director of education, the chief executive of Strathclyde and Councillor Malcolm Green? In view of what he hon. Gentleman has just said, would it not have been wiser for Strathclyde to have gone ahead in partnership with the Scottish Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are beginning to stray wide of the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1294</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are straying from amendment No. 205, which is crucial to the debate. Nevertheless, the Minister has raised a fair point about licensed teachers, who would have been discussed by the Labour group. It is more than a trifle academic that a decision was taken by a Labour group, which was democratically elected to do such a thing—a fact that is sometimes lost on the Government. Politically, the Strathclyde Labour group made the right decision—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which Labour group?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Strathclyde Labour group, when it was discussing the outcome of the negotiations. I do not want to confuse the two issues. I have a personal, political view on technology academies; Strathclyde Labour group may have taken the decision on entirely different grounds. The Minister and his officials would be better served by getting in touch with Strathclyde and finding out what is the current state of the discussions. A Government should always have a monopoly of wisdom, but I perceive some little gaps in their knowledge base in their desire to raise the issue of Strathclyde, as usual, and the question of resource centres. The debate continues within Strathclyde and there will be further developments. The Minister said that the document referred to a technology centre. Strathclyde's thinking has moved on significantly, and it may be considering a wider resource centre and not a technology academy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) intervenes, I must say that Strathclyde's dilemma is simple. It sees the Government as a hovering predator. The newly appointed director is looking for sites in Scotland and writing to local authorities, such as Fife, to seek meetings. That is fine. Strathclyde could say that it wants nothing to do with the matter. It could tell Charles Forte to keep his £1.5 million and the Government to keep their cash because it wants to retain the integrity of the comprehensive system, but with such a Government that would be foolish because it might get a technology academy whether it likes it or not.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I prevented the hon. Member for Eastwood from intervening. It is interesting that the Minister says that Strathclyde will get a technolgy academy whether it likes it or not. There is nothing like the Minister's sharp honesty, which I confess I grudgingly admire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Perhaps he can fill in some of the gaps in my information base on this matter. Can I take him back to the amendment? Presumably he is against a technology that includes or is related to a regional technology centre as proposed in the

document. A regional technology centre would employ university lecturers who would not be registered teachers, so the Labour party must be against regional technology centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's logic is tortuous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I rephrase it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point perfectly. He raises a wider point which justifies the argument. There is a distinction between a technology academy, or school, and a much wider resource concept of technological education which might employ people ranging from those with industrial and craft-based skills but no teaching experience to academics who would not comply with the criteria of the teaching profession either. The narrow concept of a technology academy which the Government are promoting has been a dismal failure. Local authorities have not queued up to meet the new director, although out of courtesy they will give him coffee and biscuits, and be polite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a report from the <i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</i> of 5 May which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided the regional council can win guarantees that the academy will not introduce selection of pupils at the age of 11, it now appears prepared to discuss details with Mr. Fleming-Brown."</p></blockquote>
Is the hon. Gentleman telling us that Strathclyde will talk to Mr. Fleming-Brown, Scotland's first technology academy director, or not? That report suggests that it will, so there is more confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a timely intevention. I started to explain the Strathclyde dilemma by telling of a predator on the outskirts of Glasgow city and the Minister confessed publicly, instead of privately as previously, that Strathclyde would get a technology academy whether it wants it or not. Such cynicism is nothing new from the Government.<br><br>
When faced with that prospect, an intelligent authority, such as Strathclyde, would have to take one of two options. It could discuss the matter with the Government and with Mr. David Fleming-Brown, who last month took up his appointment as Scotland's first technology academy director. Although it is opposed to academic selection and the Government's proposed technology academy, they could consider whether they could draw up a satisfactory package. That action is understandable. The alternative would be to say that it does not like the technology academy concept because it is about creaming, selection and having licensed teachers, but that it wants to try to turn it round towards the concept of a technology facility. It would not set up an alternative school, but would reinforce the technological education in Glasgow generally which would benefit as many children as possible. The Opposition should not apologise about the dilemma facing Strathclyde because of the Government's desire to have a technology academy in Glasgow and the wider attack on Glasgow schools and Strathclyde that has been made constantly in Committee. If the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1296</span>
debate that the Government have opened up on the technology academy can develop, it will be purposeful and useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. In brief, it is that the Government will proceed anyway, so let us do it our way. Does he not realise that that argument will seem rather weak to the Scottish people? It is like saying that the Government will allow schools to opt out, so let us allow schools to manage themselves in a way that we want or that the Government are going to set up technology academies, so let us set up our own. In other words, let us do anything so long as we do it and the Government are not seen to be doing it. The Government are keeping nuclear weapons, so let us keep nuclear weapons ourselves. The Government will keep capitalism, so let us keep capitalism ourselves. Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that the Labour party is running out of steam, that Socialism is finished and that the Minister is winning the argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These matters have nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you saved the Government from my response, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh dear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The idea that Labour is finished in Scotland is interesting. The Government have never started in Scotland so they will fall even further from a low base line.<br><br>
Strathclyde regional council is a pragmatic authority. This nonsense that faced with a Government who would impose a school— <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister just agreed. The press will have heard the Minister confirm that a technology academy will go to Glasgow, regardless of what Charles Gray or Malcolm Green think. The Minister may want to deny that, but there is some speculation that the Government want to put a compulsory purchase order on Allan Glen's school. Does the Minister want to knock that on the head now? There is a deafening silence. That is one of the problems. It is game, set and match. We have exposed the Government this morning.<br><br>
In this debate about technology academies the hon. Member for Tayside, North instinctively gets up and raises the issue. What do we find?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? He asked me to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall. A technology academy will be located in Glasgow and it does not matter what anybody says. Will the Government take over Allan Glen's school by compulsory purchase?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that we have had a helpful suggestion from Charles Gray about the Government putting a compulsory purchase order on Allan Glen's school which I understand Strathclyde would prefer

to use as offices. Could the hon. Gentleman tell me which statute gives us the power to do so? I am not aware that we have such a power and I am therefore surprised that he is asking me whether we would use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being over-modest about what his Government can do from week to week. I remember what happened over Paisley grammar. A host of things could not be done the day before, but could be done the day after. With the greatest respect to the Minister and his hon. Friends I do not think that that tiny, minor obstacle will deter the Government from pursuing their objectives for political advantage or otherwise. The Government seem hell bent on imposing that facility on Glasgow, regardless of the outcome of other decisions. I am pleased that it is on the record that that course of action will be pursued.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As in the case of Paisley grammar, clearly a Government can introduce regulations or primary legislation. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he believes that under current legislation the Minister has the powers to take the decision about which he was asked, or is he saying that no such powers exist and that the Government would need new legislative powers? It is extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman should accuse the Minister of intending to put a compulsory purchase order on Allan Glen's if he has no power to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Those matters should be raised in the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that the intervention of the hon. Member for Eastwood was about a specific school in which teachers may be affected by amendment No. 205, so the question is relevant. My simple response is this. I have enough respect for the Minister to believe one of two possibilities. The first is that the Government will scan the legislation to see whether there is a facility for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms that. On the other hand, my respect for the Minister extends to realising that his ingenuity may suggest that the Government find ways to embrace that school, so that their intentions can be put into practice in Glasgow.<br><br>
We are particularly worried about that, but Conservative Members have raised interesting points on technology education, which have a major bearing on the amendment. It seems that we always have to go to England and Wales for interesting reading material. The Department of Education and Science produced a paper entitled, "A New Choice of School". It is about city technology colleges. It has also produced the White Paper, Cmnd. 9469, "Better Schools". Those documents have generated debate in England and Wales. I cannot find a similar document in Scotland that allows Scots to go into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1298</span>
detail about the possible impact on the wider comprehensive system.<br><br>
The Baker proposal identifies areas on which we could agree, for example, that technology education is crucial to the development of the English and Welsh economies and of the Scottish economy. But that is where analysis gives way to prescription. Conservative Members seem to have a particularly narrow view on where technology education should go in the 1990s. I shall point out the other choices for Scottish education authorities and the Government.<br><br>
The quality of technological education—for example, computer literacy and industrial and economic awareness—varies enormously. In my own authority in Fife region, there is no need for a technology academy. Not that Fife does not need to improve the quality of technology education, but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the discussion seems to have widened into a clause stand part debate, are hon. Members agreeable to grouping the amendment with the clause stand part debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I should like an opportunity to address my remarks specifically to the amendment. It is important that we consider amendment No. 205 and I should like to debate it in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in order to keep to amendment No. 205 if there is opposition to my suggestion. Even if the amendment is grouped with the clause stand part debate, there is nothing to stop the hon. Member speaking specifically about the amendment. In fact, to do so might break the Committee's habit. I am happy to keep the debate to amendment No. 205, but hon. Members should bear it in mind that they must contain their remarks within the scope of the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The subject that we are discussing under amendment No. 205 has a bearing on the wider issue of technological education. That is why my authority's experience would be relevant and useful to the Committee.<br><br>
Fife has 19 comprehensive schools, with a high level of technical, computer, science and mathematics education. They form a base for a further development of those subjects. One reason for that is that there are qualified teachers, who are unlicensed in the sense of being registered. It is one area where technological education is important.<br><br>
With the development of the technical and vocational education initiative, the youth training scheme, and a whole host of Government programmes, some of which I support, some local authorities employ different people to carry out the various functions. For example, skills training, as compared to a general education in technology or computer literacy, often involves people with no recognised teaching skills working at the interface with young people. That brings us to technology academies.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0734">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1299</span>
No matter how the Government dress up technology academies, they are schools that try to provide a normal curriculum. Despite some of the material provided by the Secretary of State for Education and Science in England, there is a suggestion that a balanced curriculum must be provided outwith school hours. If the objective is to have a balanced curriculum with intensified teaching of technology, science, mathematics and computer studies, qualified, registered teachers are required.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to reflect what most educationists in Scotland would like to see. If another type of school is created to cover the full range of six-year comprehensive education, it is essential to have no licensing of teachers, but to have teachers who are qualified as per the comprehensive system, as well as the opted-out system that may exist when technology academies are introduced.<br><br>
The debate may then revolve around whether, as now happens in schools, students would be involved in work experience. If there is to be a work experience element, or if schools are to expand and develop the TVEI, which is successful in Fife schools, children may be exposed to people who do not need to be qualified teachers as we know them in Scotland. However, that is an add-on and should not be confused with the need for the core curriculum to be dealt with by professionally qualified teachers. This crucial amendment would safeguard technology academies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Having considered my earlier point of order, I am willing to accept the linking of the amendment and clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be for the convenience of the Committee to link amendment No. 205 with clause stand part?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Aye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Presumably, it would now be in order for the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to answer my question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is up to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Mr. Martin, for appearing to be discourteous, but if the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) would repeat his question, I should be willing to respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question has been borne out by our debate this morning. I hope that I am being entirely fair to Councillor Gray. A consensus is building up in the Labour group—I accept that its views are different from those of Councillor Gray—that a technology academy should be established, although it would not be called a technology academy. The Labour group has agreed already to set up schools that would operate like opted-out schools, but they would not be called opted-out schools. The Labour group and the Scottish Labour party in general seem
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1300</span>
to be adopting the policies advocated by my hon. Friend the Minister, but they dare not admit it. That is like saying that there will be a Labour bomb and so long as it is a Labour bomb it is OK, or that it is OK to have a capitalist system so long as it operates under a Labour Government. During our discussions, we have seen develop in the Scottish Labour party the realisation that the Minister is right. It is determined to pursue those policies itself, provided that the Minister is not seen to take the credit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be more views than just those of Councillor Gray and the Labour group. It is instructive that Conservative Members believe that because Strathclyde, the Labour party, or any other organisation make proposals or appear to be pursuing the Government line, that can be raised as a knockabout question. It shows complete ignorance of technology education. It is predictable that Strathclyde should again figure prominently in the discussions as doing the Minister's bidding and taking on board ideological pursuits, so that, hey presto, there is no need for a debate because everyone now agrees with the Government's proposals. That is so wide of the mark that it should be treated with contempt.<br><br>
The important issue is not technology academies. They are nothing more or less than an attempt to widen the Government's political trawl over Scottish education. It would be acceptable to argue for them on the basis of an analysis of the needs of the national economy or individual children, but there is no notion here of the possibility of life after the Government proposal.<br><br>
The simple fact of life is that a debate is taking place throughout Scotland, including Strathclyde. Are we not now to have debates? Are we just to accept the Government's proposals for technology academies, opting out, licensed teachers, teacher appraisals and testing? Local authorities in Scotland operate under a free democracy, with elections every four years that give them the legitimacy to act. The crucial point is that this type of proposal generates a debate and we should not close any avenue just to satisfy the whims and the political knockabout of Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not political knockabout, but a serious matter. Conservative Members have read the joint statement from Strathclyde department of education and the Scottish education department, and we have heard what various people prominent in Strathclyde education have said in recent months, but we do not understand whether there is any difference in view between the aims of Councillor Gray and those of the Minister. As I understand it, there is no difference in view and we are talking about labels. For all that the hon. Gentleman is trying to squirm and avoid the question, he has not been able to answer it. I am not trying to make a debating point. If the hon. Gentleman is saying, yes, there is a modus vivendi on this, let us admit it and move forward. I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman essentially misses the important point that two issues are at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1301</span>
stake this morning. First, there is the discussion about technology education in Scotland. The Government must acknowledge that they are introducing technology academies to address perceived weaknesses and needs in that area. The second issue is whether technology academies address themselves to the Government's or the Opposition's analysis. I shall reinforce that point by quoting from a document on a European perspective on vocational training for young people. It is a policy statement by the Youth Forum of the European committees and was produced in January 1987. Page 22, paragraph 4 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Exposure to the new technologies should be given at the earliest age possible in schools. Such training has been readily tacked on to special employment measures which are on the whole well resourced. These, however, are generally aimed at young people of 16 plus. There is a great need to provide education training in the new technologies for children of primary school age onwards, to guarantee the continuity of such education, to integrate it fully into the rest of the curriculum and to make it—wherever possible— hands on."</p></blockquote>
That summarises the debate for me. It is not about Strathclyde, the narrow concept of a technology academy, or political knockabout; it is about the future of the Scottish economy. We are talking about a future group of children competent in technology skills, literate in computer skills, with an awareness, that they do not have at the present, of the industrial and economic realities of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman agrees. That is a positive analysis or prescription of what we do, but how we achieve that is crucial. I intend to turn the debate not only around technology academies, but alternatives to them.<br><br>
The statement from the Youth Forum referred to the integration of technology skills within the normal curriculum. On 14 October 1986 the Secretary of State for Education and Science made the following statement to the CBI's industry, education and training group. It worries me in terms of a balanced curriculum. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I acknowledge that this emphasis"—</p></blockquote>
that is, technological emphasis—
<br><blockquote><p>"can be achieved only at the expense of some other options, particularly in the fourth and fifth year. The school timetable is not infinitely elastic. Pupils who show aptitude for a second foreign language or for subjects such as music, drama and art may have to pursue these subjects, up to the age of 16, outside the normal working day."</p></blockquote>
It appears that a balanced curriculum is being affected. If we intensify the technology element at the expense of the other important curricular aspects, children will be pushed to learn these subjects outwith school. They may have to pay for them and perhaps study at weekends.<br><br>
That is the essential problem with technology academies. To set politics aside, a balanced curriculum could be destroyed. That must not occur for children up to the age of 16. The spirit of Scottish education lies in the balanced curriculum and the child-centred approach, so that a child is exposed to a wide forum of interests. The Government's concept
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1302</span>
of a technology academy is narrow. The curriculum will centre around core technological subjects, but if that were to be at the expense of the wider curriculum, that would be a major threat to the concept on which Scottish education is based.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle made a valid point about how suited the technology academies would be in providing an intensive course in technology education. That is not the position in Europe. There, specialisation takes place, but an effort is made to improve the general abilities of children from all backgrounds. If the Government were serious about technology education, they would also promote other measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate is moving on in an interesting way. I hope that we can achieve some common ground. I accept what the hon. Gentleman says about the need for a balanced curriculum. I am sure that he has read the pamphlet produced by the Department of Education and Science on city technology colleges. Annex A states that individual programmes made available to students through the structure and application of common course and option choices should be broad and balanced. They should be related to experience and then stretch all pupils to the full potential of their abilities. Students should be enabled to acquire a proper balance of knowledge and understanding of aptitudes and skills, including practical application. It is accepted that they should not be narrow technology courses, but that they should be broad and balanced. Perhaps, we can now reach a common view about the Scottish technology academies.<br><br>
Should the academies follow the guidelines in the joint briefing paper produced by Strathclyde and the Scottish Education Department? It states that technology academies should
<br><blockquote><p>"be established with funding from private sponsors, supported by resources made available from central Government…be owned by charitable companies… provide free education to the full range of secondary pupils… foster the highest standards of motivation".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should refrain from making long interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin, but it is a complex issue and it is important that the hon. Gentleman should respond to my points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will have an opportunity to make his own speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle raises two important points. Unfortunately, the document issued by the Secretary of State for Education and Science accompanied the press release and speech that was given to the CBI. The paper, "A New Choice of School", makes more than a passing reference to the balanced curriculum. It contains modules and structures of curriculum that look impressive, but they are accompanied by paragraph 13. That may have been a lapse by the Secretary of State for Education and Science, or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1303</span>
perhaps he was reported inaccurately. However, he expressed the view that technology rules, so the balanced curriculum cannot be guaranteed. Conservative Members can discover that in the House of Commons Library by looking at the paper with the reference 87/6 item I(79).<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Hornscastle suggested that we should try to decide what we want technology academies to do. However, the Opposition do not want technology academies. That is the essential difference between our views and those of the Government. The hon. Gentleman should at least concede that I am being honest in describing the difference between the Government's proposals and the Opposition's view of what technological education should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot concede that. The hon. Gentleman has not made clear how the concept outlined by Councillor Gray and other spokesmen for Strathclyde is so different from what the Minister proposes. It is incumbent on him to detail how a technology centre, or whatever it is called, set up by Strathclyde regional council would be different from one set up by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To fill in the gaps in the hon. Gentleman's knowledge, perhaps I should have a word with my colleague Charles and invite the English Conservative Members to Strathclyde. I confess that I would not pay for insurance policies on them, and their safety in Glasgow could not be entirely guaranteed. But with those two qualifications it would seem an eminently sensible idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our safety cannot be guaranteed! Is that a threat?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be useful for Conservative Members to be exposed to reality. Strathclyde contains half the Scottish population. We are also concerned about the other major chunk of Scotland, even though Conservative Members may not be. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle referred to the distinctions between the views of Charles Gray and the Minister and between Conservative Members and Opposition Members. The debate in Strathclyde is a matter for Strathclyde regional council. It is moving on from the initial discussions between the Scottish Office and council leaders and is considering a much wider concept. How that materialises will be up to the Government and the Strathclyde council leaders.<br><br>
If we have agreement on the analysis of the United Kingdom economy, we should explore the different descriptions. The technology academy proposal is highly simplistic and has political overtones. I want to consider what technological education should be about in Scotland. The Government should warm to this because it is about flexibility, freedom and diversity to deal with the needs of particular areas, their perception of the economy and the skills available in their communities to improve computer literacy and technological competence.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1304</span>
Strathclyde covers an inner-city area. It is an enormous authority and its response may be different from others. Fife council serves one third of a million people. It has 19 comprehensives and its response may be entirely different. It is an efficient, dynamic authority, which sees an important role for technological education. But it does not believe that the Government's highly centralised concept of technology academies will be helpful, although it has courteously agreed to meet the gentleman who fronts the technology academy organisation for the Government. That is constructive.<br><br>
Let us take other areas in Scotland and the wider canvas of technology in education. In Central and Lothian regions, the responses vary. The Government introduced the TVEI, I believe quite rightly, although my view has been criticised. In Fife and other authorities, it has been well developed and useful. That could be built upon because in the third year—my son is taking such a course in his third year now—all the children are exposed to the TVEI. That is positive. People with money, such as Lord Forte, are around, and the Government, according to Strathclyde council—the Minister may correct me— have £6 million in the capital expenditure programme for technology academies. If significant sums are available, would it not be more sensible for the Government and education authorities to work in partnership with local industry?<br><br>
The Minister of State who deals with Scottish Enterprise is here this morning. We have many criticisms of the concept of Scottish Enterprise but it seeks to have a partnership in an area which reflects industrial skills, an employment base and educational needs. Hopefully, it will bring together people who are committed and concerned, and who are involved in the technological front. One of the Minister of State's key objectives is that because they are vital components in the recovery of the Scottish economy, they should be supported. Why on earth then do we not apply the same concept to technological education in schools?<br><br>
The purist, theoretical thought in education is that a wide general education should be provided up to the age of at least 16 and training should then take place in work, further education or training programmes. Many people were wholly opposed to TVEI or anything like technical education being forced onto the curriculum. I do not share their concerns because, like the Government, I believe that there is a need at least to raise the level of awareness from the post-primary period onwards.<br><br>
That raises another point that this concept does not tackle. If we set up a sixth-form comprehensive, a technology academy, we will be dealing with children with different abilities and interests, who will eventually go to different work or further education locations. In Europe, some children leave at 16. They may go to work; they may not. Some children will go into further education at 16 because that is probably a more adult environment in which they can develop their skills and personality. There are also children of 17 and 18 who will go on to university education. They may have majored in maths, science or computer technology and they will go to university
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1305</span>
and then into industry. That illustrates the wide variety of technology education needs in Scotland.<br><br>
If we put a technology academy in Glasgow, it might be of some benefit to the 1,000 children who would attend, but what would it do for the thrust of technical education throughout the rest of Glasgow, Strathclyde and Scotland? I do not believe for one minute that a highly elitist approach, adopting the objectives and aspirations of 20 or 30 years ago, is of much use to the Scottish economy. Why do the Government not expend their energies and resources on widening the technological base in Scottish education generally? I would support that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I have missed quite a lot of what the hon. Gentleman has been saying. He must realise that the technical colleges in Dundee were schools of excellence. They did a splendid job and they were destroyed with the passage of time. Those schools—certainly the Dundee tech in Bell street—provided a never-ending stream of highly trained engineers of whom we were very proud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) makes a sincere point, but we are trying to avoid such flagships. The helpful Self-Governing Schools Etc. (Scotland) Bill brief prepared by the House of Commons Library refers to a written parliamentary question that was asked by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. McLoughlin). The question was:
<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he has any proposals for the creation of flagship schools as centres of excellence; and if he will make a statement."</p></blockquote>
The reply from the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) was:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have already announced our intention to proceed with the establishment of technology academies in Scotland to provide practical examples of high standards and expectations for pupils, parents and teachers."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 1 February 1989; Vol. 146. <i>c.</i> 306]</p></blockquote>
My response to the hon. Member for Tayside, North is that I wholly reject that type of excellence and that type of flagship. Fife regional council has 19 comprehensives. Is it not right that every parent and every pupil in the general area of each school should exepect that school to be a flagship? Why should that school not be a centre of excellence? According to the highly individualistic creed supported by the Government, should not every child be given the highest quality of education? Excellence means not merely for a few but for the vast majority of children.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting puzzled listening to the hon. Gentleman. I thought that flagships were the Labour party's policy. In one of those exciting policy review documents the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) said that the Labour party's policy was to create flagship schools— comprehensive schools that will set an example to other schools and encourage them to raise their standards. Does the hon. Gentleman repudiate that policy? What he is saying about flagship and magnet schools seems to do that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1306</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the Minister's reference to exciting policy review documents. Exciting is not a word that I have heard used to describe them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that they are dull?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get into further debate about them this morning. It is important to put on the record that for the next election in Scotland, the Labour party will have a set of policies which will be distinctively Scottish. The Minister must appreciate that in England and Wales education is debated and policies are implemented in an entirely different context. In the Scottish context we can look towards the wider goal which is not realisable tomorrow or next year. We can talk about flagships and excellence, but in relation to the school and its locality. It is anathema for me that schools of excellence should be thrown up like a technology academy at Allan Glen's. That would be the Government's flagship. There are people in Scotland who will want some debate on Scottish issues. <i>The Scotsman</i> last week carried a declaration prepared by a think tank of the principles of Scottish education which are unique to Scotland and which should be developed and debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to all hon. Gentlemen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his unfailing courtesy in giving way. Conservative Members understand the Opposition's view that there is something distinctive about Scottish education. That is why we heard at the outset of the Committee that the hon. Gentleman was going to resist the Bill's anglicisation of Scottish education. What we cannot understand is why the amendment paper is littered with amendments which aim to insert chunks of the Education Reform Act 1988 into the Bill. Many of his press releases state that his attempts to improve the Bill are drawn on the English experience. Can he explain that conundrum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The old ones are usually the best. We have discussed anglicisation ad nauseam. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is always entertaining the Committee by running along the Corridor to vote on English business. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's intervention was entirely relevant, so I shall take the next one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we have it on the record from the lips of the hon. Gentleman that what the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) says should apply for England is to be rejected for Scotland? Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the views of the hon. Member for Blackburn on flagship schools are not part of Labour party policy for Scottish education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely correct.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1307</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the only clear statement that the hon. Gentleman has made since 10.30. We are making progress. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the uniqueness of Scottish educational traditions. Does he agree that there is nothing new about the concept of a technology academy in Scotland? That is precisely what Allan Glen's was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same analogy was made when the Government first introduced school boards. They suggested that we would be returning to the position that existed in the early part of the century and that it was all about the community. I do not accept that the future should reflect the past, as the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) suggests. We must return to the question of excellence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is returning to the question of excellence. Twice he referred to "creaming off'. I am happy that pupils should be creamed off, because it has an educational purpose, but I realise that the hon. Gentleman is not in favour of it.<br><br>
The document produced on 18 January 1989 by Strathclyde regional council department of education and the Scottish Education Department on technology acadamies makes it clear that catchment areas will be broad and that the principles will reflect the social balance of the catchment area. Emphasis will be put on provision for socially deprived sectors and an effort will be made to ensure that there will be an even spread of intake that will avoid formal entry tests. Access to the academy will not be limited by family financial circumstances, so a technology academy cannot be described as "creaming off" pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) is an Opposition Member who invariably knows what he is talking about. That is the ultimate insult: I described the hon. Gentleman as a member of the Opposition but, of course, he is a Conservative Member. I may be corrected by English Conservative Members, but I believe that one CTC has been established in Solihull.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fine. Initial analysis of that project suggests that there has not been a significant creaming off. It has also been proven that the general social class background of the school is not entirely unreflective of the surrounding area of Birmingham. Such a concept then, would not automatically lead to difficulties.<br><br>
There is a creaming off process and a problem has been identified in Solihull, although the hon. Member for Hexham was honest enough to admit that he does not consider it to be a problem. But the problem should be considered in the context of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. If a technology academy, which is essentially a six-year comprehensive school, were injected into the midst of the education process, children with natural ability, given parental guidance, interest and enthusiasm, will want to go there. Whether that is defined as selection, creaming off, or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1308</span>
a process to decide admission, its effect on the fabric of education in the surrounding area is worrying.<br><br>
One problem in England, and to a lesser extent in Scotland because the balance of comprehensive education is better there, is that secondary or comprehensive schools with low numbers in the fifth and sixth years may opt out, not because they have been earmarked for closure, but because of the prospect of losing pupils at a certain level. A technology academy in the middle of Glasgow would induce creaming and would have an impact on the viability and efficiency of schools in the surrounding area. If 1,000 pupils are removed from Glasgow schools at a time when that problem is being reviewed, surely that will throw up difficulties for the education authority. So there are practical problems and the hon. Member for Hexham has made a valid point.<br><br>
We could go on and on about this subject. It is a pity that the truncation of discussion of the Bill means that the concept of technological education in Scotland cannot be decided on the basis of proper consultation. The subject should not be dealt with in the Bill: there should be consultation on the future of technological education, but alas, we are not to have it.<br><br>
The Government should have an open mind on technology academies. Strathclyde's dilemmas are not matters for political knockabout: they are education problems that need a partnership, not a pounding from the Government. I shall accept your guidance on the technicalities, Mr. Martin, but I hope that we can vote on amendment No. 205.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My speech will be a little shorter than that of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). In the past hour and a half we have learnt that the policies of the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) do not apply in Scotland. We have also learnt that it is the official position of the Labour party's Front Bench in Scotland that the Labour party's current policy reviews are "not exciting". I had gathered from the press coverage that this was the new, exciting Labour party of the 1990s and beyond.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may want to withdraw his remark about the city of Glasgow—it was made flippantly, and I do not blame him for that—but it will be on the record that the Labour party Front Bench believes that Conservative Members—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I am reminded of his earlier contribution, when the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> described some of his colleagues as brammers. He gave us a long exposition about the derivation of that word. The remark was made flippantly and I am sure that the red carpet will be laid out from Strathclyde house to greet the hon. Gentleman—if he can find the place. I am sure, too, that Councillor Gray will get his knighthood after all the debates that we have had in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought it important that it should be put on the record that the hon. Gentleman's remark was made humorously. As a Conservative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0739">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1309</span>
Member who lives in Glasgow and walks around in perfect safety—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Up till now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Up till now—I should not want the impression to be given that there was any problem.<br><br>
I want to emphasise a point that I made in an intervention: there is nothing new or un-Scottish about the concept of a technology academy. Allan Glen's in Glasgow has been identified as a suitable site. As I was asked to speak at the former pupils' annual dinner, I have studied the history of Allan Glen's school and know that one of its essential characteristics was what is proposed for technology academies. That was its emphasis and justification. Originally it involved private sector philanthropy, as does the concept of technology academies, so there is nothing new about that concept in Scotland.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central spoke with great fluency and knowledge about the European Youth Forum. He had more knowledge about its policies than I have of the intricacies of Strathclyde regional council, but that is a more complicated subject. The hon. Gentleman was right to point out that we must not confuse the need for a high level of general skills and an acquaintance with computers, for example, with the education system as a whole. There is also a case for having schools with a technological focus. Those two concepts are not in the least incompatible.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Some of the objections expressed by Opposition Members do not stand. For example, the hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to the recruitment of pupils. The joint briefing document to which the Minister referred says clearly that the board of governors, in determining the details of the recruitment policy,
<br><blockquote><p>"would observe the broad principles of reflecting the social balance of the catchment area, emphasising provision for socially deprived sectors, ensuring an even spread of intake and avoiding formal entry tests."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a technology academy with 1,000 places is to be established in Glasgow, with the necessary tooling-up of the capital investment, why should not the same cash allocation go to the Glaswegian comprehensives that are supposed to have deprived children? The money could then serve a wider pupil interest and possibly achieve the same objective. Why have a new unit, which would take the children from other schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Money is allocated to schools in deprived areas. The joint briefing paper proposes a combination of a technology academy and a regional technology centre, which would provide facilities open to schools throughout the Glasgow area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A further point, which is not contained in that document, is that Strathclyde has offered to pay the travelling costs of children who have to travel from some distance, to ensure that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1310</span>
opportunities are available to children from all backgrounds and areas outwith the centre of Glasgow. The clear intention is to make the academy accessible so that schools throughout Glasgow can benefit from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for making that point as I was not aware of it. It is important to emphasise that the technology centre's resources would be available to pupils in the greater Glasgow area, which I would define in this context as including the constituency of Eastwood. That saves me asking my hon. Friend about the position of pupils in my constituency. I do not rule out the possibility of there being appropriate sites in Eastwood for a technology academy, would the problem of Allan Glen's become insuperable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If an academy can be placed in Solihull, one can certainly be placed in Eastwood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that there is a site in Eastwood which would be preferable to Allan Glen's. I define Eastwood for this purpose as including the whole constituency, including areas with a strong industrial tradition such as Barrhead.<br><br>
We are discussing a proposal that is in line with Scottish traditions. The concerns of the hon. Member for Fife, Central about the breadth of the curriculum are exaggerated, as clearly there will be a broad curriculum, and a more specialised one beyond secondary 4 level. It is an exciting concept, and I do not criticise Strathclyde regional council, as it has clearly been pulled in different directions. I hope that those who favour progress in Strathclyde will win the day and that the technology academy will be successfully established.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reject amendment No. 205. It is unreasonable and does not achieve the purpose stated by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. He said that he wanted to be sure that registered teachers would be responsible for the core curriculum, but the amendment would prevent people from being employed as teachers in technology academies under any circumstances unless they were registered teachers. The hon. Gentleman is, therefore, bound to be opposed to the policy of a regional technology centre because it would include university staff who would not usually be registered teachers. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways.<br><br>
The joint briefing paper states that
<br><blockquote><p>"registration as an independent school would require the Board of Governors to satisfy the HMI regarding the suitability of the teaching staff. In practice, this requirement would be fulfilled largely in terms of the registration system."</p></blockquote>
That seems to make perfect sense. Teachers in a technology academy who were teaching the normal range of subjects would be registered teachers. It is silly to rule out the employment of people who are not registered teachers, but who may have skills in technological areas. That is far too defensive and is likely to undermine the whole concept of a technology academy.<br><br>
Although tempted, I shall not discuss the other issues raised by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1311</span>
hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will agree that a technology academy could make a useful addition to the educational input to provide the skills of the future and that amendment No. 205 would be an unreasonable restriction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is one thing that we can all agree on it is that when competing with other advanced nations Britain suffers from a lack of sufficient technical and scientific training, particularly in the computer world. That is harming our economy. We must take steps to ensure that we educate young people in those spheres more effectively and that more young people are attracted to those areas than at present.<br><br>
It is well known that engineers with degree qualifications are often made to feel that they are somehow inferior to people who have degrees in other subjects which were no more difficult. There is a hierarchy of esteem, and our engineers feel that they are at the lower end of it. Other countries have cultures in which engineers are held in high esteem. That benefits the engineers and the economy of the country.<br><br>
If the Government seek to improve the technological performance of the country, they are going the wrong way about it. I would oppose the idea of setting up a technological academy even if we completely set aside the question of academic selection for it and assumed that pupils would be taken from across the spectrum of ability. Although we must take the lack of technological ability seriously, there are other ways to achieve it.<br><br>
There are two reasons why I oppose the idea. It has been defined briefly in the notes on clauses as a school which will have a broad curriculum with the emphasis on science and technology. We do not need to refer to elaborate books published by the Department of Education and Science to know that. If there is to be more emphasis on science and technology, there will be less emphasis on languages, social sciences and on the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Lady will take into account the fact that the technology academies will have a longer school day and a longer school year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is useful to know, although no information handed to Committee members has mentioned that. However, I am opposed to a longer school day and year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I explain why I oppose it first? Children competing for good passes, especially if their parents are ambitious for them, already have a long school day for their age level, after which they must do homework. Now the Minister is saying that they will do a longer school day and year. It is not good for them. Children need more free time than the Minister envisages. It is absurd to put children on a treadmill at the age of 11.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1312</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall give way to the Minister first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By way of information, the document we issued in October 1988, which set out details of the technology academies, included information about their operation. I suspect that it was on that basis that that excellent man Councillor Gray began to formulate his thinking. Therefore, it is not true that no information has been provided about Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough. I did not see that document. It would have been helpful to have that information here while we discuss the Bill. That does not negate my point. Either those children have an unbalanced curriculum or they will have a longer working day, as the Minister said, to allow time for those other subjects. That is not a reasonable approach, as children need free time. Already many parents with an understandable anxiety about their children's future have them spending a great deal of time on homework. I remember spending many hours at home after the school working day was over getting through homework. Children often spend more hours working for exams in and out of school than many adults put in their working day, since they can go home at 5 o' clock and forget about it. Children cannot I do that, especially when they are working towards final exams that will determine their future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to score points off the hon. Lady, but in case other members of the Committee are not aware of it, the October 1988 document to which I referred is on the Table in the Committee Room and available to those who have not yet seen it.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that we helpful, but we should get on with discussing the terms of the proposal instead of trying to score rather petty points.<br><br>
The Scottish education system is admired by many people outwith Scotland because of the breadth of education given to pupils in the same working day and year. A value of that system is that after two years' experience of various subjects, pupils can decide, at the end of their second year, where they want to go. Their teachers can advise them on the results of that two years' work. The Minister is now emphasising that pupils will still have that breadth of experience, but will simply have to take more time to achieve it. Pupils not in technology academies presumably will work normal school days and hours. To some extent those pupils will be less advantaged when trying to achieve passes because they will have spent less effort and time on those subjects. Therefore, some pupils will have much more time spent on them and will have to put in more time themselves to get their passes than those who attend other schools. That is not a reasonable approach to the education of our young people.<br><br>
I am anxious about the education of girls in Scotland. If the Minister has commented on that already, I am sure that he will inform me immediately of the relevant documents, but none of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1313</span>
interventions this morning have referred to it. After a normal primary education, few girls will be held to have demonstrated an aptitude for science and technology subjects. I worry about the consequence of technology academies, which are likely to attract more boys, who might be pushed toward them. Even in early infancy, boys can display an aptitude to such subjects and so they think naturally in that direction. However, few girls will be identified as having demonstrated the capacity for science and engineering by the age of 11.<br><br>
When they grow up, girls will be excluded from better-paid jobs, technology-based crafts and sciences. Women will still have to do low-paid office work, shopkeeping, nursing and all the other undervalued occupations. They will be less likely to get the jobs that depend on having craft and technical qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to develop the point, but I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 5 of the document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The academies would cater for the standard secondary age range 12–18 … They would draw pupils from a broad range of ability with a balance between the sexes and from a wide catchment area."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of the paragraph to which the Minister draws my attention, but how can he ensure that that will happen? I do not believe that many girls aged 11 will gravitate naturally towards technological and scientific education. They have to be encouraged to do so. Many people may not be certain whether it it appropriate to encourage girls in that way, so it would not happen in many cases. The girls themselves might not show much interest at the age of 11. Often, a girl's interest in physics, chemistry or computers develops late on in her secondary education, perhaps after much intensive encouragement from teachers who have seen those budding abilities. It is unlikely to happen in the case of most 11 year old girls, because they will not have developed an interest in those subjects and few people will have encouraged them to do so.<br><br>
In secondary schools with technology departments the curriculum is, in theory, open to both boys and girls. However, in reality, the girl pupils are not encouraged to study technological and scientific subjects. People take the attitude that it is unfeminine and that they are not the right subjects for girls to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady accept that, over the past three decades, it has been difficult to teach technology to both boys and girls because of the subject's image? That has occurred because, under the comprehensive system, it has been considered demeaning to study a subject that uses spanners and similar tools. Technology academies will try to change the image of the subject so that boys, girls and their parents will see the subject as a worthwhile one to pursue. The country desperately needs that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1314</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) did not hear the earlier part of my speech. I emphasised that I was aware of the fact that engineering and technology were not held in the high esteem that they should be. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need to do something about that.<br><br>
A reason why we do not have enough scientists and engineers is because we are wasting the resources of the female half of the population which has never been encouraged to study those subjects. When girls study them, it is often in the teeth of opposition from parents and teachers who tell them that the class is full and that it is not a proper subject for a girl to study. They are told that nice girls do not get their hands dirty. Unfortunately, those attitudes exist even today. I hope that the hon. Member for Tayside, North realises that the creation of technology academies, to which boys will more naturally gravitate, will make it even harder for girls to take up that type of education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will be aware of the new flying academy at Prestwick. Some girls are students at that academy and at least one of them has qualifications in engineering. They are learning to fly because the academy exists and they have the opportunity to go there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the interventions more and more amusing. I have actively encouraged girls to take up science and engineering over the past few years. As a Labour councillor in Glasgow, I helped women to do craft apprenticeships in the teeth of opposition from Conservative members of the council who said, "What nonsense. We do not want girls doing that kind of thing." Today, we are told that Conservatives think that it is wonderful for girls to do that and that technology academies will encourage them further. Tory Members are in disagreement with their friends on Glasgow district council about equal rights for women, so perhaps they should have discussions with them to sort them out rather than ask us to sort out our Labour colleagues in Strathclyde.<br><br>
We should not just consider the aptitude that girls show at the age of 11. If we take account of who is already qualified as teachers in those subjects, the academies will be staffed largely by men. Therefore, the few girls going to the academies will not have appropriate role models. That will reinforce their feeling that an interest in engineering or other craft skills is unfeminine. Boys see the world filled with men doing important and interesting scientific work, but girls do not have those examples. If hon. Members think that that is a trivial point, I assure them that it is not. I have spoken to girls about to leave school who have been contemplating a career in science and engineering. They cite that as one of the great psychological barriers that they have to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister agrees with me. I hope that he has thought about the problem and has found some way of resolving it. Girls need to be encouraged by the example of women who have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1315</span>
gone before them. I hope that the Minister will tell us how he will remove my fears, which are widely held by both men and women in Scotland who have tried to encourage girls into science and engineering.<br><br>
Reference has been made to Allan Glen's school and the high reputation that it had for those subjects. If the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) were here, I should point out to him that it was a boys' school. At that time, girls were not encouraged to take up those subjects. We have moved on from that view and even the Minister, who is reactionary in many respects, is at least progressive on this issue. As he is aware of the problem, I hope that he will tell us of the positive steps that he will propose.<br><br>
I was appalled by the contribution of the hon. Member for Eastwood on registered teachers in the academies. If we must have the academies, the pupils should be taught by qualified teachers. It is arrant nonsense to argue that if someone has a particular technical skill, that person is fit for teaching. Education suffered in the past from employing people who may have had first-class honours degrees, but who could not teach for the life of them. Teaching is not just about knowing a subject. It is about getting a message across, and the ablest people in a subject sometimes do not understand the difficulties of pupils who do not have the same natural aptitude for it. Such teachers cannot grasp why some children find the subject so difficult, because they found it so easy. We have teacher training and teacher registration to ensure that teachers carry out their educational duties competently. Pupils in Scotland need teachers who are as skilled in the craft of teaching as it is possible to make them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An article appeared in the Scottish press recently headed "Post-Govan strongman". It referred to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and it included the words
<br><blockquote><p>"McLeish has always been strong on arguments".</p></blockquote>
I kept that in mind as I listened to him this morning. I am afraid it was an inadequate speech which did not deal with the substance of the matter. He felt the ground moving beneath him and that was patently obvious to all.<br><br>
If the idea of technology academies had not been floated, Trusthouse Forte would not have pledged £1.5 million for Scottish education. That shows how the concept will bring in extra money and funds to improve Scottish education. It is not just a matter of doing that, but of introducing new ideas and of waking up education authorities throughout Scotland. I am delighted that Strathclyde is now trying to steal a march with a new technology centre of its own.<br><br>
The question is how to improve education, particularly technological education. I do not mind whether that improvement comes through the type of technology academy that is foreshadowed in clause 62 or through the initiative of a local authority, such as Strathclyde, in seeking to set up its own centre of technological excellence. That generates new ideas, which will benefit Scottish education.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1316</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is valiantly trying to tackle this subject. Does he agree with the Minister that even if Strathclyde does not want a technology academy, it will get one because the Government say that it should have one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much hope that the Minister is proved right. The likelihood is that it will get one. The experience of English local authorities and their attitudes towards CTCs in England has been discouraging. Far too often Labour-controlled local authorities have shown such hostility to CTCs that they have sought to freeze them out of their districts by denying them sites. By doing that, they are damaging the educational opportunities of children in their areas, particularly those who are growing up in the environments least likely to offer them a good educational future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best way of improving technological education in Scotland would be to have significant investment in all the comprehensive schools in Glasgow that currently offer such education, but which are under-resourced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is far better to concentrate on centres of excellence because they would have a ripple effect and improve standards outwards.<br><br>
Finally, it is nonsense to suggest that the academies envisaged in clause 62 are alien to Scottish education. They are right in line with the Scottish education tradition and are much to be encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because time is marching on. It is crucial for my hon. Friend the Minister to resist amendment No. 205. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) talked much abracadabra. It is not true that only those who have been through teacher training college have the God-given right and ability to teach children. Diversity and variety in education, especially in technological education, require us to take advantage of all those outside education who have much to offer in teaching children.<br><br>
The technology academies envisaged in the clause are supported by Strathclyde regional council, and the Labour party does not know what to do. It knows that the CTC equivalent for Scotland—the technology academy—will be established. As he marches—in the words of the Educational Institute of Scotland—hand-in-hand with my hon. Friend the Minister toward the promised land of educational opportunity, Charles Gray recognises that there is a prospect of raising educational standards in Scotland.<br><br>
I have examined the English CTCs. In Solihull, the school day starts at 8.15 am and ends at 4.30 pm. The hon. Member for Maryhill let the cat out of the bag just now when she said, "The poor little darlings cannot cope with all that work. The poor little darlings cannot cope with being stretched. The poor little darlings must not be stretched to the limits of their academic ability." The technology academies in Scotland will do precisely that. They will be the flagships for Scottish education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1317</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman had an hour and a quarter and I must leave my hon. Friend the Minister some time to respond to the debate.<br><br>
This clause offers the opportunity to implement in Scotland what the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) wants to see happen in the rest of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. Members of the Committee will no doubt have seen the articles in <i>The Times Scottish Education Supplement</i> of 5 May and <i>The Scotsman</i> of 6 May about Strathclyde region's reactions to the technology academy. <i>The Times Scottish Education Supplement</i> story suggests that Strathclyde wants to talk to the Government again about playing a part in managing an academy in Glasgow. <i>The Scotsman,</i> the very next day, quotes Councillor Gray as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing short of a compulsory purchase order will take Allan Glen's away from us."</p></blockquote>
I am not surprised by the inconsistency. After all, it is only a few months since Strathclyde last changed its mind on this issue. Before Christmas senior councillors were speaking to my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland about sharing the management of an academy in Glasgow. By February the region's ruling group had turned the idea down flat. I am also not at all dismayed to learn that the kite flown in <i>The Times Scottish Educational Supplement</i> has been so quickly shot down.<br><br>
I must make it absolutely clear for the benefit of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that the participation of an education authority is not required for the establishment of a technology academy. Indeed, Strathclyde had a unique opportunity to be the first education authority in Britain to be involved in this concept. Its leadership saw that, but its backwoodsmen shot it down. Naturally we are disappointed by that Luddite attitude, but it is important to note that technology academies will be owned and run by independent companies. They are not education authority schools.<br><br>
I am not surprised by the suggestion that Strathclyde wants to develop a "technology centre" in part of the Allan Glen's site, with the rest being used for offices. That plan was part of the proposal for participation in a technology academy which the ruling group in Strathclyde rejected earlier this year. Thanks to the hon. Member for Fife, Central we have been able to make copies available to the Committee. Under that plan the region's technology centre was to have had the opportunity of sharing in the resources and skills available at the academy. Now it seems it wants to go ahead with its own centre, but to deny it these advantages.<br><br>
That is a matter which it is up to the region to decide. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) said, we should welcome that development. However, if I were a community charge payer or a parent in Strathclyde I should want to know why the region turned down an opportunity to improve the facilities at its own proposed centre in the same breath as it tried to prevent the children of Glasgow getting an exciting and challenging new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1318</span>
educational opportunity. It seems bad business sense to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard extravagant language about "Luddites". The cosy relationships seem to have dissipated. Does the Minister not think that Strathclyde has a right as an education authority to debate an issue and to take a decision which may be contrary to Government policy? Will it be written into legislation that decisions taken by education authorities must conform with Government thinking? That is appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Education and Science came forward with a proposal and commended it to Conservative Members and it was voted down ignominiously, Labour Members would say that the Government had lost the confidence of their Back Benchers and should resign. No such suggestion has been made about a proposal which was put forward by the leader of Strathclyde and rejected. The convenor of the education committee was a party to it, and both the chief executive and the director of education signed it and agreed that it was a reasonable proposal to put to members as it was consistent with the principles of that education authority.<br><br>
If I wished to be cynical, I would say that there are some positive signs in the announcements now being made by Strathclyde councillors. I see that they are keen to attract private sponsorship for their technology centre. I see, too, that they regard it as a centre of excellence which will give spin-off benefits to other schools in the region. Both of those points are key parts of the technology academy policy. I am glad to see that Strathclyde has understood our policy so clearly and is determined to carry it out—or perhaps, as with school boards, Strathclyde councillors would prefer me to say that they invented the idea. The evidence is all there before us in <i>The Scotsman</i> of Saturday 6 May, where Councillor Green is said to have spoken of
<br><blockquote><p>"a centre of excellence…bringing in private sector funds…staff with industrial experience, not necessarily trained teachers"—</p></blockquote>
not necessarily trained teachers. So he would not be voting for this amendment. It is all there—the noise of a hundred tiny hammers, as the gnomes in Strathclyde's workshop busily re-invent yet another wheel. Even in Strathclyde, there is a recognition that the broad thrust of the Government's policies is popular with the voters, and no doubt the forthcoming regional elections will help to concentrate some minds.<br><br>
I have to say to the hon. Member for Fife, Central that I have some sympathy with his position today. The ability of Strathclyde region to make public announcements a few days before the hon. Gentleman has to struggle through these Committee proceedings, can only be co-ordinated by some malign influence in Strathclyde. I cannot believe that it is a coincidence because it happens so frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister would like to act as a Minister for a moment. We know what is happening in Strathclyde as a result of detailed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0744">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1319</span>
discussions that we have had with the education department there. The earlier part of the Minister's speech when he described Strathclyde as Luddites and gnomes was more entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman knows what is happening in Strathclyde, he should have a word with the councillors in Strathclyde so that he can tell them. To judge from the press cuttings, there has been a series of stormy meetings and we read even today that the leader of Strathclyde has rapped the knuckles of the officials, who have been made scapegoats for the lack of a clear, coherent response. We do not criticise Strathclyde;—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is, and as a result of our policies, the Labour party in Strathclyde is having to change its position. We welcome that. The pity is that Opposition Members in this House have not followed its example.<br><br>
Several points were raised in the debate. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) was concerned about sexism and that there would not be enough encouragement for girls. I agree with her. That is a reason why we wish to establish technology academies. She is obviously unaware that the head of the first technology academy in Britain, or CTC as it is known south of the border, is a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that there is often a token woman, but what percentage of women will be in those posts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I know of the difficulties which that particular lady has to face, I think that the use of the word "token" is entirely inappropriate. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) mentioned the hon. Lady's remark about the extra work that the kids would be doing. I shall send her a copy of "A Few Thoughts From Our First Year Students" on "Life at the 1st CTC". I shall read one extract, which is from Richard Wilcox, aged 11. He states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that all of the pupils who come in the future will like it as much as all of the pupils here do now. I hope to spend all of my years in secondary school here. When I am older I would like to send my children to a CTC. Coming to a CTC is one of the best educations somebody could have and I am proud to be part of it."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady mocks that, but children taking a pride in their school and having a commitment to what they are doing is central to the Government's policy. She would do well to read the comments of the children because <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> says that we do not talk enough about children in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am not knocking children's pride in their school. I am wondering what this has to do with ensuring that girls are given an appropriate share of technological and scientific education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the girls, Sally Earl, said it was
<br><blockquote><p>"Very exciting and never boring".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1320</span>
Another girl, Melanie Griffiths, aged 11 said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Inside is even better than outside."</p></blockquote>
So the hon. Lady would do well to look at those comments. She said that there should be a balanced intake between the sexes.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central kept referring to "licensed teachers." That is an English term. In Scotland the term used is "registered teachers"— registered with the GTC. "Licensed teachers" is an English term for people educated beyond A-level who have not received formal teacher training, but are permitted to work in an LEA. To refer to "registered teachers" in Scotland as "licensed teachers" is considered offensive by the EIS and others, so the hon. Gentleman may find himself on the receiving end of criticism when his masters have read the proceedings of the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman argued that the technology resource centre would provide a broader facility than a technology academy. Technology academies will have a 12 to 18-year-old school population and a broad catchment area. A technology resource centre is likely to be for senior pupils only.<br><br>
The clause allows for the establishment of privately sponsored technology academies as another means of widening the range and diversity of schools available to parents. It is a new and exciting initiative, but the Opposition's response has been predictable. They are unwilling to accept the need for change.<br><br>
The initiative has been challenged on several grounds. The usual hoary old chestnuts have been put forward—that it is a vote of no-confidence in public-sector schools, that resources should be used for the benefit of public-sector schools and that technology academies will be selective and better off financially. None of those arguments has been substantiated. Typically, the Opposition fail to see the opportunity that this initiative provides for raising standards and expectations of pupils, parents and teachers throughout the school system. During our debate it became apparent that Opposition Members had not even read some of the papers on this matter before criticising the policy. Technology academies will provide free of charge a broadly-based secondary education with a strong emphasis on technology and scientific subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will be elitist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is elitist why was Councillor Charles Gray prepared to accept such schools in Strathclyde? Is Councillor Gray in favour of elitist education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should ask Mr. Gray that question. Technology academies are only about selection and creaming. They avoid the real needs of all Scottish schoolchildren. The Minister has not dealt with that and other points raised in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People will note that the Labour party Front Bench spokesman not only denied the authority of the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0745">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1321</span>
Straw) to make policy pronouncements on education, but refused to defend the Labour leader of Scotland's largest education authority. I invited the hon. Member for Fife, Central to withdraw the accusation of elitism, given that Councillor Charles Gray supported technology academies and he did not.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman would do well to follow Strathclyde's example because the technology academies which Councillor Gray is prepared to endorse are broadly-based and have a strong emphasis on technological and scientific subjects. They will adopt the best teaching and management practices as well as develop new and approved approaches to teaching and learning. They will develop the qualities which employers in industry and commerce seek and they will be specifically designed to encourage pupils to achieve their maximum potential and to equip themselves well for their adult life and work in an advanced industrial society. As such they should offer a distinct ethos with a strong emphasis on self-discipline, motivation and positive attitudes. Do Opposition Members object to such aims? Certainly the leadership of Strathclyde does not.<br><br>
It is also intended that technology academies will take pupils with a wide range of abilities. Pupils will be selected not primarily on the grounds of academic ability, but on their aptitude and readiness to take advantage of the type of education offered. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
