	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[continuation from col. 996]</p>
	<p>3.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak at this stage or at all, but—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> We keep getting threats—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a suggestion. The hon. Gentleman does not make suggestions. A characteristic of this Committee is that we have been subjected to threats. Apart from the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) keeps making threats about those he will write to, those he will publish things about and so on. I can understand the hon. Member for Eastwood saying that, but it is unacceptable for the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes to make threats. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman laughs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not made threats. I merely told the Committee how I would vote on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A threat has two aspects: first, what is said and secondly the method by which it is delivered. When it is delivered with an increasing crescendo of words and the hon. Member jumps up and down and becomes hysterical it is a disgraceful threat. The Bill is important to Scottish Labour Members and to our constitutents, for whom it has serious implications. It has no such implications for the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes. He threatened, "Don't worry about the Minister's commitments. If we get cheesed-off, petulant or angry or because you do not do as we say, we shall make sure the Minister reneges on his commitments."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself reneged on his commitments. Before we broke for that delicious cup of coffee, he said that the commitments would be scrubbed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not mislead the Committee. I said no such thing. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) said that if Opposition Members did not accept the commitment, he presumed that they would not withdraw the amendment. He was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
persuaded during the debate to be accommodating and therefore suggested to the Committee that the amendment should not be withdrawn and that he would vote against it because it was technically defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and his hon Friends put my commitment at risk. That is entirely of the hon. Gentleman's own making. My undertaking remains. It was given in good faith and it is on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has gone back on what he said. Hon. Gentlemen called across the Committee Room that we had blown it, because that was what the Minister said. He now says that there is a commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should take account of the other members of the Committee. I do not control Conservative Members. They are free agents. As Members of Parliament, they make their own judgments. They are susceptible to argument and to the Opposition's behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise my hon. Friend's, but it is for them to decide whether they will take my advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why we are debating the issue. The Minister said, in effect, that he cannot make commitments because he is in the hands of his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman assure me that he speaks on behalf of the Labour Front Bench? If so, will the Labour Front Bench accept the Minister's assurance that he deals with flawed amendments in the proper, parliamentary way? If the hon. Gentleman will not accept that assurance, he is playing hostage to fortune with the usual parliamentary practices. He should not, therefore, be surprised if, in defending their rights, Back-Bench Members vote as they think proper because of the failure of Front-Bench Members to deliver a commitment on behalf of their party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a serious matter. He says that commitments given by the Minister can be overriden by Back Benchers. The amendment is correct and would enhance the Bill. The hon. Gentleman will enable legislation to be passed out of pure spite and petulance. The people of Scotland will get second-rate legislation just because hon. Members are upset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Friend? I am appalled. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. My hon. Friend the Minister speaks with authority on behalf of the Government. He has no implicit or explicit authority over Back-Bench Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that. That is why we raise the issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that we should tease out these matters. Before our break, the Minister said,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
"You've blown it, it's all off." He gave a commitment, said that we raised worthwhile issues and agreed to consider them. But in a fit of pique and spite he said, "That's it. It's all off."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman misrepresent what I said? If the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends were prepared to accept my undertakings, they should have withdrawn the amendment so that we could proceed. Some time has passed since I gave the commitment, so I assume that the Opposition will not withdraw the amendment. I told them that it is technically defective and that we will vote against it. If they intend to withdraw the amendment, why do they detain the Committee with further discussions after my clear commitment? When I said that the hon. Gentleman had blown it, I was observing the demeanour of my hon. Friends. They are extremely irritated that Opposition members, to whom the Government gave a commitment, should filibuster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you confirm that the hon. Member who moves an amendment usually decides whether the amendment should be withdrawn? The hon. Member may then beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is the property of the Committee. It is for the hon. Member who moved the amendment to ask the Committee's leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you are grateful for the assistance of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, Mr. Martin, just in case you make a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the Minister, as I said earlier, I did not intend to speak in this part of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not being frivolous, but is the hon. Gentleman speaking from the Front Bench on behalf of his party? He has not answered that question. Regardless of what his hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said about who asked the leave of the Committee, it is important in these procedures that we understand the duties of both sides. My hon. Friend speaks on behalf of the Government. Is the hon. Gentleman speaking from the Front Bench on behalf of his party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am. I understand the obsession of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) with these matters. I did not intend to speak in the debate. What persuaded me to do so was the Minister's comment before the sitting was suspended that we had blown it and it was all off. Suddenly I realised that his commitment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) to stand on a seat while addressing the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had not noticed that the hon. Gentleman was standing on a seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have had one foot on the seat, but I did not realise that that was standing on the seat. I thought that the definition was to be on two feet. Let us not mind the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rose because of the Minister's remarks. He gave us the distinct impression that the commitments that he had given us had suddenly been removed. Clearly he has backtracked. He has had second thoughts. He gave a commitment and then reneged on it. Then he realised that that would not look at all good, so he begins to backtrack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say again what the hon. Gentleman appears deliberately to fail to understand. I gave the Opposition a commitment that I would be prepared to consider their amendments again if they withdrew them now. They have to seek the Committee's leave to withdraw their amendments, and it is up to the Committee to decide. Nothing has changed. I give the hon. Gentleman some advice. He seeks to persuade the Committee of his commitment to improving the Bill, but he and his colleagues have a funny way of doing so, having taken up the Committee's time after a commitment was given. They give the clear impression that they are more concerned with time wasting than with improving the Bill. It is difficult to form any other conclusion, after their behaviour tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not listening, so I say again that I did not intend to speak in this part of the debate. I did so only as a result of his remarks before the sitting was suspended. He gave the impression that he was reneging on his commitments. He says that he is not doing so, and I am pleased to accept that assurance. I always understood that it was in the nature of Committee debates that we should try to ascertain what Ministers and others had said. The Minister says that he is not withdrawing his commitment, which stands, and I am happy to accept his word. All this would have been avoided if he had not shouted abuse across the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have made useful points. It is important to register the fact that all hon. Members have every right to contribute to any debate. If the Government were not so over-sensitive about finishing the business, some of their more intemperate remarks would not have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that, at times, this has been a high-spirited Committee, but there is no place in any forum for veiled threats about the behaviour of hon. Members in response to amendments that may be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because his hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that every hon. Member has a right to speak, I asked the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) a question, but he failed to answer. A reply is important to the conduct of the Committee. It is equally important to understand who speaks with authority. Who speaks on behalf of the Front
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
Bench? Is it the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend, who refused to answer? We understand that there is no question but that the hon. Member for Fife, Central speaks for the Front Bench, but does his hon. Friend also speak on its behalf?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. I will speak for the Front Bench. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) responded to the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) in a rather high-spirited intervention. He suggested that he was here to ensure that the Minister did not backslide. We are becoming used to these veiled threats that if hon. Members dare waste—in Government eyes—the time of the Committee, there will be trouble. We might have accepted a proposal that if we withdraw our amendments the Government would put something in their place, but hon. Members become a bit excited and threaten the Committee. Such behaviour is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that hon. Members seemed to doubt the Minister's assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you confirm that I have made no threat, to anyone about anything. I merely suggested how I might be minded to vote when the issue is resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is expressing an opinion. I accept that he was not making a threat but it is up to other hon. Members to decide how to interpret a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North made an interesting comment about some of my colleagues taking a less charitable view of the Minister's assurances than I might wish to take in the next few minutes. That was occasioned largely by certain changes that were made and by certain assurances that we thought had been given but that may end up as empty gestures. That is why some of my hon. Friends have adopted a certain attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Reports of our debates will be read and it is important that we maintain a degree of seriousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is at one as regards the principle underlying the amendments. The Minister gave what I consider to be a fair commitment; some Opposition Members doubt whether it is. Surely it is up to the Minister to make good his commitment. If he fails to do so, Opposition Members have an opportunity to come back at Report. It is in the interests of the Committee making progress, and of good legislation, that, having made their point, the Opposition should now withdraw their amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable comment. My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), who moved the amendment, may seek the Committee's leave to withdraw it. You confirmed on a procedural point, Mr. Martin, that that was his prerogative. As he moved the amendment, it is not up to me to withdraw
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
it. Suffice it to say that I think that the amendment should be withdrawn, in view of the Minister's earlier assurances. However, if hon. Members then decide that they wish to discuss it, is that a reason in itself for all sorts of doubts about the credibility or sincerity of the Opposition? I do not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What concerns me is that the Minister gave those assurances not a few moments ago but an hour and a half ago, at the beginning of the debate. His assurances of a few minutes ago were in no material way any different from those that he gave earlier. It was the nature of the debate, and the way in which the Opposition have conducted it, that prompted my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept qualified apologies from the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes for his earlier contributions. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) makes a valid point. I may, in error, have suggested that he gave those assurances a few minutes ago, although he may have done so a bit further back, in the early hours of the morning. I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have made clear what the amendments would do. I want to stress another serious point. This is one of the very few Committees that, from its second sitting, has sat into the early hours of the next day. Conservative Members talk about clocking up hours and I think that the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) said that we have sat for perhaps 87 or 90 hours. However, much of that time has been unproductive—[Hon. Members: "Oh."]—because the Government have taken a Bill of importance to Scotland and had it discussed at the silliest hours imaginable. That is why you get letters, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give evidence of the concern in Scotland. Scotland is 400 miles north of London and there is concern there about issues that rarely percolate down to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is a serious statement, why did the Opposition renege on the deal that would have meant that the discussion on clause 28, clearly a major clause, would have started at noon today when the press would have been present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government Whip would like the Committee to discuss that issue, I am willing to take part in the discussion, with your forbearance, Mr. Martin. However, I suspect that not every hon. Member wishes to discuss it. I do not know whether the Government Whip is moving sideways or up and down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need not even talk in terms of deals. We can deal with what is on the record of the Committee. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if Opposition Members had curtailed their speeches we would have reached clause 28 not at noon but probably by 11.30 am when the press would have been present? We would have been fresh at that time and this important matter would have been discussed seriously and reported back to the Scottish people. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1003</span>
is solely as a result of long and largely irrelevant speeches by Opposition Members that we are now discussing the matter at 3.45 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has the option of discussing further confidential matters that have been taken up. Conservative Members are pointing at the clock and becoming agitated. They talk about trying to finish early but they continue to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful to return to the question of the ludicrous amount of time that has been allowed for consultation with various organisations in Scotland. I have here a paper from the Church of Scotland. It is from the Rev. James A. Roy, MA, BD, Presbytery Office, 3 Cooper Angus Road, Dundee DD2 3HG.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the telex number?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a telex number but I have a telephone number. It is 0382 611415. The paper is an extract from the minutes of a meeting held at Meadowside, St. Paul's church halls, Dundee on 12 April 1989,
	<br><blockquote><p>"which place and day the Presbytery of Dundee met pursuant to resolution for Ordinary Business and was duly constituted.
	<div class='ul'>	<li>	<i>Inter alia:</i></li>
	<li>	<i>EDUCATION COMMITTEE: REPORT:</i></li>

I do not want to burden the Committee or stretch your tolerance, Mr. Martin, by talking about those concerns, but I also have here a letter that is germane to the religious issues often dragged out by Conservative Members. It is from the Church of Scotland to the Minister. It is dated 11 April and is from the Church of Scotland's department of education, 121 George Street. It makes an interesting comment. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the Scotsman's report (10/4/89) on your speech"—</p></blockquote>
the Minister's speech—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the Scottish Young Conservatives, reference is made to your 'mocking' the Church of Scotland for making submissions to the Government on testing, opting out and other matters without saying a word about religious education."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for bringing that to my attention. It is not really relevant to amendment No. 140 and the other amendments in the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is particularly germane to amendment No. 195, because it relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles in relation to denominational schools, and to the wider question of religion raised in the Education Reform Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
I am grateful to you for bringing me back to the amendment, Mr. Martin, but the author of the letter which I have just quoted did say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"without saying a word about religious education."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I could send you a very considerable number of submissions made to the Scottish Education Department over the years on the matter of religious education."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We clearly heard you tell the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that he was straying from the amendment, but he then went on as before. He was out of order and is that not partly why we are in the present situation? To quote you, Mr. Martin, no sensible person would be here at this time. The Opposition have got themselves into an appalling mess because they have no manager to sort them out, keep them in order and tell them how to run the business, and they simply ignore what the Chair tells them about staying in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order, but may I say to all hon. Members and not only to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), that if they confine their remarks to the amendments, it will be helpful to the good conduct of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the advice of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) on Committee procedure, but I am struck by the fact that this well-organised Government machine which has taken the rare step of being inquorate twice has also managed not to say no when a significant amendment was moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am willing to accept your ruling, Mr. Martin. We have made our point and it is my wish that the amendment be withdrawn, but I think that it is up to my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles to take that matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anybody has a right to become impatient at the length of the debate, it is I who moved the amendment, but having listened to the Minister, I shall beg leave to withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am still not entirely convinced that I was wrong when I mentioned the Education Reform Act 1988 and suggested that opted-out schools would not have the choice of pursuing a form of religious education that was not predominantly Christian, because the sections of the Act to which the Minister referred me deal only with schools that remain under local education authority control. The Minister may wish to reply further to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 18, line 32, leave out 'one month' and insert 'three months'
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important because in clause 28, line 32 is about consultation. The amendment seeks
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
to extend the period of consultation. Clause 28(7) would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"three months beginning with the date of publication of the proposals any person may submit representation to the Secretary of State as regards the proposals."</p></blockquote>
Within the context of clause 28 it is important to maximise the consultation period because the issues involved are considerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is getting on for five to four in the morning and I know that hon. Members are anxious to make progress. I am happy to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment, so perhaps we can move on to further consideration of the Bill. A period of three months is eminently sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is asking me to extend my charity somewhat, bearing in mind the extraordinary behaviour of Conservative Members on the previous set of amendments. In a fit of politicial pique, Conservative Members indulged in a mass voting down of our reasoned and considered amendments, which the Minister found easy to accept originally because he was keen to disappear to get his flight to Edinburgh. However, after the political knock-about the amendments were voted down by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members now feel great anxiety because the Minister is happy to accept amendment No. 154 to extend the consultation period from one month to three months. It will be useful to find out why the Minister wants to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend speculate on the reaction in Scotland when it is learned that English MPs voted down a series of amendments that were acceptable to Scottish Opposition Members and the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I draw your attention to the intervention from the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). His remarks had nothing to do with amendment No. 154 which extends the consultation period from one month to three months. I hope that you, Mr. Martin, have noted that once again Opposition Members are straying from the amendment simply to filibuster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was consulting with the Clerk when the hon. Member for Western Isles intervened and I did not hear what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central, in considering how to proceed, was how the Scottish press and people would react when they heard that a group of amendments that the Minister was prepared to accept—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you confirm that at no time during the discussion on the last set of amendments did I say that I was
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
prepared to accept them? I asked Opposition Members to withdraw the amendments on the basis that I would come back with a proposal on Report. It cannot be right for the hon. Gentleman to mislead the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The last set of amendments have been discussed and what is done is done. We cannot go over old ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the Committee's hands, but I find it difficult to understand why amendment No. 154 cannot be dealt with quickly. I hope that hon. Members will bear in mind that when both sides of the Committee have agreed on a matter it should be dealt with quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair, Mr. Martin, I was on my feet when my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles intervened and there was a further intervention. I do not want to continue the debate on amendment No. 154 but it is stretching the Committee's credibility when Conservative Members behave in an extraordinary way on one set of amendments and because they want to leave—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The previous set of amendments were discussed for more than an hour and a half. I cannot allow hon. Members to go back over old ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my intention, Mr. Martin. I was speaking to amendment No. 154 and the Minister intervened to make life easy for the Committee by accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not privy to Government secrets, but it will be virtually impossible for any sober-minded and objective person to resist an application by the Leader of the House to timetable the Bill when the Opposition's leading spokesman filibusters his own amendment after it has been accepted by my hon. Friend the Minister. The hon. Gentleman has been told categorically by the impartial Committee Chairman that he should draw his remarks to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have the opportunity, Mr. Martin. I shall do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he would accept amendment No. 154. I do not need further interventions to suggest what we may, or may not do. We do not intend to go over old ground on the earlier set of amendments. They were dealt with decisively by the Government. We may not like what happened, but it has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern about clause 28 is that there will not be a clause stand part debate. Opposition Members are not willing to accept, reject or withdraw amendments until pertinent points have been made. I am not trying to stretch your tolerance, Mr. Martin, or the Committee's at this hour, but a point of principle is involved. There will be no clause stand part debate and despite the criticism levelled at my hon. Friends by Conservative Members, we want our questions answered to ensure that our arguments for amendments are recorded in the 	<i>Official Report.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in the House for only a short time, but I have not known a situation in Committee where a Minister has accepted an amendment and we have not proceeded to the next business. I was persuaded on reflection that three months was more appropriate than one month. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) suggested three months for self-governing schools. On a change of character, three months seems reasonable; the extra month might be required as an additional protection. The hon. Gentleman has obtained a significant concession and I am astonished that he is not accepting that graciously and allowing the Committee to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now being asked to accept the Minister's views graciously. We are pleased to note that the amendment has been accepted and will be written into the Bill. The nod has been given, so we should deal with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment. Our patience has been excessively tried in the Committee. The Minister gave a clear assurance to the Opposition that he would accept amendment No. 154 and not move Government amendment No. 187. That was a considerable concession. I have been in the House for 10 years, and any reasonable Committee during that time would have automatically accepted such a concession. The Opposition Front Bench spokesman, supported by his hon. Friends, would have simply got up and said, "We are grateful to the Government for acceding to our arguments. Thank you very much. Let's get on".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. It is clear that the Opposition Front Bench is wasting time—in order, I hasten to add, Mr. Martin—and I urge my Back Bench colleagues to vote against my hon. Friend the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 154.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to understand why the Minister readily accepts the amendment. On 18 April we debated clause 17(3), as reported in columns 802 and 803 of 	<i>Hansard.</i> The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) moved an amendment on the time limit in which people could make representations to the Secretary of State. He asked for a two-month rather than a one-month period, as the Bill originally provided. I tabled an amendment seeking to extend the period to three calendar months. The Minister rejected my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepts amendment No. 154, will clause 17(3) be amended on Report to ensure consistency throughout the Bill? We have had contradictory statements—one allowing a two-month period and the other three months. The Minister should explain clearly why he now believes that three months is better. I agree with him, but we are entitled to a logical explanation of this sudden change of mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) is correct about the lack of consistency. It must be placed on record that when my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) tried to comment briefly on the amendment, he was subjected to endless interruption by Conservative Members who are now accusing us of wasting time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative Benches are in a shambles. Get them sorted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I distinctly heard the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) say to my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), "Get them sorted out." Conservative Members have an affable and friendly relationship with everyone, be they Whips, Ministers or whoever, but we make up our own minds. Can it be placed on record that the hon. Gentleman said, "Get them sorted out"? That may be how he deals with his colleagues, but my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border does not deal with us in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was too busy listening to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). It would be easier to listen to the hon. Lady if everyone else were silent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It was not a point of order. I ask the Committee to settle down and allow the hon. Member for Maryhill to have the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give them some valium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are getting too excited and should calm down. As I was pointing out before the interruptions from Conservative Members, my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central was trying to comment on the amendment and welcome the Minister's acceptance of the extension of the period to three months, when he was subjected to endless interruption. It must also be placed on record that the Minister whispered something to the Conservative Back Benchers involved. I can only conclude that he encouraged them to object to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should not draw such conclusions. I was given the message that my hon. Friends were becoming extremely agitated by the behaviour of Opposition Members and that some of them were not inclined to take my advice. I suggested to them that it would be sensible to take my advice. By prolonging this discussion, the hon. Lady is making it more difficult for me to persuade my hon. Friends to accept the amendment. If she takes my advice, she will allow the Committee to proceed to the next business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give in to such veiled threats, any more than my colleagues did on the previous amendment. If the Minister was trying to persuade
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
Conservative Members to accept his leadership on the amendment, he made a rotten job of it because they seem to be defying him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt the Minister's sincerity. We want a period of three months to be accepted, but the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) is correct in pointing out the inconsistency in the Bill. It seems that we tried the patience of Conservative Members to the point where they altered the previous clause in an unhelpful manner, but, because they want to get to their beds, they are now ready to accept our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Conservative Members behave in this way, they are punishing not Opposition Members but the people of Scotland who will be affected by the nonsensical refusals to accept reasonable amendments. They had better remember that, because the Scottish people will notice their behaviour and give them the correct punishment at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The best course of action is for us to have a five-minute recess. We reconvene at a quarter past four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.9 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>4.15 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be convenient to the Committee if I deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and explain to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) that I wish him to support the amendment, not because it has been graciously put forward by the Opposition—that argument would not find much favour with him at this hour—but because it is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray asked me to explain what she described as an inconsistency, but there is no inconsistency. When I accepted the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood for two months rather than the hon. Lady's amendment for three months during our earlier discussion on the length of time following a proposal being put forward to the Secretary of State, I resisted the hon. Lady's amendment because it would lengthen the discussion on self-governing status within a school. I wished to keep those discussions as short as possible to minimise disruption in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to the period during which representations can be made on a change of status. A change of character would be fundamental. Some would argue that it is more important than the decision to opt for self-governing status, but that is a matter of opinion. However, the key point is that no other process can be followed. Therefore, by accepting three months instead of two months, the process is not extended because it is a single process in itself. It is desirable to accept the Opposition's amendment because it will give further protection to those who are worried about the provisions that allow for change of character. Therefore, there is no inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
I understand why my hon. Friends are incensed by the Opposition's time-wasting tactics in the early hours of the morning and also why my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is incensed by the Opposition's refusal to accept yes to one of their amendments. However, I ask my hon. Friends to support the amendment. I am prepared to accept it and the Opposition know that it will add to the strength of the Bill and to its proper checks and balances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to assuage the fear of Conservative Members, I must say that these are probing amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are structured in such a way as to provide, with your tolerance, Mr. Martin, a formal debate which will compensate for the lack of a stand part debate on clause 28. The amendments provide an opportunity to discuss matters arising from clauses 2, 16(2), 16(4) and 28, which cover special needs, aptitude and ability, changing the provision of education within schools and the priority given to children within traditional catchment areas. We want to assist the Committee by providing a basis for solid, constructive and worthwhile debate. As a consequence of that, we do not intend to press the amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For "probing" could we substitute the words "searching around in the fog"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I could accept all of that phrase. "Searching around" may be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important debate. Many Conservative Members have strong views about selection and about the characteristics of a school being changed. They will be grateful that the Opposition have the foresight, wisdom and dynamism to give them the opportunity for a wide-ranging debate at this time on Wednesday morning. We can search out—not necessarily in the fog—the matters with which hon. Members wish to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not criticise the selection of amendments, but we want to consider all the issues
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
that are at stake. We view the debate as a substitute for the stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you confirm whether there will be a stand part debate on clause 28? I understand that there may not be such a debate. If I am right, will you rule that we cannot use debate on amendments as a substitute for a stand part debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already had the stand part debate. There will be no further debate of that type. This group of amendments ranges wide and the remarks made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) are in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee will accept your ruling, but surely the hon. Gentleman was out of order when he suggested that the debate on the amendments is a substitute for the stand part debate. There cannot be a substitute for a stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I answered that point. It is unfair to pick on every word that an hon. Member uses. We know what the hon. Member meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood is a seasoned and professional politician.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Battle-scarred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one characteristic that may or may not change as the debate proceeds. I accept that I inferred that the debate would be useful for the Committee. It will not be a formal stand part debate as the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes suggested, but it will raise some important issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend devised the amendments neither to add to nor detract from the substance of the Bill. They were structured to provide a wide-ranging debate. Perhaps Conservative Members will intervene to tell us what they believe the amendments add to the Bill and why they hope that they will be put to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted if Conservative Members spoke in the debate, but the extraneous mischief that they might wish to indulge in will be superflous to our object of providing a forum for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Brigg and Cleethorpe raised the important point that many issues have philosophical and political implications. Clearly, a technical debate in Committee is not the best forum to debate matters of that kind, but they will appreciate that the amendments are so wide-ranging that they will have the opportunity to tell us what they think about academic selection. They will also be able to put on record their views about comprehensive education. That will show us whether they have learnt any lessons about special needs, which have frequently
	<span class='label label-info column'>1012</span>
been debated. As we know, the Bill provides that special needs schools will be able to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could also deal with the wider concerns. The debate will open up several vistas, and some clear questions will be asked of the Government. Does the Minister support the development of comprehensive education in Scotland? Will he firm up his commitment to academic selection regardless of whether we mean aptitude or ability or the concept of giftedness that we discussed earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I inform the hon. Gentleman that I shall not answer questions that do not specifically apply to the amendments. We have had a stand part debate and discussed the wider issues. I shall confine my remarks to the substance of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may not be the best time to question Ministers or other members of the Committee. However, the amendments are structured in such a way as to allow those specific questions to be asked. We shall be talking about academic selection, about special needs and about access to schools. We shall also have a wider debate on rural areas. We tabled a series of amendments that would give the best opportunity to highlight the issues.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister may not wish to answer any specific questions about the two issues that I have raised already—academic selection and comprehensive education—they lie at the heart of the debate. Our deliberations would be incomplete if the Minister's views on the future of comprehensive education were not put on the record. Comprehensive education offers equality of opportunity for all, free of charge, and, by virtue of its historic development, it operates in a consistent and cohesive manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Academic attainment in Scottish secondary schools should be considered in that context. It is useful to refer to a paper prepared for COSLA by, dare I mention it, the Centre for Educational Sociology at Edinburgh university. The footnote states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"CES is an independent research organisation founded in 1972. It is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom and by other public bodies."</p></blockquote>
I think that the Scottish Office is one of those other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While attacking the concept of academic selection, it seems more positive to look at what has been achieved in Scottish schools, to look at standards and to see how Scottish education compares with education in the rest of Great Britain. The paper is dated April 1989 and is entitled "Standards of Attainment in Scottish Secondary Schools". Its conclusive response to whether standards have risen or fallen is that they have risen. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proportion of young people leaving school with SCE awards at O grade or Higher has risen steadily from 65 per cent. in the mid 1970s to 77 per cent. in 1986. The proportion of school leavers passing Highers has risen in this period from 27 per cent. to 33 per cent., and the proportion getting at least one O grade at A-C grade has gone up from 57 per cent. to 66 per cent. In 1965,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
the year that comprehensive reorganisation was introduced, only i8 per cent. of school leavers had passed Highers, and only 30 per cent. had passed at least one O grade with or without Highers."</p></blockquote>
How does Scotland compare with the rest of Britain? The report concludes that secondary schooling in Scotland is as good as if not better than education in the rest of Britain. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish school system is distinctive, and comparisons with south of the Border do not always tell the whole story. This said, Scotland emerges well on all reasonable comparisons. For example, the proportion of young Scots who chose to stay on in full-time education after 16 years in school or college has risen steadily in the past ten years or so. It was estimated to be 46 per cent. in 1985. This was four percentage points higher than the estimate for England and Wales."</p></blockquote>
In earlier debates I have pointed out that statistics taken in isolation can be misleading. They can be used out of context, and it is unfair to suggest on these raw figures that the achievement in Scotland is higher than in England and Wales without adding the caveat that factors may be at work in both countries which determine the nature and quality of the statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On academic selection, the Government have made great play of the fact that some schools should specialise in what the report on giftedness which I discussed previously described as particular skills in dance, music or the arts. Nobody would dispute that those skills should be developed. Several education authority schools already offer those specialities. We are opposed to the reintroduction of general academic selection whereby pupils are admitted to the school only if they reach a certain level of academic ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise, Mr. Martin, that the problem of how one defines academic ability could consume the Committee's energy for a few hours. I have tried to make the simplistic point that we could talk about aptitude and ability or the definition that was included in the paper on giftedness. However, there is a widely-held perception in Scotland that academic selection refers to testing children at 11 and using the results to decide where a child should go for his or her secondary education. Prior to the introduction of comprehensive education, there was a clear distinction between pupils at that age going on to a high school and pupils going on to a junior or secondary school. As hon. Members have pointed out, that often did not make a material difference. The hon. Member for Tayside, North does not agree; he has made his views quite clear on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is anxiety that any suggestion about academic selection would create a division in education which most Scots, most educationists, most parents and most teachers would not wish to see return. The point has been made that academic selection requires a form of testing, and there has been much debate in the Scottish press this week about maths testing. My hon. Friends may wish to go into this in greater depth. Testing is crucial to academic selection, and it can be a difficult, complex exercise to analyse with any objectivity. That is especially so if it is child-centred and related to what is best for the child and is measured against his or her potential rather than against some normative standard which I believe the Government are interested in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
One thing leads to another in this analysis. If we accept that the comprehensive system is doing a good job in Scotland—it can always be improved, and we make no bones about that—we have to accept that it means by definition non-selection. Selection by academic ability opens up all those areas of testing. We shall return to the problem of national normative testing as against what is widely carried out in Scottish schools, namely diagnostic testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's comments closely. Is he saying that there are no circumstances in which children should be tested on their aptitude for a particular skill. It could be a skill in music and dance, but it could also be in soccer or rugby. Is he not flying in the face of real life? There is some form of testing for every job. That is certainly true of professional soccer players, airline pilots or any jobs in which tactile skills are important. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there are no circumstances in which children should be tested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a fairly fundamental issue, which I shall try to answer. My principal concern is about academic selection, which we can leave ill-defined. By that I mean basing the selection of secondary education for 11-year-old children on a test. In the general run of academic testing, I am opposed to a system whereby children are posted on to secondary schools on the basis of passing a test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Tayside, North was here when we previously discussed giftedness and comprehensive education, but I agree that it is a difficult area. There is clearly a case for schools that take children with particular aptitudes for specific skills in certain cultural or physical activities. I asked for a wider definition of the words "aptitude" and "ability" in clause 16(4). It is a difficult area, and we do not have all the answers. I hope that the integrity of my initial position is accepted. I am opposed to a narrow definition of academic selection at the age of 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A sequence of events can be identified which leads from the abandonment of comprehensive principles to academic selection and a form of testing. Ideologically, those who support the comprehensive system are supposed to be Labour voters or Socialists, whereas it is suggested that those on the Conservative Right must support selection. However, the debate must be more sensitive than that because children of 11 are fairly fragile and vulnerable. In many respects, it is still early days for comprehensive education— 20 years is an infancy in educational development. It is essentially a sound system, and we should mobilise opinion to develop it further rather than allow it to be undermined by self-governing schools whose characteristics can be changed significantly after five or three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, we have identified about 80 rural secondary schools which would be very vulnerable if they opted out. We are opposed to the general principle of academic selection, but there are rural areas that are particularly vulnerable and where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1015</span>
discrimination against a child on the basis of academic selection could impose enormous burdens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's list. Will he tell us where some of the schools are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have looked closely at the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), the Highland region, Banff and Buchan—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), that is where the vulnerability lies. Where parental choice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>5.16 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were discussing the niral environment and the vulnerability of some schools. Clauses 16 and 28 allow characteristics to be changed. My hon. Friends will discuss in more detail other characteristics, but the almost 80 schools that we have identified will face major problems if, for any reason, admission arrangements are changed to allow progression from primary school to secondary school. The Government, euphemistically, say that that is based on aptitude and ability, but to the Opposition it means academic selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government always throw up the argument of parental choice to justify major changes. In fact, that is how they justify the entire Bill. The definition of choice is crucial, especially when academic selection can exclude from a school many children whose parents may not have a great deal of choice. We shall be back to the situation of a few years ago when we invested in failure by testing children and dividing them on the basis of the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in an earlier debate, the Minister said that because of the vulnerability of rural schools the Secretary of State would exercise considerable caution in considering a request for self-governing status. The Opposition felt that because of the extraordinary circumstances of rural areas, such schools should not be allowed to opt out. But we lost that debate on primary school limits and we await with interest to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
see what further assurances will be given on secondary schools in rural areas. School rolls are low compared to schools in urban areas, which have 1,000 plus pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that in parts of the Western isles and Tiree, school rolls were very small. That raises complex and related matters that we cannot discuss on this group of amendments on balloting the parents involved in a school opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people believe that selecting pupils according to their academic ability is the opposite of parental choice. A system of education that seeks to provide equal access and opportunity to a range of children, regardless of their ability, allows—at least at one stage—the continuity of peer groups and of groups of children from similar backgrounds going automatically to the secondary schools in their catchment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disturbing that academic selection would be not only educationally, but socially, divisive, as my hon. Friend for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) pointed out earlier. We cannot entertain that. There is no consensus in Scotland for the introduction of academic selection. Whether or not it is being pushed for ideological reasons, there is no pressure for it from parents, educationists, teachers or local authority representatives throughout Scotland. If there is evidence to the contrary, it would help if it were forthcoming in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many organisations in Scotland sent briefings to all members of the Committee; they are worried about the concept of aptitude and ability. As the sun rises and daylight appears, it would be far too easy to suggest that we should not discuss such matters in detail, but it is tempting to try to reopen the debate on what constitutes aptitude and ability. However, I shall resist that temptation and merely point out that if the Government are serious about academic selection, we should have a debate on it. We should not confuse and distort the issue by talking about dance schools or other cultural activities and subsume those characteristics under the heading of aptitude and ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Comprehensive" has a specific meaning in Scottish education: it means "non-selective". When we consider the concepts of equal access and opportunity and, more importantly, the concept of equal worth, we must remember that there is nothing more morally correct than exposing children to a decent primary education and giving them an equal opportunity at secondary level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mixed ability classes in secondary schools are often criticised. In the early days of mixed-ability teaching, it could have been argued that some children— because of the method of teaching—suffered. But in most progressive schools children are in composite classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can illustrate the point without incurring the opprobrium of Conservative Members by referring to my children. They have been in composite classes and are now in a secondary school with mixed-ability classes and are progressing differently. Every child cannot be stuck at the same level at the same time. There is true mixed-ability
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1017</span>
teaching in my children's school. It is excellent for the children, it is rewarding for the teacher and it means that during the essential first two years of comprehensive education they are in mixedability classes but are not getting equal-ability teaching. If children need extra help in a comprehensive system, they get it. If such a concept is broken up for what may be attractive ideological reasons, ultimately it could damage fundamentally standards in secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North made a valuable point about training at a later stage. The concept of comprehensive education must be widened greatly. At present primary education in Scotland is excellent in the main, but it could be improved, and it is better in some areas than others. We have a comprehensive system which investment, resources and sympathetic treatment could further develop. However, we want to extend the concept of comprehensive education so that it also covers the concept of learning for life. It is in that regard that training, including access problems and funding, becomes crucial. The hon. Member for Tayside, North is right. Schools should not be about training, but where specific skills are required for specific industries, training must be a function not only of industry, but of the training organisations and further education colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we call comprehensive education is often ill defined. Truly comprehensive education includes provision for the under-fives, for those in primary schools, secondary schools, further education colleges and beyond. That is what we should be debating, not the educationally damaging concepts in clause 28, and the provisions in clause 16(4) which allow for the possible reintroduction of academic selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking to the amendment, I have taken the opportunity to talk about academic selection. The amendment is useful in that it allows comments to be relevant to a particular part of clause 28. I am sure that as the debate develops, my hon. Friends and Conservative Members will want to contribute to this subject and the other issues raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to a crucial issue—the threat to the comprehensive system posed by the vigorous pursuit, in terms of concept, of the new Right regarding academic selection and education policy. It is clear from what my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said that it is difficult to engage people in Scotland in serious conversation about opting-out. It is not so much the technicalities of the Bill that are important, but the Government and Back-Bench thinking behind the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The material that we have debated considers the new Right and its education reforms. Those reforms are not only worrying, but if the Government achieve support for them in the community, which is unlikely or—what is more disturbing—if they win another term of office, they have the potential to damage fundamentally the fabric of Scottish education. If that happens, the foundations established through the Government's concept of boards of management and self-governing schools will provide the launch pad for a much more aggressive attack on comprehensive education and for the further
	<span class='label label-info column'>1018</span>
development of independent, private education. The independent sector does not have much of a foothold in Scotland—with 32,000 children involved, it is no grave threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of value for money and the excessive costs involved in the independent sector, a wider debate should be held about the two aspects of independent education. I refer to the value-for-money concept of investment and education audits in the independent sector. The Minister is concerned about the funding of research organisations which may or may not come up with material that will generate controversy. It might be an idea to have a wider debate on the efficiency and contribution of independent education. Perhaps the Minister could sponsor a study to compare the best comprehensive schools in Scotland with the major independent schools, whether in Edinburgh or Glasgow. Apart from prep schools, I do not think that there are any independent schools in Fife. That study would represent an interesting development in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Government's criticism that when we attack independent education it is always because of the privilege and politics involved. I accept that the debate should be about the educational worth of such institutions. Will the Minister offer a research programme to undertake such a study?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to take up the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred last week to Greeks bearing gifts, when dealing effectively with two or three welcome or unwelcome gifts.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has responded positively and I hope that we shall for the first time have the kind of research programme that the Minister said he would consider. I expect no more. Such a programme would allow informed debate in Scotland on the Opposition's arguments in defence of comprehensive education and the Government's arguments in defence of the independent sector. Along with the value for money and educational audit aspects, that could add a new dimension to the debate, which might take us further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that, apart from Conservative Members being bored by this contribution, it is getting lighter outside, which brings a different perspective to the debate. We view seriously the introduction of academic selection in Scottish schools. We cannot support it, and our intention has been to highlight our concern. I await with interest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), but I cannot understand his contrast between the independent sector and comprehensive schools.

The only qualification is that the parents have enough dosh to pay the fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister undertakes research into the educational worth of independent schools, he should complete the unfinished assessment of achievement programme and publish the research that formed the basis for the interim report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I hope that the Minister has noted his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 159 will give the Government a final opportunity in this Committee to answer questions that we asked previously about how they propose to deal with the impact on a school that, instead of taking pupils of both sexes, decides to take only girls or only boys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have talked all along about the alleged advantages for parents who vote for the school to become a single-sex school. They have avoided telling us what they propose to do about either the girls or the boys who are disadvantaged by that decision. Can the Government get to grips with the problems that that will create? Time is running short. The Bill is nearly through its Committee stage and it will not be long before it returns to the Floor of the House. Sooner or later the Government will have to say how they propose to deal with the problem of the imbalance that will be created in other mixed schools—perhaps in the mixed school that is nearest to the one that has become single sex. Do they think it is acceptable that because one school has become single sex, a neighbouring school will be obliged to take a disproportionate number of children of the other sex? That could have an impact on the behaviour in that school and the way in which the teachers had to cope with problems. If the Minister cannot see that, I wonder what he is doing in charge of Scottish education, as it is obvious common sense to the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue that the Minister has evaded is how far it is reasonable to expect children to travel in the event of their schools deciding to accept only children of the other sex. In Glasgow, they may not have to travel an unreasonable distance, although parents there tend to complain if their children have to travel a couple of miles. Their difficulties would be negligible compared to those of children in rural areas. For example, from Callander to Stirling the road journey is difficult. Somebody calculated it as 40 miles, which I find scarcely credible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it surprising, too. It is certainly a considerable distance. Conservative Back Bench
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
Members have no idea what the distance is, but they sit there happily pushing the legislation through. The Minister has just admitted that it is about 12 miles. Surely that is not a reasonable distance to expect children to travel every day, just because a bunch of parents have decided to make a local school single sex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members assume, for some reason, that single-sex education is better for the children concerned. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who is not present now, assumes that that is particularly so for girls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is approaching an important matter—the value of education in single-sex schools. Did my hon. Friend attend such a school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I attended a single-sex school. I have no complaints about the education that I received there, but feel that in many ways it is better for the two sexes to mix together from earliest childhood. They should grow up accustomed to one another and not find the opposite sex a strange category of being, whom they hardly get to meet until they have left school. That is not a good idea for children's social development. It is one of the reasons why I would abolish such schools as Eton. Such an upbringing is positively harmful to children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for telling us that she went to a single-sex school, as her experience gives great weight to her argument. Which single-sex school did she attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why my hon. Friend wishes to know, but it was Notre Dame high school. At that time, the school was selective in terms of academic achievement, but it accepted children from a wide social range. They simply had to pass the entrance exam. Those who ran the school in my day suffered from no sense of inferiority to those who ran single-sex schools for boys. Girls are often brought up to think that they should remain passively in the background, to act as helpmates to the opposite sex. The woman who ran the school that I attended had no such attitudes, and that must have rubbed off on me and some of my mates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to discuss whether comprehensive schools lowered standards. Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) asked whether the Conservative party was hostile to the idea of comprehensive schools. When he asked what Conservative Members thought of them, a Conservative Member answered "Not a lot." They are flying in the face of the facts for all children, especially girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A summary of 10 years of research into Scottish comprehensive schools says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The balance of evidence from a ten-year study of all Scotland's secondary schools is that comprehensive schooling has raised the examination attainment of pupils from all types of social background. The improvement has been more marked for young people from disadvantaged social backgrounds. This is probably because relatively few such youngsters had done well in the sytem of selective secondary schooling that comprehensive schools replaced. Girls too have done relatively well as comprehensive reorganisation has progressed.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1021</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Some figures illustrate these changes. Among girls in the mid 1970s whose fathers were in manual jobs, 49 per cent. left school with one or more O grades at A-C. By the mid 1980s this figure had risen to 64 per cent., an increase of 15 percentage points. There was also an increase among their male counterparts but it was smaller, from 48 to 57 per cent. For girls from non-manual backgrounds, the increase over the same period was from 83 to 89 per cent. For boys from similar backgrounds it was from 82 to 87 per cent. Thus the attainment of all groups improved, but girls and pupils from less advantaged backgrounds improved more.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Comprehensive reorganisation increased the 'social mix' of secondary schools (ie the extent to which pupils in each school in a community were a representative cross-section of all pupils in that community). Where social mix was increased, as it was especially in the major cities and in authorities like Fife, there were marked improvements in the academic attainment of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. In the New Towns— Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Irvine, Glenrothes and Livingston— there was almost a complete social mix in the schools in the mid 1980s. In these communities the effect of social background on attainment was much smaller than in Scotland as a whole."</p></blockquote>
The summary shows that children from the bottom of the social scale whose fathers had manual jobs did better in comprehensives than in the old selective schools. Girls did better than under the old selective system, whether their fathers were manual or clerical workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are flying in the face of the evidence by introducing the Bill and accepting that some schools—we do not know how many— may become single-sex schools. They may think that this will be to the advantage of girls or boys, but they are utterly mistaken. There is no advantage to either sex. Even the sex that the Government think will gain an advantage will not do so. The other sex will obviously be put at a disadvantage by being forced to go to a school further away, where the mix of the sexes may be disproportionate. I cannot imagine trying to run a school where three quarters of the pupils are boys and only a quarter are girls. I hope that I shall not offend my hon. Friends if I say that girls are held to be a civilising influence in a school. If there are too few of them, it is more difficult for teachers to achieve discipline. Girls are generally quieter and better behaved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish. Which school did my hon. Friend go to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my all-girls school there was no belt. All those years ago there was no corporal punishment because teachers did not need it. We were not all angels, but we certainly did not require the belt to keep us in order. There were other methods that might have been considered cruel or unusual punishment, but teachers did not have the belt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood implied that Strathclyde regional council had a policy to phase out single-sex schools. I tried to make him realise that my point of view was not completely coterminous with Strathclyde region's point of view. However, the council has no policy on that issue.

A working party recently considered sex equality in the education service and single-sex education and decided that persuasive arguments could be produced in either direction. So no policy recommendation was put to the regional council.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
Decisions taken by the council in 1988 will result in two sets of amalgamations involving single-sex schools and resulting in new co-educational establishments. In both cases, the main considerations influencing the council were the existence of large numbers of surplus places and the unsuitability of some of the accommodation currently in use. Both amalgamations will result in schools that are educationally viable and occupy modern premises, well suited to current requirements.

It is unfair to attack Strathclyde regional council when representatives cannot be here to explain their position. It is, therefore, important to put their view on the record. No Conservative Member has sought to intervene in this debate. They may be drifting off to sleep at a quarter to six in the morning, but I hope that they will answer those serious points about the education of our people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pick up on the final point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill. The remarkable silence from Conservative Members has lasted for the entire debate. It is odd that there has not been a peep from them because 20 hours ago they were bursting to get to clause 28 so that they could deploy an amazing tactic. But there they all sit silent, glum and miserable. Although I encouraged my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central to give way, none of them took the opportunity to make their brilliant manoeuvre. I offer the same invitation to them to speak, and I wonder what they are planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the only brilliant manoeuvre performed recently by the majority of Conservative Members to absent themselves from the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been more weird and wonderful manouevres than that—to wit, voting against the preferences of their own Minister. The Minister wanted a group of amendments to be withdrawn because he accepted the spirit of them in principle and wished to produce technically correct amendments, but that opportunity was denied him by his Back Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to try your patience, Mr. Martin, but the record will show clearly that Opposition Members threw away an opportunity for me to reconsider the matter by their desire to waste time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is no way for Back Benchers to behave.

Amendment No. 156 would prohibit changes to nursery, primary or secondary provision in the characteristics of opted-out schools. It is right that opted-out schools should be inhibited in changing those characteristics. Dropping the provision for nursery education, for example, would have considerable ramifications in the area that uses that nursery provision. The people affected should have an opportunity to prevent a school from dispensing with its provision in that way. Therefore, it is right to inhibit a school's ability to change that characteristic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 157 would prevent opted-out schools from changing the characteristics that affect children with special education needs. It seeks to guarantee that the existing provision that schools are required to make for children with special education needs is not diminished or undermined when schools gain opted-out status. Until the Government give that hard guarantee, we reserve the right to be extremely sceptical of the bland assurances that we receive in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 158 would prevent opted-out schools from changing their characteristics in terms of their ability to admit pupils on the basis of aptitude or academic ability. My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill dealt with amendment No. 159 in some detail and to good effect. It would prevent opted-out schools from changing their characteristics as single-sex, or non-single-sex, schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is baffling that schools should be segregated still according to sex, to a physical characteristic. It is unfair and wrong that a school should be able to change from being co-ed to single-sex and so exclude one sex from access to that school. In this day and age it is baffling that anyone should think that one's sex is germane to one's ability to enter a school. That is astonishing. What next? If the principle of physical characteristics having an effect were extended, that could result in schools only for short or for tall people, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A bald school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. A prematurely bald young person's school might not be a bad idea. One could argue that they shared various social problems and, in that sense, they might wish to come together in a particular school. I do not accept the argument, but if one believes that physical characteristics are relevant to one's ability to enter a school, one must extend that argument to its utterly absurd conclusion. Amendment No. 159 is appropriate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 160 would prevent opted-out schools from changing their denominational characteristics. I said earlier that opted-out schools in England and Wales did not provide the opportunity, as Conservative Members seem to think that they do, to establish Islamic schools, for example. The provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
require predominantly Christian education. The sections to which the Minister drew my attention do not refer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 158 would prevent opted-out schools from excluding children on the grounds of general academic ability. We told the Committee earlier why we think that such exclusion is profoundly wrong and why it is important that children from all backgrounds and abilities have the opportunity to mix and mingle together. We refer not just to children who will move into the fast stream of society but to children who will lead different lives after leaving school. At least for the time that they are at school, they will learn about the expectations, conditions and backgrounds of their fellow pupils who will at some point become their fellow men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's argument against our attempt to prohibit academic selection is that comprehensive education has failed. My hon Friends the Members for Fife, Central and for Maryhill cited research that showed that comprehensive education had increased the attainments of children from all social backgrounds and of all abilities. The only evidence that the Minister dwelt on to prove that comprehensive education was not achieving its goal. He referred to the interim report from the Northern College of Education which he wrongly and ridiculously interpreted as containing evidence for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that the Minister should show such a lack of judgment in assessing the value of a report, which is far from finished, and statistics over which there are many question marks. For example, Andrew McPherson says that it is not possible to tell from the statistics that there has been a drop in the attainment standards of pupils. He referred to the samples that were taken in 1983 and 1988, which vary considerably and which would have had an impact on the statistics and a comparison that could be made between those two samples. He includes relevant matters, such as that since 1983, children with special education needs have been included in the mainstream, so are more likely to have been counted in the 1988 sample, which would affect the results. We do not know whether they were included in the 1988 sample as the Minister has not published details of those samples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. McPherson said, too, that the age composition in the classes has become younger. That would also explain why the attainment results were so much lower. He cites a series of factors that would lead, other things being equal, to a probability of the 1988 sample showing lower attainment results than the 1983 sample.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), with his knowledge of the Highlands, will agree that the most telling single factor in the 1988 sample showing a drop in the attainment levels, compared with the 1983 sample, was a substantial undersampling of pupils in the central belt area. The 1983 sample was biased and included a disproportinately high number of pupils from the Highlands and Islands, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1025</span>
would tend to make the attainment standards of that sample so much higher than a sample including pupils from the central belt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two samples are not comparable and would need much work to make them so, but apparently the Minister swallowed the report without questioning the statistics. He said that such figures "leave no doubt", but the assessment was a half-finished and highly imperfect statistical exercise. That shows nothing short of naivety on the Minister's part. I am tempted to call it statistical illiteracy, but I shall say that his hopes and wishes got the better of him and that his heart ruled his intellect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister, in making a fool of himself, is a good example of why we should not accept reports on their face value? Reports on scientific work are disputed backwards and forwards until eventually they are refined and accepted. The majority of reports are contested and some may be wrong. We must never select the things that suit our point of view before they are properly analysed and discussed. We should always wait for the passage of time. Nobel laureates do not receive their prizes immediately; they must wait a sufficient time for their findings to be examined and proved. Watson and Crick were different; their findings were accepted by their peers from the start. I am not comparing the Minister with Watson and Crick, but I am sure that he will agree that that is not the way in which to handle scientific material.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. If that is the way in which the Minister handles scientific material, I am sure that he is rushing out to buy shares in test tubes in anticipation of fusion in test tubes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said, such studies must be open to examination by the peers of those who have conducted them. I understand that the Minister has still not revealed the bases of the research sample for the 1988 group. He has released the conclusions, but not the bases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even without peer criticism, I should have thought that anyone who is faced with conclusions derived from statistics would look behind them before making a judgment on them. The Minister did not do that and now suffers from embarrassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 157. I seek to probe the Minister further on special educational needs. I look forward to the amendments that he has promised to clauses 28 and 16(4)(b). I refer the Minister to his commitment in column 238 of our earlier proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that he suggested that a school could increase its provision of special needs by a decision of the board of management, but that that provision could not be reduced other than through the full proceedings embodied in clause 28. Will he explain why that process must be followed? There is the danger of a conflict of interest. As the Scottish Parent Teacher Council said, there is no guarantee
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
that a self-governing school will not be able to reduce the provision for the minority of children with special educational needs against the wishes of the parents. We are discussing a minority. It is important to try to persuade the majority of parents that the action being taken is relevant to a particular section of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful to remind ourselves of what we define as special education in Scotland and to read not only the Warnock report recommendations but also the report by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools in 1978, entitled, "The Education of Pupils with Learning Difficulties in Primary and Secondary Schools in Scotland; a progress report by HM Inspectors of Schools."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is generally known as the progress report. It sets out clearly how special educational needs should be handled in our schools. Unfortunately, some of the wording of the Warnock report, which was published at the same time, was not as clear as we had hoped. The progress report was based on the Education (Scotland) Act 1969, which moved away from the idea of disability of mind or body and required local authorities to provide education by special means that were appropriate to the pupils whose physical, intellectual, emotional or social development could not, in the opinion of the education authority, adequately be promoted by ordinary methods of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation was that the emphasis should be on the requirements of the pupils, not of an amorphous body. My training was based on that and on the Piaget theory that education should be child-centred. The progress report also stated that it is important to consider those needs against the characteristics of individual children, school factors, the neighbourhood, the family and other resources, and to consider interaction between those factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to bear those aspects in mind when considering clause 28. I wish to hear from the Minister exactly what he intends to do to take account of those clear recommendations on the education of children with special needs and to avoid a conflict of interest in schools where there may be a danger of the minority being overlooked by the majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I am interested in what the Minister will say and I may wish to speak again after his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed some hours ago that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was staring anxiously out of the window. I assume that, like me, he was worried about what had happened to his hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and for Hexham (Mr. Amos). They seem to have lost all interest in our debate on the clause, to which they said earlier they were keenly looking forward. Perhaps they have other priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drink.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps drink and getting back to their coffins, now that it is daylight. I do not know what they are doing, but they are certainly not in the Committee debating the clause or showing interest in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1027</span>
I was struck by the Minister's intervention when my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central introduced the amendments. The Minister said that he would confine his comments to the substance of the amendments and the issues arising from them. It would be interesting to know what the Minister meant. The purpose of tabling the amendments was to raise general issues concerning clause 28 and to seek clarification. If the Minister refuses to speak about the general issues, we must conclude that he seeks to exploit the amendments for his own narrow party political purposes and to misrepresent the nature of the debate. I hope that that is not so and that he will seriously consider the points that we have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (12), to which the amendments refer, defines what constitutes the characteristics of a school. They are set out in clause 16(4). The purpose of the amendments is to define those characteristics specifically so that the Minister may clarify for the Committee the implications of allowing each characteristic to remain part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 156 includes a definition of special education, selection by ability, single-sex schools and denominational schools, but excludes a definition of the age range that may be a characteristic of the school—whether it provides primary and secondary education, nursery classes, and whether the number of yearly stages is four, five, six or even fewer. The purpose of the amendment is to provide an opportunity for a debate on the consequences if self-governing schools change the age range of pupils for which they cater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment came from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. It is accepted, as the Minister said, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A school may legitimately wish to expand provision for preschool pupils in a nursery class, to add S5 and S6 to a four-year secondary school, or even to drop S5 and S6 from a six-year school due to changing circumstances."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21 March 1989, c.220.]</p></blockquote>
But the Minister must state whether he accepts the other side of that argument—that any such changes may both enhance and restrict the choices available to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA gave an example. A secondary school that opts for self-governing status may have spare capacity and may decide to use that to establish a primary department, but it would do so only if it was confident in its ability to attract pupils. The purpose of the COSLA amendment is to ask the Secretary of State to consider the obvious consequences for primary schools in the area. If a new primary department is set up and attracts pupils from other primary schools, there will be implications for those other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of Blackshade primary school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) which had 170 pupils. The Tory regional council concluded that it was not viable to have a primary school with 170 pupils and decided to close it. The Secretary of State for Scotland, who has long absented himself from our debates, agreed
	<span class='label label-info column'>1028</span>
with the Tory council, despite the fact that the local councillor and Member of Parliament, local people and local parents campaigned long and hard to retain the school. The Tory administration in Tayside, backed the Tory Secretary of State, no doubt supported by the Minister—the hon. Member for Stirling—decided that 170 pupils was not a viable number and that the school must close. If a self-governing school opens a new primary department and attracts pupils from other schools whose rolls then drop to approximately 170 pupils, the implication must be that those schools will close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must reply to several questions. What will he do when a new primary department in a self-governing school makes other schools unviable? When considering such proposals, will the Secretary of State take into account the interests of all the children in the area, or only the interests of the self-governing school? Will he make a decision on the basis of what the parents and board of management of the school want and will they have the Secretary of State's support regardless of the possible impact on children attending other primary schools? How will the Secretary of State balance the wishes of parents whose choice may be increased by self-governing schools with those of parents whose choice may be restricted because they wish to send their children to education authority schools but may be denied that choice because the Minister takes account only of the interests of self-governing schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State approve such changes in a school's characteristics only if they increase choice for all parents and pupils in a given area, and not just for parents who choose to send their children to a self-governing school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will take advantage of these technical amendments to clarify the Government's position on these important matters. He must make clear to the Committee and to people outside the Committee how clause 28 will operate in relation to clause 16(4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council, with which the Minister claims to have a close relationship, says, commenting on the COSLA amendment— amendment No, 156:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Changing the age range catered for could have wide ranging repercussions on other schools in the locality".</p></blockquote>
Even the Minister must accept that, but he has not dealt with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SPTC says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Demographic changes which can have an effect on school rolls do occur."</p></blockquote>
The Minister knows that. He is for ever preaching to education authorities that the demographic changes that are taking place have implications for school rolls and for the provision of education, whether through the education authority or through the new self-governing schools. Will falling rolls mean closure in the education authority sector, but growth in the new self-governing sector, which will be a privileged sector that attracts better funding than education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The STPC states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not realistic to prohibit any changes to the characteristics of a self-governing school"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
I do not agree, but I am sure that the Minister does—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but any changes should only be allowed following wide consultation and debate after achieving the support of two thirds of the parents eligible to vote."</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting to hear whether the Minister agrees with the SPTC that no changes should be allowed, except where two thirds of the parents, who are eligible, vote for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SPTC continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This would indicate that parents believe such changes to be in the best interests of the school."</p></blockquote>
We would like to know what the Minister intends with regard to changes in a characteristic such as the age range of a school. Will he take into consideration the impact of such a change on education authority schools in the area? Will he take decisions on the basis of all the children and parents in the area, or will he base his decisions exclusively on the interests of schools that go for self-governing status and thereby disadvantage those that remain within the education authority sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. I am sure that all Members of the Committee were fascinated by the explanation of the amendments. They were apparently intended to provide an opportunity to probe and discuss the effects of clause 28, which we have discussed several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any of the amendments would remove the protection against change that we built into the Bill. Under the amendments, no ballot would be required before a school could introduce selection or change its denominational status or any of its other characteristics. The board of management could simply put forward a proposal to change the school's character without any prior test of parents' opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition seem, once again, to want to bring the Bill into line with English legislation. Under the English Act, no further ballot is required when a grant-maintained school wants to change its character. The governing body can simply take a decision, and submit it to the Secretary of State if there are objections. Similarly, in Scotland, local authorities can take such decisions about their schools after a simple process of consultation. We have gone out of our way to set up two hurdles that a self-governing school must clear—first, a ballot of parents, and then a submission to the Secretary of State. The amendment would kick away the most important of those hurdles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to see the amendments on the amendment paper. I know that some of my hon. Friends were tempted to support them, but I hope that they will accept the assurances given by Opposition Members that they tabled the amendments not for their meaning, but to provide an opportunity for discussion—at 6.25 am, as opposed to yesterday afternoon, which might have been the original intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will not be tempted to follow the advice that the hon. Member for Fife, Central gave us through the press, when he said that if the Bill followed English legislation in one part, why not go the whole hog? It would be unwise for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
my hon. Friends to go down that road. I hope that they will treat the amendments as probing amendments and not embarrass Opposition Members by taking the meaning of the amendments to be their intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that they were good amendments. I do not always consider the explanation for amendments—I simply consider the effect. I think that the effect of the amendments would be excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it is important for the balloting provision to be retained as a protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition made it clear that they were not certain about the meaning of their amendments. They tabled them simply to give us an opportunity to discuss the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister not perturbed by the intervention of his hon. Friend, who said that he understood that the amendments would kick away the provision for a ballot, and he therefore thought that they were excellent amendments? The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes does not believe that parents should be given a choice. He thinks that proposals should be imposed by the board of management. Does the Minister not find that surprising? No Opposition Member shares that perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no Opposition Member shares that perspective, I am surprised that they tabled the amendments, because that would have been their effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the hon. Gentleman would have done if, as I did a few hours ago, I had recommended that the Committee accept the amendments. Presumably, we should have had another lengthy debate, with Opposition Members explaining why it would be a bad idea for us to accept an amendment they tabled. I must impress upon the Opposition the fact that when they table amendments, it is important for them to consider the meaning. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes is perfectly entitled to take the view that it might have been sensible to accept the amendments—the Opposition have consistently told us that they want to bring the Bill into line with the Education Reform Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ballot test for a change in characteristics is unique to the Bill. It was introduced as a further safeguard. We have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that a self-governing school will not be able to change its characteristics without passing a number of public and rigorous tests. First, the board of management must pass a resolution to seek a change in characteristics, then it must consult the education authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that first a resolution must be passed. The notes on clauses, which the Minister kindly provided to members of the Committee, say that a board of management
	<br><blockquote><p>"must first consult on that proposition before passing a resolution to seek such a change".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the position was clear, but I shall check. The hon.

I stand corrected. It is always as well not to read what is put in front of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation with the education authority is an important part of the process. The education authority is, after all, responsible for provision of education throughout its area and it is proper that its views should be sought and taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which clause—other than clause 28—gives a board of management the power to change the characteristics of a school?

	<p>6.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will consider what amendment No. 158 does. It simply removes the requirement to go through the ballot procedure to achieve a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Subsection (1) refers to the list of characteristics which the board of management has the right, by resolution, to seek to change. The characteristics are listed in clause 16. If ability and aptitude are dropped from the list of characteristics referred to in subsection (1), the board of management has no power to change that characteristic.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question that I asked the Minister was where in the Bill does the board of management have the power to change the characteristics of a school—other than in clause 28. The characteristics that the board of management has the power to alter are given in clause 28(1). Our amendments seek to alter the list of characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments do not deal with the powers of the Secretary of State, but with the powers of the board of management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am anxious that the Committee should have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
correct information. The Minister says that, under clause 2(2), the Secretary of State has the power to change the characteristics of a school, but the notes on clauses say that clause 2(2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"provides for the Secretary of State by order to make or vary the scheme of Government of a self-governing school, but adds the qualification that if any variation of the scheme of Government would affect the characteristics of the school as listed under clause 16(4), it should be made in accordance with the procedure for such a change as provided for under clause 28(9)."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is a matter of argument and not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister to point to the clause that gives the board of management the power to change the characteristics of a school. The list of characteristics is given in clause 28(1). Our amendment seeks to change that list of characteristics, and would thus change the only power that the board of management has to change the characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the powers of the Secretary of State but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has just said, the Secretary of State's powers are also conditional upon clause 28. The Minister is wrong in both cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. Clause 28(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the board of management of a self-governing school after the appropriate consultation decide, by a resolution passed at a meeting of the board, to seek a change in the characteristics of the school, they shall secure that a ballot of parents on the question of whether the change should be made is held in accordance with this section."</p></blockquote>
The amendments relate to subsection (12), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In subsection (1) above, the reference to characteristics of the school is to the matters stated and specified in the description of the school required by section 16(4) of this Act".</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendments would be to remove each characteristic from the balloting procedure. [Hon. Members: "No."] If hon. Members wish to make speeches they can do so and set out their case. Once again, I have had to explain to the Opposition what their amendments mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong, and will, I think, eventually see that he is. Subsection (1) says that the board of management may, by resolution, with a ballot, seek a change in the characteristics of the school. Subsection (12) defines those characteristics which the board of management may seek to change, and those characteristics are listed in clause 16. If we change the definition, we change the board of management's power to change those characteristics. The amendments remove certain of the characteristics that it is within the board of management's power to change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The board of management can change anything that it likes that is not a characteristic in terms of clause 28(12). If clause 28(12) excludes a part of clause 16(4) from being a characteristic, the board can change it, in the same way as it can make changes in uniform and other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks me to get some legal advice. Among the people whom he has kept sitting up all night while wasting the time of the Committee are those who have been involved in drafting the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that the Opposition, after tabling amendments the effects of which they clearly do not understand, in order to protect themselves from the opprobrium that they would bring on themselves introduced them by saying that they were tabled solely for the purpose of provoking a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the beginning, Mr. Martin, that as there was to be no stand part debate on the clause, we were attempting to clarify matters by introducing a set of amendments. If the amendments had used the word "exclude" rather than "insert", clause 16(4)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) would variously have been excluded from clause 28(12), although those paragraphs do not appear there in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the start that the probing amendments were a genuine attempt to provide a peg on which to hang a discussion of related issues that had emerged on clause 2, clause 16(4) and on earlier parts of clause 28. The Minister cannot get away with saying that we did not know what we were doing. Several organisations were involved in drafting the amendments, which represent a genuine attempt to probe and to facilitate debate. I hope that the Minister will accept the good faith with which I began my contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is reasonable for the hon. Gentleman to say that although he tabled the amendments he is not interested in what they mean.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
They may be probing amendments designed to provoke a debate and he may have no intention of dividing the Committee on them. He may not wish to put them to the Committee, although some of my hon. Friends were attracted to them. It is not reasonable for his hon. Friends to argue that the amendments do something that they do not and then to try to make me explain why the amendments do not mean what they think they should mean. I have given the Committee my interpretation of their meaning, according to the advice that I have received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members say that we are wrong, but I do not know why they wish to press that case so strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister one more opportunity to tell us which clause would give the board of management the power to change characteristics by, for example, allowing schools to admit pupils on the basis of general academic ability. He mentioned clause 2, but that was not appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman asks me that question. The board of management can change anything that it likes which is not covered by clause 28(12) and clause 16(4). The amendments would exclude parts of clause 16(4) which specify various basic characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister say that the board of management can change anything that it likes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking me to take him through the basic nature of the Bill. I do not know whether that is a tactic to waste more of the Committee's time. The board of management can change any matter relating to the school, provided that it is not a basic characteristic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman shakes his head. For example, the board of management can change the policy on uniform without a ballot. Uniform is not one of the basic characteristics which are protected. The amendments, which I assume the hon. Gentleman has put forward and supports, would remove from the list of basic characteristics each in turn of the five that are set aside as not being within the province of the board of management to change. The hon. Gentleman asks me where the Bill says that the board of management can change aspects of the running of the school, but that is what the whole Bill is about— giving the board the ability to manage the school. The only reserved matters are the basic characteristics, which the amendments would remove from that protection. That is why my hon. Friends were surprised to see that those amendments had been tabled by Opposition Members. They would result in a position similar to that under the Education Reform Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
I was explaining the procedure that had to be followed to change the characteristics and had got as far as saying that consultation with the education authority was important because the authority was responsible for provision throughout its area, so it was proper that its views should be sought and taken into account. After that a ballot of parents has to be held. That is a unique provision; it has no parallel in the Education Reform Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that the board must publish its proposals in a prescribed manner. That probably means that they will be published in newspapers, displayed in public libraries and so on. Then three months—that period is the result of our deliberations during the night— have to elapse during which any person may make representations on those proposals. Finally, the Secretary of State has to decide whether to accept the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No other school has to go through anything like that process. At an independent school it would simply be up to the managers or owners to decide, although of course they would presumably take their decision in the light of known or estimated parental demand. If it were a local authority school, the local authority would indeed have to consult parents but would otherwise be entirely free to make its own decision, generally speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, the fuss made about the provision seems extraordinary. Perhaps if we had left clause 28 out the Opposition would have been clamouring for us to put something like it into the Bill—although their amendments seem designed to weaken its effect.

I suggest to the Opposition that they withdraw that misguided amendment. I hope that my hon. Friends will resist the temptation to support any of the amendments or to prevent the Opposition from withdrawing the one that has been moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have asked the Minister further questions. It has been a valuable exercise. I said at the outset that the amendments were designed only to probe and provide an opportunity to debate and comment on selection, special needs and other aspects, expecially as they relate to rural communities. I accept the interpretation of the amendments. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ARRANGEMENTS IN RESPECT OF BALLOT OF PARENTS REGARDING CHANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS OF SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 185, in page 57, line 48, leave out "children" and insert "pupils".—	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.]</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 186, in page 58, line 9, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>", and to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained,".— 	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the passage in the amendment were omitted and the Secretary of State's consent no longer necessary, paragraph 5 would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the arrangements shall be such as the board thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
Throughout our proceedings, we have had the impression that the Secretary of State will be the board's super ego, govern its activities and ensure that its more uncontrollable or baser desires about the school's management do not get out of hand. When we asked why the Secretary of State is the looming presence in a Bill that purports to be about parent power, we were told that that is necessary to govern the board of management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman embarks on one of his long speeches about the Secretary of State's role, I must stress that, under paragraph 2 to schedule 7, the arrangements for a ballot must accord with any guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Therefore, his consent to the precise arrangements is superfluous. The amendment is purely technical, which is why it was moved formally. Any anxiety that the hon. Gentleman might have about the Secretary of State's role is met by the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; The Minister has now answered the question why the Secretary of State's power to look over the shoulder of the board of management would be removed from that unique provision, he said that the amendment was technical, because the Secretary of State already has the power under paragraph 2 to ensure that arrangements are made according to his guidance. Paragraph 5 gives rise to a possible conflict between the board's ability to make arrangements such as it thinks fit and paragraph 2, which states that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"arrangements shall accord with such guidance as the Secretary of State may from time to time publish".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, on the one hand, the Secretary of State will lay down guidelines while, on the other, the arrangements for the ballot will be made according to what the board of management "thinks fit". In the case of a conflict, will the Minister say which side of the dispute would win? If the guidelines laid down by the Secretary of State do not suit the board, what power of redress would it have to ask him to reconsider the arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that paragraph 5 will answer my question, as it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Schedule".</p></blockquote>
That means that, subject to the Secretary of State's guidance, the board of management shall make the arrangements that it "thinks fit". Therefore, if the arrangements will ultimately be subject to the Secretary of State's guidance, why does the Bill include the provision referring to the board? The schedule is redundant because it is the Secretary of State who will have the ultimate power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
