	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from column 230]</p>
	<p>12.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was struggling with the question on the statistical correlation raised by the honourable Member for Western Isles. The best that I can do is to refer him to the work on comprehensive education by the Centre for Education Sociology at Edinburgh university. The honourable Member for Fife, Central argued that that research showed that the comprehensive system has been a success. I pointed out that he should not place too much faith in that conclusion because the research included in its description of the comprehensive system the raising of the school leaving age, the increase in teacher numbers and the provision of greater examination opportunities. It concluded that the increase in examination passes showed that the comprehensive system was a success. That conclusion must be studied with care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend the Mint agree that Opposition Members have made an amazing U-turn on the influential issues of the Bill. Last year the case against Paisley grammar put by the honourable Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) was that its exam results were poor compared with Eastwood high school and Mearns Castle, despite the fact that Paisley grammar has a broad catchment area of all social classes. His argument was statistically flawed. Eastwood high and Mearns Castle are schools in my constituency whose catchment areas include the wealthiest sections of the community in Strathclyde outside Bearsden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is right. One of the reasons why the Opposition showed discomfort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anger, not discomfort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The anger is felt by the Government, but it is translated into positive policies to resolve the problem. My honourable Friend is right to state that the academic results were used by the honourable Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) to undermine Paisley grammar. The parents who chose to send their children to Paisley grammar, even if they were not aware of the statistical justification, obviously knew of the quality of education provided and used the parents' charter to benefit from it. It is a mystery why one of the most successful schools should have been targeted for closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
I shall finish the point that I was making on the comprehensive system. The main conclusion of that research was that the success of the comprehensive system was shown by the reduction of roughly half an O-grade award in the gap between pupils from middle-class backgrounds and those from working-class backgrounds. In absolute terms, the gap remains large, at the equivalent of three to four O-grades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Western Isles asked me to confirm that there is a statistical correlation. I am happy to agree that there is a difference in performance between children of these backgrounds, which is the equivalent of three to four O-grades of attainment. But we expect the Opposition to have a different approach to that problem. We believe in equality of opportunity, but the Opposition do not— [Laughter.] The honourable Member for Fife, Central laughs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only reasonable response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall remind the honourable Gentleman of what my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading. He said that on 31 July 1983 the right honourable Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) said on "Newsnight":
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not the party of equality of opportunity. That is a view of society of the conservative party."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c. 638.]</p></blockquote>
The right honourable Gentleman said that the Labour party was the party of equality of opportunity, but the Labour party is the party of equality of outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paisley grammar offended so many people because it produced a different outcome from other schools and was highly successful. It was unfairly dismissed as a snob school, as inappropriate, and as a school for middle-class children, because it did not conform to equality of outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which of the honourable Members assembled here made those comments about Paisley grammar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who has become the champion of Paisley grammar, will endeavour to give the honourable Gentleman a list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee on this matter, but I wish briefly to refer to selection in response to the honourable Member for Fife, Central, because I am most puzzled. I understood that Opposition Members considered that there was no demand for selection in Scotland, and did not believe that any school would become self-governing. That view seemed to change and they told Scotland that the proposals were a great threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the honourable Member for Fife, Central was pressed by my honourable Friend for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) to say whether he thought any schools would become self-governing,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
the honourable Gentleman refused to answer three times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will accept that the last thing that we would want to do is to respond to a Bill that we despise. Why does not the Minister tell us what academic selection has to do with equal access? If the Minister dealt with such points, it would help us better to understand the thinking behind this piece of education reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone will have noticed that once again the honourable Gentleman has refused to answer the question. Is the answer none, or some, or does the honourable Gentleman believe that no schools will become self-governing? If so, why is he so intent on arguing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the point of this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman will listen to the argument, he will see the point. The point is that when schools become self-governing, they will maintain the same status and characteristics. The honourable Gentleman and other Opposition Members have spent the greater part of the day arguing that the proposals represent a great threat to the Scottish education system and will mean the reintroduction of selection. That must mean that they think that many schools will become self-governing and that many parents will vote in ballots for selection. That is a tremendous condemnation of the education system as they see it. I do not subscribe to that view. But Opposition Members should put their arguments in context and speak about the effect of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the honourable Gentleman. It is for the honourable Member for Fife, Central, who is the Opposition spokesman on the Bill, to tell us his position. I shall give way to him again. It will be the fifth occasion on which he has been asked that question, and I hope that he will answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for asking me to state my position on opted-out schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take very seriously any threat to Scottish education; a hypothetical question will not receive a response. Will the Minister tell us why academic selection will improve equal access in Scottish education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already explained, it will not be for Ministers, but for parents, to put forward proposals in respect of selection or anything else. The Bill does not allow for proposals for selection in the initial stages of a school that opts to be self-governing. My right honourable learned Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear that he will not consider proposals involving selection in the first few years. No proposal for selection will come to Ministers unless it has been put forward by the board of management and has the endorsement of the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman says, "Will it?". He is refusing to tell the Committee whether he believes that any schools should become self-governing, yet he expects me to say whether I think that some schools might be selective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made progress and established that the honourable Gentleman believes that it is perfectly all right to have selection for children gifted in music or dance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; provision should be made for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be falling back on the previous position. I thought that Opposition Members were arguing that it was OK for Knightswood to select children according to their ability in dance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my honourable Friend delve into the difference between provision and selection? The honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said that there would be provision for music and dance. What does he mean by that? Will everyone who wants to go to a particular school gain automatic entry? The truth is that there must be some sort of selection and that provision equals selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The truth is that Opposition Members are so terrified of the word "selection" that they dare not even endorse what is happening at present in a comprehensive school in Strathclyde. Talented children wanting to get into the school of dance have to compete for places and are selected according to their ability and commitment to dance. That is something that the vast majority of people would endorse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another type of selection in our schools, which has nothing to do with dance or music. It deliberately provides specialist facilities and teaching for children with special needs. That is also a form of selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not on academic criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman says that that is not based on academic criteria. Those children are selected because they have particular difficulties and require special support with their academic work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is different from academic criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the honourable Gentleman so that he can explain how that differs from having academic criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made great play of clause 16(4), which refers to ability and aptitude. We have said that there is a case, in terms of economies of scale and cultural activities, in respect of dance, drama and music. There is a definite distinction, not only academically, but in the perception of Scottish people, between that and selection on academic ability. The Minister can wriggle all he wants. Will he give

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>235</span>
us a guarantee that academic selection will not be the basis upon which opted-out schools change their characteristics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the honourable Gentleman a guarantee that the provisions in the Bill as drafted will allow for flexibility to take account of the particular circumstances in schools and the wishes of parents. Fortunately, it is not within our power to draft legislation to take account of the rather weird and wonderful distinctions which the honourable Gentleman makes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that they could do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman will have an opportunity later to table amendments, which we shall no doubt discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman told us that music and dance were all right. The honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) got into difficulty over Gaelic and now we are talking about special provision for children, perhaps with reading and learning difficulties and special units of that kind, which will select the children. We are told that that is not selection on an academic basis. It is selection of children for a particular provision. It would be acceptable for a self-governing school to make such provision for children from a wide area. In some areas, local authorities and parents already look to the independent sector or grant-aided schools for appropriate special needs provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone accepts that special needs provision can be the way to deal with the children who require specialist attention and facilities. There is no reason why a self-governing school should not make such provision a speciality, and it need not deprive children from its locality of mainstream education provision in doing so. Specialist units, of whatever sort, are likely to form only a minor part of any such school. If such a unit is entirely appropriate. I return to my question. Why are Opposition Members so opposed to units that might choose to foster excellence in other subjects, whether classics, specialist languages or whatever? There is no answer because it has much more to do with dogma and Labour party conferences than the needs of education. The provisions in these amendments would bring a rigidity into the system which would make it unable to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) told us the story of Eigg and land nationalisation. He said that he went to see the Secretary of State and suggested that the Scottish Office should buy Eigg because of the particular problems on the island, but that did not mean that he was in favour of land nationalisation. He told us that story to explain Councilor Mason's view as the leader of the Liberals on Strathclyde regional council, a point raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Just for the record, I have the letter that Councillor Mason sent me. I am sorry that the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lo-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
chaber is not here. In that letter, dated 4 July, Councillor Mason wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing to ask you to do everything you can to secure the continuation of Our Lady & St Francis School. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his decisions on Notre Dame and Paisley Grammar, but the case for Our Lady & St Francis is no less strong on educational and social grounds and it would be must unjust if this school were lost only because it may not be quite up to the 80 per cent, occupancy mark.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I understand from my conversation with John MacKay and from the story in yesterday's 	<i>Sunday Times</i> that the Government feels that a Jordanhill solution may not be possible because the premises are presently owned partly by the Order and partly by the Region. Obviously this presents a difficulty, but I hope that you will not regard it as an insuperable obstacle."</p></blockquote>
That is a clear endorsement of our policy on Paisley grammar and a clear sign that Councillor Mason wishes us to continue on our present course. Whether that is analogous to the position on Eigg, I do not know, but if it were, I am tempted to point out that all the Opposition parties voted against the regulations that allowed Paisley grammar and Notre Dame to be saved. Now the Liberals in this Parliament are speaking out against the measure put forward by their own councillor. That may explain why the Liberal party is in its present state. No doubt the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber will reflect on those words and compare them with his account of the reasons for Dr. Mason's view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to McLaren high, which is in the Minister's constituency, and to special needs. The Minister says that he has considered the arguments that special needs will not have their rightful significance in opted-out schools. That aspect worries us and I hope that the Minister will comment further on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman is saying that special needs are not being protected, I cannot agree with him. The Bill includes provisions for special needs among the school's characteristics and is aimed precisely to give protection to such provision. The board of management of a school that has become self-governing must continue to provide for pupils with the range of special needs accommodated by the school before its change of status. Furthermore, the board has a duty to provide suitable education for all pupils, having regard to their age, ability and aptitudes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) referred to the financial burdens on a self-governing school providing for special needs and the resulting pressure on the board of management to restrict or withdraw provision. The Bill does not allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Explain that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The board of management has a duty to provide suitable education for all pupils, having regard to their age, ability and aptitude. On the financial side, our commitment is to ensure that a self-governing school is no worse off, or no better off, than if it were still in the control of the education authority. That means that where a school makes particular provision for special needs pupils, that will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
be recognised in assessing the level of recurrent grants to the school. Many such children require additional staffing and equipment, as the honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has pointed out; McLaren is an example of where that has been done. Special needs pupils are more expensive to educate and that factor will be taken into account. In those circumstances, a school would have no financial incentive to divest itself of provision already in place for speial needs pupils. Furthermore, the education authority has a continuing and direct role to play in special needs provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 4 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 the regional psychological service has a duty to all children living in its area, irrespective of the school that they attend. Children in a self-governing school who require its help will be able to make use of it. The change of the school's status will not cut pupils off from the assistance of educational psychologists. If a child has recorded special needs, the education authority has a continuing involvement in assessment and placing decisions. Often, in the case of such children, decisions about significant expenditure to provide specialist facilities at their local school will have to be made. Such decisions involve authorities in making major structural alterations to a school, or purchasing expensive equipment, for the benefit of a small number of children, so that they can be educated alongside other children from their community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the most appropriate school for a child is self-governing, the education authority, in discharging its duty to provide for children with special needs, would have to consider whether to put the necessary additional resources into that school or to oblige the child to travel to a second education authority school. If the resources are to be spent in any case, it would be unreasonable for an authority to refuse to make provision for children with special needs, simply because a school was self-governing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not ease our concern because the Scottish Office gives the self-governing schools the grants that would normally be given by the education authority. So the Government are asking the education authority to give extra money from its budget, because that money has already gone to the self-governing school. Such issues go to the core of the debate on finance, and that is why we are not satisfied with the Minister's answer. The Minister must examine this serious problem. There is unanimity on this side of the Committee and in Scotland on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend that I can satisfy the honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) in every respect, but I have done my best during this extended period in Committee.

	<p>	<b>On accordingly negatived.</b></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is a problem regarding finance, as the Bill provides for special purpose grants to be made if necessary. I have already explained the position in respect of the education authority's duty towards recorded children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray made an extremely good point when she asked how we could place a stronger duty on the board of management to clarify the position. We could consider whether the board of management could be given a positive duty to encourage and develop provision for children with special educational needs, having regards to the needs of the area. We could make a technical amendment to clause 28 and clause 16(4)(b), putting beyond doubt the fact that the provision of special needs would be increased within a school by decision of the board of management, but could not be reduced other than through the full proceedings of clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be times when certain forms of special provision are no longer appropriate. Educational thinking develops in that area, as in others, and schools should not be obliged to retain outmoded provisions. The very rigidities and difficulties contained in Clause 28 to alter the character of schools could prevent schools from expanding their facilities for children with special needs. Therefore, I take the point made by the honourable member for Moray about emphasising the duty of the board of management. Ironically, Labour Members' complaints that clause 28 is not sufficiently tough and could create problems for the special needs provision, because it is too tough. I shall return to the matter with some suggestion later in the Committee stage of possibly on Report.

This probing amendment seeks to discover the meaning of the phrase in clause 2(4)(b)
	<br><blockquote><p>"in so far as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
It is interesting to consider clause 18(l)(b) in this

context because we are discussing modifications and consultation with the school board about the rejection or approval of proposals submitted. We want the Minister to explain why that phrase is included in clause 2(4)(b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the intention of the amendment is. It attempts to bring precisely into line proposals drafted by a school board and the formal order made by the Secretary of State providing for the initial scheme of government of a school. The scheme of government should reflect the intention set out in the agreed proposals for self-governing status and clause 2(4)(b) has been drafted to ensure that. The Secretary of State is not at liberty to depart from agreed proposals as he thinks fit. A scheme of government would be open to challenge on the grounds that it could practicably have given more precise effect to the agreed proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is adequate opportunity for the Secretary of State to explore detailed aspects of the proposals with the school board before giving his approval. If, in the light of representations on the published proposals or on other grounds, he cannot accept some aspect of the board's ideas, clause (18(l)(b) allows him to modify the original proposals in consultation with the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee accepted the amendment, it would oblige the Secretary of State to modify the detailed wording of a board's proposals before he approved them so that they could be written directly into a formal scheme of government. Alternatively, a school board itself would be obliged to seek professional legal advice on the preparation of its proposals in suitable form. Neither outcome is desirable. The proposals should be the work of the school board seeking self-governing status, leaving it to the Secretary of State to translate the agreed intentions into language appropriate to a scheme of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the honourable Member for Fife, Central withdrew the amendment because it would not provide an improved process or benefit parents. On the contrary, it would put a considerable burden and cost on parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a more than generous response to our probing amendment, which merely questions the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"in so far as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
Clause 18(l)(b) allows the Secretary of State to modify
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation … with such modifications as he thinks desirable".</p></blockquote>
I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance on the extra insertion of that, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
bate on the issue raised by the amendments and on clause 28 stand part. Clause 28 is a major clause, and we are not taking a decision on whether it should stand part; we shall submit amendments later, as the Minister and other honourable Members have suggested. The Minister has highlighted the paradox whereby we were asking for the virtual deletion of clause 28. but at the same time want to propose certain characteristics and safeguards. I assure the Committee that we shall do that later, by tabling amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the start of the debate we put a set of challenges to the Minister. I am not convinced that he has fared well in responding positively to the concerns that we raised. He gave us assurances on the special needs provisions—I will give him that. It is a sensitive and emotive subject and, as he rightly pointed out. there are broad areas of special needs from recorded special needs through to children with learning difficulties in school. We await with interest the Minister's returning later, either in Committee or on Report, with something that we hope will satisfy the many worries about the ability of an opted-out school, which has decided on its initial characteristics and had them approved, to have the characteristics set out in clause 16(4) amended through clause 28. I think that the Minister appreciates that one of our difficulties today has been that we have had to refer to clause 16(4) without being able to table amendments and discuss the measure in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific changes envisaged should be watertight. Clause 16(4)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"stating what provision, if any, the school makes for children with special educational needs".</p></blockquote>
We do not argue against the Government's statement that they will provide for schools with special needs, as they—with the local authorities—do now. Some of the provision for special needs education in Scotland is excellent, and I do not take that away from the Government or the education authorities. But there is a continuing concern about what will happen when a school has opted out. We could have a knockabout debate on questions of trust, philosophy and politics. I have never been involved with special needs teaching as some honourable Members have, but I know from my experience of local government that for children and parents involved in special needs education these are harrowing times. We need assurances that the present good provision will continue. Opted-out schools must never be in a position to relinquish their responsibilities to such children for any reason. We shall suspend judgment on special needs until we have seen what the Minister comes up with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disappointment for us is the Government's failure to provide any reassurances on academic selection and the transfer of children from primary schools to secondary schools. I often laugh and smirk when the Minister is on his feet and I understand that frustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One benefit of comprehensivisation has been the non-selection of pupils at the age of 11 when they transfer to the secondary sector. We shall campaign vigorously to maintain that and the Minister should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
consider the issue. The Minister has tried, unsuccessfully, to make a fine distinction between the need for specialisation in areas of culture, such as dance and drama, and the general academic criteria on which transfer is based. No one would argue against the need for schools providing drama and dance to cover a wide catchment area and area of ability, but the Opposition do not see a fine distinction between that and general academic criteria. We believe that if a school opts under clause 2, and based on clause 16(4) and with the help of clause 28, it would be a major threat to the comprehensive system. Academic selection hits at the heart of that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may differ in our view of the merits of comprehensive and independent schools. It would have been more honest if the Minister had said, "Yes, we support academic selection". Some of my honourable Friends urged him to do that, and if he had done so the debate would have been much easier to follow and the Government's approach would have been more honest than the one that they adopted of referring to the provision of dance and, then, the provision of Gaelic language teaching in schools. We have been bitterly disappointed by the Government's response on selection and there is overwhelming support in Scotland to reject their view. We have urged the Minister to reconsider, but we fear that he will not move on academic selection and, even more worryingly, will not define it for the debate that will ensue in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another test of the clause involves the first choice always being offered to child in what was known as a catchment area, and is now called a delineated area, the boundaries of which are more imprecise than they might have been. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) was assured that rural areas will have special treatment. We support that. Will the same generosity apply to urban areas and the central belt of Scotland? It has been a feature of the system, with the parents' charter and the provision of education authorities, that in more than 95 per cent, of cases a child will be able to attend the school of his or her choice. My honourable Friend the Minister for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) eloquently expressed the view that choice has to be real and effective. Our biggest fear is that if a school opts out or changes its characteristics, children will be deprived of the rights that they have under the parents' charter and as part of the comprehensive provision of education authorities. We have had no assurances on that, so parents and children will suffer if schools opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned denominational schools. Earlier in the debate letters were read out from the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church, saying that they were extremely upset and worried about the speed with which the Bill was going through Parliament. We must urge the Government to listen, consider and consult. The clause is a major element of the Bill. It comes a few months after the Queen's Speech, and groups in Scotland including the Churches, have not been consulted. We know about the phone calls between the Minister and certain groups in Scotland about matters related to denominational schools. I do
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
not object to that—the Minister is responsible for education in Scotland. However, the Churches demand from the Government proper consultation about major changes that may take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that he has issued a consultative document, but in his response will he deal with the letter about which the Committee was told, which expressed the Churches' anxiety about the haste with which the proposals were going through Parliament and the impact that they could have on denominational schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw the letter from the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church, but I have had no request for a meeting with the Church of Scotland to discuss the paper that we issued in December or the Bill. I had a request from the Catholic Church, however. There have been no phone calls between me and the Church. I met the Catholic hierarchy to discuss the Bill and I presented an early draft of some of our proposals so that the Church representatives could be fully consulted. They were extremely appreciative of the consultation, so I was somewhat surprised to find that the Catholic Church was a co-signatory to the document issued by the joint Churches. I shall be happy to respond in any way that I can. The honourable Gentleman is being a little unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that there had been telephone conversations about denominational schools in Scotland. I did not say that there had been telephone conversations with the Catholic Church. When he reflects, the Minister will know that I know that there have been discussions on specific issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he had not received a request for a meeting. Can we take it as read that the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church must ask for a meeting on a major Bill, before the Minister or his advisers will approach them for consultations? Do not the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church have an important place in education in Scotland? Why must they write to the Minister? Should not the Minister consult the organisations involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is making a silly point. I have had three meetings with the Catholic Church and an informal meeting with Archbishop Winning. Some of those meetings were at my request and some were at the request of other people. I could not have meetings with everyone who has an interest in education, or I should do nothing but sit in meetings. Come to think of it, that is what I do. I meet many more people than has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman referred to the point made by my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ferred to correspondence, I assumed that he was referring to parents in Livingston who are worried about denominational provision. Is that the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about telephoen calls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that was the honourable Gentleman's reference, I apologise for misleading him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to pursue the discussion with the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the importance of his time, which I accept. However, it is important to place on record the fact that although meetings with various organisations may be limited at ministerial level, he has time to meet the grant-maintained schools trust, and the city technology college trust, which may have a role to play in technology academies, and he will meet opt-out schools in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Minister set out clearly his position on meetings with the Churches. The honourable Gentleman is making allegations about telephone calls of which I cannot follow the details. Whom are the calls from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is fully aware of what is involved and I shall leave it at that. I should stray too far from clause 2 if I further indulged the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), as I think that you were about to tell me, Mr Hogg. We shall be meeting the Churches over Easter, to talk about denominational schools and clauses 16(4) and 28. We shall identify whether the document to which the Minister referred, and, which the two Churches have signed, was merely a knee-jerk response to something that the Minister has not appreciated. Or have the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church written to every Member of Parliament to suggest that the Bill is being bulldozed through the House? We shall return to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another challenge that we gave the Minister was about children with emotional or behavioural difficulties. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who is an ex-teacher, mentioned that serious problem. Education authorities are in the curious position of being chastised, Glasgow schools have been smeared and Strathclyde has been attacked, but the education authorities will continue to look after, provide for and work with opted-out schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every child has a right to receive all the benefits that he currently receives under the comprehensive system. Any changes to the characteristics of an opted-out school should not even hint that those schools would not face their moral and education responsibilities for children with special difficulties. Those difficulties are not classified as special needs, but can be found in schools in Scotland, England and Wales. I shall not use the phrase that I had intended to use, but opted-out schools must not reject or ex-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
clude children and leave the education authority to pick up the pieces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has failed to give either the Scottish people or a united Opposition assurances on a wide range of issues. At the heart of clause 2 is a major attack on comprehensive education. We have appealed to the Government to come clean. If we were debating the introduction of selective education, we should not have to talk in code. If we were debating a threat to aspects of comprehensivisation, such as provision for children with special needs or emotional difficulties, we could have a proper debate. However, the Government know that the Bill is deeply unpopular in Scotland, so they have laced each provision with "choice" and the promise of improving standards whereas, in reality, the Bill represents a major attack on comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the honourable Member for Eastwood, it is remarkable how many times we have heard specific examples from Glasgow and Strathclyde upon which the structure of the Bill is based. I do not mind that, but intellectually, to generalise from the specific without the Gentleman's political overtones is something that we deplore. Examples should be used, but not as a general basis on which to mount a massive attack on comprehensive education. I urge him and his honourable Friends to visit Scotland and study the provision of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Visit Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should listen. I even told the honourable Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) that it would be a good idea if he visited Scotland. There is much about Scottish education that never emanates from the comments of Conservative Members. Why is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for inviting me to visit Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant Fife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad to visit Fife, and my old school. As the honourable Gentleman knows, I am a product of the Scottish comprehensive education system. Just before the honourable Gentleman referred to me, he said that all children have the right to receive the benefits of comprehensive education in Scotland that they currently receive. Therefore, do I take it that he supports the benefits that are being received by the pupils of the various schools to which I referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I was about to refer to the honourable Member for Eastwood as the Minister, but that would have been unkind. It was a Freudian slip for which I apologise. There is a rich provision of education in Scotland. In some respects, I admire the political prowess of the honourable Gentleman and his links with the Prime Minister and other influential members of the Conservative party. Sadly, however, I must exclude most of the members in the honourable Gentleman's company this evening. But it was appal-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
ling of the honourable Gentleman to build a major attack on comprehensive education on the back of political reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can vouch for the fact that the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) travels to Scotland each week. I recently travelled in the same plane with him and when the Under-Secretary came on board, he bowed to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot make a suitable comment about that intervention anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about equal opportunity. However, "equal worth" is a more important phrase to characterise the provision of education. As my honourable Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) suggested, the basis of the comprehensive education system is to ensure that each child has a quality education. That means that the worth of each child is at the forefront of our thinking, regardless of political differences. That equal worth must relate also to equal access. The main thrust of the clause and the Bill will fundamentally affect that access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of a school from a community has been described as an elaborate procedure. Parents of children in feeder primary schools cannot participate in that decision; it is a choice only for those who opt out. The implications for children who remain within the education authority sector could be profound. That brings us back to the Government's definition of choice, on which we fundamentally disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a sad day for Scottish education—or, rather, two sad days. The Bill is unwelcome, and is being taken through the House with little consultation with the parties concerned or with the important education interests in Scotland. It must be clear to the Minister, and his honourable Friends, that the insult that the Scots feel is offered by the Bill is real; it is not imaginary and we are not bringing forward amendments in isolation to this, or any other, clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that after we have completed our debate on clause 2 the Minister will reconsider. If there is one telling feature of our attacks on it, is that they have brought up the question of the return to the Scottish education system of selection based on academic criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That change will be the basis of the campaign that will take place in Scotland to ensure that our people know that when the Government speak of choice, they mean privilege. For the majority of the 800,000 Scottish schoolchildren, opting-out will mean little, if it takes place. However, we will ensure that the Scots know that the Government, once again, have betrayed them on every education issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the debates on Thursday and today, many arguments have been put, and on this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
clause stand part debate we should pick up some of the questions that the Minister failed to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members compared English comprehensives with those in Scotland. They can be forgiven for not knowing the detailed differences between them but that ignorance is unforgivable among Scottish Conservative Members. We have heard of the different social mixes to be found in, say, an inner city area of London, and in the peripheral areas of Glasgow. In Glasgow, the major problems are in the peripheral areas, not the inner city. I once read that 80 languages are spoken in the London area, so its schools have problems that do not exist in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the performances in the two countries are compared, one has to remember that Scottish secondary school teachers have different qualifications from those in England. In the Scottish system, a teacher has to have a degree in the subject that he or she teaches, and a sufficient number of passes in the subject; a teaching qualification is needed in addition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Lady is making an interesting speech, but it is not related to clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I accept your ruling, Mr. Hogg, but I was replying to a point made by Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady can make a speech dealing with clause 2 stand part, but it is not incumbent upon her to reply to any debates. She should make her own speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Hogg, but I will find some other occasion on which to put my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when a family decides to vote to opt out? As was said earlier, within one family, one child might qualify for as school with opting-out arrangements, while other members of the family do not. The opted-out school might decide on some way to distinguish itself from neighbourhood schools—such as a rigorously imposed uniform, possibly an expensive one. Some members of the family will need that while others will not. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I cannot hear what honourable Members are saying, but if they wish to intervene, they can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one member of the family attended that school, with its uniform and other required equipment, but another member of the family did not, we can see conflicts arising within the family. Some children may complain about the privileges that are being accorded to their brothers and sisters. It is difficult enough to raise a family in modern times without creating unnecessary clothes, equipment, extra privileges at school and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that all the children are eligible for the school that will opt out, but the parents can afford the financial back-up for only one, because of the costs of the uniform, school trips abroad, extracurricular activities, and so on. The honourable Mem-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
ber for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) shakes his head. Is he saying that that would not happen in schools which opt out? He is refusing to reply, so I assume that that can happen. The parents must decide which child will receive the benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even today, some families would decide that the boys must come first on the ground that the girls will marry anyway. That is an important point when considering equality of the sexes. The parents may decide that the eldest should have the benefits, or it could be a haphazard decision and a matter of whichever child attained entry age to the school when the family were in reasonably prosperous circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why recreate those difficulties for families? Why not retain our comprehensive school system which is designed to cater for all children, regardless of sex, their ability, or the ability of the parents to push for the advantage of their children at the expense of others?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not suggesting that there are never any problems in the comprehensive system. But the answer to those problems is not to provide an opting out system. What good will opting out do for the parents of Possilpark pupils? That question has not been answered and we wait in vain for it. We are discussing resources that have been denied to schools such as Possilpark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary argued earlier that the Secretary of State would not impose change and that that could be initiated only at local level, which the Secretary of State would or would not approve. We can see clearly that parents would soon learn what the Secretary of State would approve and what he would not. We were assured that the Secretary of State would not approve something that was unreasonable, but we have still to know the definition of "reasonable". The Bill does not spell that out, so we must rely on the Secretary of State, although he could not personally examine every case, except perhaps Paisley grammar. That decision will be taken by a civil servant who will presumably act on advice. If there is to be ministerial advice, we should be able to examine it now and not leave it to some future consideration.

The greatest absurdity in Conservative Members' arguments on clause 2 was their denial that social class

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That demonstrates the complete ignorance of Conservative Members. The shelves of colleges of education throughout the world are groaning with books on the nature and nurture arguments in education. Arguments have been bandied about for generations on what creates abilities and achievements in education. Right-wing educational sociologists and psychologists attempted to argue that, on average, working class people were innately less able than middle-class people. They deliberately skewed the figures to try to prove that, but it was disproved several years ago.

If children are born into a house that is filled with books, and have parents with a high standard of education, they are more advantaged than those who does not have such a start. If parents have a reasonable standard of living, their children have a better chance than the children whose parents do not. If children go to school with a decent breakfast in their stomachs and decent shoes on their feet, they have a better chance than those who do not. I do not understand why Conservative Members are finding this funny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many working-class children in Glasgow schools have far too much reasonability for their tender years, because of family problems with which they must cope. A 10-year old child, for example, might have to care for much younger children and come home to household chores because of sickness or other family problems. Middle-class children often do not have to cope with that while they struggle to get their O-grades and Highers. There is nothing remotely funny about that.

If Conservative Members saw the children in schools such as Possilpark school, it would take the stupid smiles off their faces. In Possilpark there is particularly high unemployment, relatively low skills among parents, and glue sniffing is rife. It is no wonder that the educational achievement of children there is not what we want it to be. There should be proper resources for such schools to help children overcome their disadvantages. Who does the Minister blame for the low attainment in Possilpark? He has yet to tell us whether the blame lies with the teachers, the parents or the long history of lack of care for children, particularly over the past 10 years when the Conservatives have failed to provide the necessary resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

All the Government's arguments about music and dance were quite irrelevant. My honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has argued about the distinction between music and dance and special educational needs and selection on the grounds of general academic ability. I see no problem about making special provision for exceptionally talented youngsters in music and dance; it would not be efficient to try to provide for them in any other way.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman wants to use such a device because the Government have evaded the central argument behind the Bill. The Opposition object to the clause because of the risk to schools from selection on the basis of academic ability. That is at the core of the clause and the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central thrust of the Bill is a drive towards selection on the basis of general academic ability. The Minister may argue that we should not restrict the articles of management of schools to rule out the possibility of selection on the basis of academic ability, because we need to allow exceptions, such as special provision for music and dance. However, that would not prevent him from amending the Bill to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
prohibit the articles of management of a self-governing school from excluding pupils on the grounds of general academic ability. Such an amendment would fit the Minister's pronounced desire to allow flexibility and leeway for special provisions and would make it clear to the people of Scotland that the Bill will not turn the clock back to the days of selection on general academic ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no problem to devise such a provision and include it in the Bill. If the Minister does not do so, the public can only conclude that he wishes a return to the days of special schools that select their pupils not for any special ability such as music and dance but on general academic ability. Our objection to the clause and the articles of management is that they do not rule out the prospect of selection. What the Minister said and what the Secretary of State failed to say encourages the prospect of turning back the clock to the days of selection on general academic ability. That would be a sad day for Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has asked for estimates of the number of schools that will take advantage of the opting-out provision. In my view, if the Minister included a provision that would make it impossible for schools to select pupils on the grounds of general academic ability, there would be no demand for such a Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier in the Committee's proceedings the Minister accused Opposition Members of being conservatives because we supported the status quo. Sometimes the status quo is worth supporting. Indeed, in 1939, many people were prepared to lay down their lives to defend the status quo against the radical changes proposed by Mr. Adolf Hitler. I suppose that the Minister, too, would have been prepared to defend the status quo had he been around in 1939. Clause 2 introduces a radical new concept into Scottish education and it is worth standing up for the status quo and saying that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware, Mr. Hogg, that you are keen that honourable Members should keep to the point. I am anxious to do that, but during our long debate I could not help reflecting that the poll tax is the only tax that dare not speak its name. It calls itself the community charge. In a sense, clause 2 is the same, in that it dare not speak its own name. It refers to self-governing schools but in reality we are discussing the reintroduc-tion of academic selection. That is what self-governing schools are about. But the Minister and his honourable Friends cannot say openly to the Committee or to the Scottish people that the Government want to reintroduce academic selection into Scottish education. They go all round the houses with this new concept of self-governing schools that will have their own schemes of government and articles of manage-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
ment and constitution, yet the reality behind that framework is the reintroduction of academic selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue has been discussed comprehensively and various interpretations have emerged of what the scheme of government meant and whether it would include the idea of academic selection. The Under-Secretary of State said that academic selection would be confined to dance and music. The Secretary of State for Scotland then chipped in and suggested that perhaps Gaelic language would also be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assorted Toms, Dicks and Harrys on the Back Benches—perhaps "Dicks" may be the most appropriate—suggested that physics, mats and engineering could be the subjects open for academic selection. Later, the Minister threw in classics and specialist languages as subjects on which pupils should qualify academically before they could study at a particular school. By whatever criteria the Minister tries to describe that concept—he used the phrase "some specialism" and the more general term "academic selection" has also been used—the reality is that the clause is reintroducing into Scottish education the concept of academic selection for entry into schools. It is under a new guise but is, in essence, the old form of academic selection, which we all thought that we had seen the back of many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that rural schools will continue to exist and that parents will retain the right to send their children to them under the parents' charter. He said that the parents' charter would cover all self-governing schools and would operate in the same way as elsewhere. That struck me as disingenuous, because the parents' charter imposes a duty on the boards of management of self-governing schools with their own schemes of government to admit children who seek admission to those schools. However, that duty does not apply if the education normally provided at the school is not suited to the age, ability or aptitude of the child. Therefore, an opted-out school could have an admissions policy that defines acces to the school in terms of academic ability and could refuse parents' requests to have their children placed in that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that that would not happen in rural areas, but he did not say that it would not happen in other areas. We can only conclude that the object of the Bill is to reintroduce academic selection to schools in Scotland's towns and cities, and to operate it in defiance of the parents' charter. The Minister is staring vacantly at the ceiling and not responding to my comments, so I must assume that he agrees with my interpretation of his argument. That is very upsetting, because he had said that parents could appeal against school's refusal to admit their child on the grounds of not being sufficiently academically able.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, parents can have a decision referred to an appeals committee, which will be set up by the board of management and will include elected and non-elected members of the board of management and people who are not members of the board of management. Such an appeals committee, operating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
within the structure of a board of management in an opted-out school that has already decided to reintroduce academic selection, is unlikely to find in favour of parents who have appealed against a decision to reject their children on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will undoubtedly point out that an appeal can be made to the sheriff court, but even there, the Bill defines how the sheriff can decide on that appeal. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sheriff may on an appeal under this paragraph confirm the hoard's decision if he is satisfied … that one or more of the grounds of refusal specified in paragraph 2(2) of this Schedule exists or exist".</p></blockquote>
The grounds for refusal specified in paragraph 2(2) of the schedule include the child not being able enough to meet the admission criteria specified for that school within its scheme of government. So the sheriff must find in favour of keeping the child out of the school
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has gone quiet because he cannot argue against the fact that that is the essence of the clause. If the clause is implemented and schemes of government arc drawn up for self-government schools, thousands or even hundreds of thousands— depending on how many schools opt out in the long run—of children will be barred from entering the school of their choice, simply because they are not considered able enough to cope with the subjects that are given special emphasis within that school. That is unfortunate. The Minister will not admit to it either in or outwith the Committee and will do everything in his power to make the real purpose of the clause as obscure as possible by discussing other notions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has developed a number of arguments during the debates on the clause. He said that the idea of self-governing schools was to create the opportunity for schools that would promote specialist education. I understand what he was getting at; I think that he was referring to special units for dance, music, drama and so on. He went on to say that there would also be an opportunity for schools to provide the type of education that parents want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debates on clause 2 and other clauses show exactly how the Government and their supporters define the sort of school that parents want. It might concentrate on a narrow band of subjects such as physics, maths, engineering, and English; it might decide that its pupils would not sit the normal public examinations under the Scottish Certificate of Education and instead sit examinations in GCSE A-levels or whatever; or it might decide on admission by selection, that it should be single sex or denominational and have a stricter discipline and school uniform. Those are all the things that Conservative Members hanker after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government defend that by saying that the Bill will lead to equality of opportunity, but it is opportunity only for parents and children who step outside the mainline comprehensive education system provided by education authorities. Conservative Members have never been able to answer the argument that they are extending equality of opportunity not to everyone but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
to a narrow range of people. The examples that they have produced prove that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of the long traditions in Scottish education and the sort of school that I have just described. He mentioned Dundee high school and said that that private school was accessible to all until we had a Labour Government. I know that the Minister does not like to speak about schools in other honourable Members' constituencies. Obviously he does not know a great deal about Dundee high school because if he asked any Dundonian how he would define Dundee high school the last thing that he would say was that it was accessible to all he citizens of Dundee and their families. Ever since its inception 750 years ago, Dundee high school has, by definition, been about preventing access to it by all but a very narrow range of parents and children in the locality. That is the sort of school that the Minister likes and that he hopes will emerge from the Bill and from the clause in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made the same point about Paisley grammar school. I do not know a great deal about its background, but I understand that the objection to it had nothing to do with the sort of education provided there and whether it was popular; the objection was that it had a high proportion of pupils from outwith its catchment area and the impact of that on the other schools was to distort the education available in the surrounding area. That is what Strathclyde region was upset about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That example reveals the essential element of Conservative Members' argument. They want freedom for some parents to choose the school which will suit their children, irrespective of the impact that that might have on the majority of parents and children who would be adversely affected by it. They do not want freedom for parents to choose; they want freedom for some parents to choose. Even the words that they use—such as "diversity"—show that to be true. Diversity means that school provision is available only for some because if it was available for everybody it would not be diverse; everyone would get the same. If they want diversity, there must be different forms of provision for different groups and small groups must be able to opt out of the mainstream provision and receive a different form of education from everyone else. That is the Government want, and that is what they are arguing for—and that means that they are arguing for licence for some rather than for freedom for all. That is one of the main reasons why we object to clause 2 and the self-governing schools that it would create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill last April, the Under-Secretary of State spoke about magnet schools. He said that they came into being
	<br><blockquote><p>"because of the type of education that they offered. They may offer single-sex education or a quality of academic achievement or the opportunity for overlap curricular activities such as music, and so on."</p></blockquote>
The key words are "quality of academic achievement"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
because the Minister wants opted-out schools to provide better opportunities to pupils than schools under education authority control. The Minister does not want to raise standards to the same level; he wants to maintain two different levels so that one school has a higher standard of achievement than the schools surrounding it. That is the essence of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have used examples of schools that cater for a minority, because those schools have an edge over the majority of schools, parents and children. That is why the Minister and his honourable Friends find them attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said one worthwhile thing on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our concern, in extending and preserving choice should be with the vast majority of parents within the state system."— 	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 28 April 1988; c. 147.]</p></blockquote>
This Bill does nothing for the vast majority of parents and children in the state system. The Bill weakens the state system by attracting parents into opted-out schools that compete with state schools. If the Minister was serious about parents within the state system being his main priority, this legislation would b different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most members of the Committee have received correspondence about the Bill. I was impressed by the arguments of Boroughmuir school council. The council pleaded with members of the Committee to pay attention to its concerns and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All children should continue to enjoy equal opportunities within the maintained education system."</p></blockquote>
By definition, the Bill destroys equality of opportunity for all children within the maintained system, because it creates privilege for a small minority who will move into opted-out schools. Boroughmuir school council continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The comprehensive nature of education in all Scottish schools in the maintained sector should be preserved and not altered by this legislation."</p></blockquote>
The legislation does precisely that. It alters dramatically the comprehensive nature of education in all Scottish schools. The Bill will send Scottish education backwards, not forwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Boroughmuir school council also wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local children should continue to enjoy the same preferential right of access to the local maintained school as at present, regardless of whether it is self-governing or under local authority control."</p></blockquote>
All the argumens surrounding the clause have been about that. Children will not enjoy the same rights of access to the local school, whether it is self-governing or maintained, because from now on schools can set up barriers to local children ever getting through the school gates. The entrance criteria of those schools will be based on academic ability, which is deeply offensive to Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not pretend, as the Minister claimed wc did, that our education system is without fault. We do not deny that there is evidence of poor performance in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
Scottish schools, but we want to find a solution to that problem. We do not allocate blame unfairly, as the Minister does. By comparing two schools in Bearsden and Possilpark, the Minister displayed a lack of sensitivity to the serious points raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). No one would dream of saying that one's class background determined one's ability, but one's environment determines the way in which one's ability can be developed. Children's performance at school must be affected if they do not have their own room or books at home, do not get to bed until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning or do not have breakfast. Those factors are reflected in academic results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently spoke to teachers at a school in one of the worst parts of Dundee. They were very concerned about how the Bill would deal with teacher performance. They wanted to know whether their performance would be judged by the school's academic record. That school could not have a good academic record in the present circumstances because of the area. The Minister would say that it was a poor school, but nothing could be further from the truth. It has less trouble than any other school in Dundee because it tries to provide the education and environment appropriate to its pupils. The pupils like attending the school and the teachers like teaching them. Everyone gets something out of it. The pupils might not do as well in exams as pupils in other schools, but that is determined by factors beyond the school's control. If the Minister is serious about improving performance in Scottish schools, he should tackle those factors, such as unemployment, poverty and bad housing. Instead, he sits back and encourages unemployment, poverty and bad housing and seeks to blame teachers and Opposition Members.

This is a bad Bill and a bad clause. The only people who will vote for it are those whose political career depends on it—Conservative Back Benchers who do not understand it and Conservative Front Benchers whose ministerial position depends on it.

They blame teachers for society's ills, so they intend to differentiate between different types of education provision in Scotland. I want a meeting of minds between ourselves and the Minister. It is sad that the Minister laughs. There will be no meeting of minds because the Minister will not meet us half way. He did not go half way to meet the parents or the teachers' unions. That is the problem with the Bill. There has been no consultation, so it is based on ignorance of the system. If the Minister had any feeling for the system we should not be here at 2.30 in the morning debating such proposals.

education in Scotland. The Minister said that he has faith in the parents and the majority vote, but he must take account of the interests of the children. Let us suppose that a primary school in the Highlands, in the constituency of my honourable Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), decided to teach in Gaelic so that anyone who did not speak it could not attend. What would happen when the children moved on to the Nicolson Institute, where English is the common language? What advice would the Minister give the education authority in such circumstances? That is an example of parents, some of whom might be unrepresentative, taking the opportunity to vote for what they believe will be in their interests when it is not in the wider interests of the education community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made great play of equality of opportunity. That phrase slips off his lips, but it has no meaning. The Government feel that if they make full-time education available for children aged from five to 16, that represents equality of opportunity. We do not agree.

Strathclyde regional council, which has been abused with derogatory remarks and sneers, has tried over the years to have a positive discrimination policy in areas of social deprivation. It is a hard-won policy, but it was implemented because of the social factors in education.

The Minister compared Bearsden and Possilpark. Not much comparison can be made between them. It does not take a genius to know that examination results in Bearsden will be different from those in Possil. I have taught in schools in Bearsden and Possil and I did not work any less hard in Possil than in Bearsden. My work had more tangible results in Bearsden, in terms of examination results. But in terms of the quality of the education environment in which I was working, factors other than examination results had to be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
