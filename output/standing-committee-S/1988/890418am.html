	<div class='clause'>Clause 16</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROPOSALS FOR ACQUISITION OF SELF-GOVERNING STATUS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 8, line 36, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) to consult such persons as may be prescribed by regulations about the published proposals:".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 164, in page 8, line 43, at end insert "and—
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) to consult such persons as may be prescribed by regulations about the published proposals".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments are straightforward and easily understood. They aim to extend the procedures for consulting the local community about the proposals for school self-government. Other individuals besides parents, or other bodies may have a stake in the future management of the school. They include members of the community who use the school or its facilities outside school hours. Although those individuals or bodies may make representations to the Secretary of State, our amendments would require school boards to initiate consultations with parents and other individuals or bodies affected by the proposed changes. Public meetings, for example, would allow people to air their views, debate them with each other and thereby see the force of each other's arguments. Such consultations, important for any school, are especially important in relatively isolated areas where the school's role as a focus of community life goes far beyond its basis task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are highly reasonable and a natural follow-on to the concessions that were made last Thursday night. We assume that the Government will accept the principle behind them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said about the remarks that were made in our previous sitting, about the ability of school boards to consult the feeder primaries. The Opposition now present that as a great new discovery. It is interesting that it did not dawn on them earlier in the Bill's passage
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
through the House that school boards provide an excellent opportunity for the extension of consultation on a variety of matters in the community. I noticed with interest today Strathclyde regional council's conversion to the importance of consultation and involvement— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I should be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) so that he can express his views on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are impractical. They would require school boards to consult other persons and organisations after proposals had passed to the Secretary of State for decision. What would the school boards do with any representations arising from the consultations. They could not respond as the proposals would have passed out of their hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that school boards should consult everybody? Should they consult proponents of Right-wing views, such as the view that schools and colleges should have much greater control over their own affairs, especially their budgets? I am quoting Mr. Charles Gray, although I am not sure who he is—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I understand that he is a senior figure in the Labour party, yet he appears to espouse ideas similar to those of my hon. Friend the Minister. Could it be conversion on the road to Damascus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend tempts me, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a fool of himself in the previous debate on the Church of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that Convervative Members made fools of themselves when discussing the Church of Scotland. But someone who describes religious education as witchcraft is surely not in a position to claim that others have made fools of themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read Mr. Charles Gray's comments, and Conservative Members must be fair. Yesterday I issued a statement welcoming Strathclyde's new-found enthusiasm for our proposals. In fairness to Mr. Gray, he said that Strathclyde council had been planning to take such action for five years, and that it had nothing to do with the Government's initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not an extraordinary coincidence that Sir Charles Gray made such a pronouncement at a time when the Bill was not half way through its passage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Committee will start as it will finish—by sticking to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. The amendment is about consultation by school boards. Moreover, it is not "Sir" but "Mr" Charles Gray.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, will my hon. Friend make the necessary representations to ensure that Mr. Charles Gray quickly becomes Sir Charles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Mr. Charles Gray can implement those proposals in Strathclyde, he will indeed be a great man. But I must not digress from the amendment. The hon. Member for Maryhill argued for wider consultation, but it would be difficult for the school boards to act on the representations that they received because matters would already be in the hands of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would provide for consultation before the proposals were submitted to the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is surely possible for school boards to consult more fully. I accept that the time allotted by the Minister is inadequate for realistic consultation but that could also be amended. It is technically possible to consult other bodies before—not after—submitting proposals to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads clause 16(2)(a) and (b) he will discover that school boards are required simultaneously to publish and submit the proposals to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say so in terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does. I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) It shall be the duty of the school board, before the end of the period of one month beginning with the date on which the result of the ballot is determined or of such longer period as the Secretary of State may permit—
	<ol>
	<li>to publish, in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations, proposals for acquisition of self-governing status for the school: and</li>
	<li>to submit to the Secretary of State, to the education authority and. where the school is a denominational school, to the church or other denominational body in whose interest the school is managed a copy of the published proposals."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Paragraphs (a) and (b) are linked by what used to be described as a conjunction. That means that the two aspects—publishing and submitting—should happen together. It is not sensible to submit proposals to the Secretary of State and consult on them at the same time. That would make it impossible to alter them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is arguing that the wording of the amendment is faulty, but does he accept the principle that consultation should take place before publishing or submitting proposals to the Secretary of State? If so, the Opposition will be happy because we wish to ensure proper consultation so that people have an opportunity to air their views. If that is the Minister's problem, we shall gladly accept a change to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I should like to, it is not my job to make the hon. Lady happy. Her amendment does not make sense. It would place on a school board a duty that it could not fulfil—to consult on a proposal and submit it to the Secretary of State at the same time. I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument does not stand up. Clause 16(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the school board, before the end of the period of one month … to publish, in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations, proposals for acquisition of self-governing status for the school."</p></blockquote>
The board has one month to publish those proposals. Amendment No. 136 would allow school boards to consult interested parties in that month. The Minister said that he has written into the Bill a prohibition that will prevent school boards from carrying out consultations. But he has not. Although paragraphs (a) and (b) are joined by the conjunction "and", neither contains an explicit time requirement. The amendments would allow for that consultation with any interested parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What different powers will be available to schools after consultation has taken place, in the light of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, the present Bill, and the new proposals from Strathclyde regional council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to follow the logic of that question, but it is entirely irrelevant to the amendments. It has nothing to do with the Strathclyde proposals. Charles Gray is reported to have stated explicitly that he does not believe that the majority of parents will be interested in opting out. He is not interested, and is very keen to oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the different treatment that is to be meted out to Scottish schools, compared with English schools under the Education Reform Act 1988. Scottish schools will have only one month to publish opting-out proposals, but English schools have six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Education and Science document dealing with proposals for grant-maintained status—which is the same as self-governing status, despite what Conservative Members may say—sets out the duties of governing bodies, which are the English equivalent of school boards. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body will have to publish its proposals for grant-maintained status within six months."</p></blockquote>
That is not just an arbitrary decision, whereby the Secretary of State for Education and Science believes six months to be appropriate and the Secretary of State for Scotland prefers one month, because the document states that it is important that there is time to
	<br><blockquote><p>"assemble various items of information, some of which will be needed by the Secretary of State to help him reach his decision, and some of which will be important to members of the public who may want to comment."</p></blockquote>
That is the sort of consultation that we want in Scotland as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public will be interested in proposals for schools to apply for self-governing status. The Minister is arguing that they should not have an opportunity to make representations to the school board at the stage when it is preparing its proposals for the Secretary of State for Scotland. They must wait for the proposals to reach the Secretary of State, and make representations to him rather than to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
school board. People in the community may prefer to speak directly to the school board before the proposals are passed on to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is wrong to say that the amendment cannot be made and that school boards cannot consult bodies that are genuinely interested in the proposals to the Secretary of State. Even if the amendment is technically deficient, that is not sufficient reason for opposing it. The Minister's civil servants can tidy it up so that it is technically competent and will allow school boards to consult others before passing on their proposals to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot have it both ways; he cannot argue that school boards are a marvellous means of consultation about school provision, yet maintain that they cannot consult people about one of the most important decisions that they might make—to take their school out of education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants to be consistent, he must find a means of allowing school boards to consult those who are interested in their decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is confused. He must be clear about the procedure for the ballot. He argues that outside bodies should have an opportunity to comment on self-governing status. The Bill provides for that. When proposals are sent to the Secretary of State, the world and his wife—or the world and her husband—will have an opportunity to express their views about them. The Secretary of State can then take account of those representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will be put forward with the ballot paper. A proposal that goes to the Secretary of State will have been endorsed by a majority of parents who voted in the ballot. I do not know how the hon. Gentleman envisages that school boards can alter proposals that have been endorsed by a majority in a ballot, through consultation after the proposals have been sent to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill allows one month for wider consultation on the proposals that have been endorsed by parents. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) has tabled an amendment to extend that period to two months, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). The hon. Member for Dundee, East has suggested six months, although he has not tabled an amendment to that effect. I am sure that he will use the amendment of the hon. Member for Moray to present a case for an extension to six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 136, which was moved so eloquently by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), is deficient and based on woolly thinking, which is uncharacteristic of her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Minister's mind that is woolly. The opposition would be satisfied if the Minister accepted the principle of consultation before paragraphs (a) and (b) are triggered. He believes, however, that the word "and", when it links
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
two concepts, or events, implies that those events occur simultaneously. When he orders a gin and tonic, does he complain if the gin is poured first and the tonic afterwards? There are many well-known pairings in the language, such as love and marriage. Does he believe that the two always go together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But not always simultaneously. Where does the Minister get the idea that the link word "and" implies that the two parts are simultaneous? I wonder where he learnt English. Did he pass his English exam?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was unconvincing. It did not convince me or any of my hon. Friends. Outside interests could be the local community served by that school. It is pejorative to call them outside interests, because they have a direct interest in the school. Parents of children in primary schools attached to the school will be excluded from the democractic process because the Minister will not allow them to participate in the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that those outside interests will be able to comment, but only to the Secretary of Staet for Scotland. They will not be able to influence the proposals of the school board to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Minister went on to say that the Secretary of State for Scotland will take account of the views of outside interests as well as those of the school board and the parental majority in favour of the proposals. On one hand will be the parents and the school board who want the proposals for self-governing status to go ahead, and on the other will be the outside interests who seek to comment on and change the proposals. The Minister wants the Secretary of State for Scotland to play off one group against the other and to say that the view of the parents and the school board is the prime view and that the views of everywone else should not be counted. We want the views of everyone else to be put to the school board so as to influence its view before it reaches the Secretary of State. The Minister refuses to confront that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that the proposals put to the Secretary of State for Scotland will be the same as those put to the parents in the ballot. He said that he would deal with this matter on Report, but the Bill currently contains no guarantee that the proposals will be exactly the same. They may be different. They may be couched in general terms when they are put to parents in the ballot, but by the time they have passed to the Secretary of State for Scotland they may have become more specific and have far wider implications for the school, the parents and the pupils than the general proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that before the school board and the parental majority are committed to certain proposals they should consult widely the local community. Someone may persuade the board that its proposals are not right or not in the spirit of the decision taken by the parents in the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
The Minister ignores those important implications and wants to defeat the amendment in the hope that he will be able to play off the parental vote and the school board decision against the other legitimate interests. He wants to divide people involved in education instead of bringing them together to produce proposals that the whole community would accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) not to withdraw the amendment, or at least to return to it on Report because it is an important principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Conservative Member has anything useful to say and the Minister is abetted by people who do not even know who Mr. Charles Gray is, thereby displaying their ignorance of Scottish education. That is a smokescreen for their failure to recognise the needs of the wider community and its right to have a say in how a school is managed. Therefore, I see no reason to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is, That the amendment be made. As many as are of that opinion say, "Aye".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Aye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the contrary, "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ayes have it. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I now come to amendment No. 191 —</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I distinctly heard myself say, "No."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I moved on to another amendment, I do not think that I said "The Ayes have it." Therefore, I shall have to put the Question again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Martin. The amendment will not shake Scottish education to its foundations. However, if Conservative Members are so disorganised that they cannot respond when you put the Question, it begs the question of whether the Committee has accepted the amendment. Indeed, Mr. Martin, you were about to move on to other business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) heard me say, "No". The amendment is not of great consequence, but the procedure is clear and we have become used to it in this Committee.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) It shall be the duty of the education authority—

	<li>to provide the school board with such information as the board may require to assist it in preparing the proposals; and</li>

(2AA) It shall be the duty of the head teacher to assist the school board in the discharge of their duties under subsection (2) above."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 192.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, any work that I was doing concerned the amendment. It had nothing to do with comics. If any hon. Member has comics, I should like to see them some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 191 is important as it deals with activities that could become practice if and when any school board decides to opt out and become self-governing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a debate on an earlier amendment I gave five examples of local authorities in England that were trying to frustrate the wishes of school boards and parents. Amendment No. 191 makes it a duty for the education authority to provide information to assist the board in preparing its proposals. When I tabled the amendment, I did not have the advantage of having read this morning's papers. The Institute of Local Government studies at Birmingham university prepared a report. It is interesting that, when questions were put to an official of Strathclyde regional council, whom the institute thought would know the answers, the official replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I don't think we know what happens in schools and colleges".</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to that comment because it came from an official in the largest education authority in Scotland. If we are to obtain information as required by my amendment, an education authority should know what is going on in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to debates on previous amendments. I said that there would be a need for schools to know about costs. We had a debate on cost and profit, and I was chastised by Opposition Members who assured me that education authorities in Scotland knew their stuff. But the largest authority—Strathclyde—does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
The report also quoted an unnamed regional councillor as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We spend almost nine hundred million on the education service, but do we really know how well spent that money is? I am quite sure that we have many good schools and large numbers of excellent and dedicated teachers, but also some bad ones … But have we any way of knowing? Does anybody know?"</p></blockquote>
That is interesting, because one of the great advantages that the Bill has had in Scotland is that it has helped to concentrate minds. If my amendment will help to concentrate minds on costs, expenses and other important things, we will do education in Scotland a good service. The Opposition have tried to make out that Conservative Members have been scaremongering about what needs to be done in Scotland, but an independent body and Strathcldye councillors say the same as we do.

Mr. Charles Gray was previously referred to as Sir Charles Gray, although he has no title. He now seems to be speaking the language of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Mr. Charles Gray, who is a powerful and influential gentleman in the Labour party, will have something to say about that. Perhaps we should do that, because it is beneficial to us that the leading light in the Labour party, one of its acknowledged leaders in education, agrees with us. I hope that what have to say about Sir Charles Gray—[Hon. Members: "Mr."]—will not affect his future. It is easy to slip into that mistake. Mr. Gray is reported in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For five years before that, as deputy leader of the council. I had been battering my head against a brick wall, trying to get a study like this to improve the quality of education, so with great respect this has"—</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be accused of speaking on behalf of the EIS, although I was told by one of its leading members that my stance on teachers' pay had brought it to its senses in that respect. I said that, if it wanted a review, it must be on pay and conditions, because no employer would contemplate reviewing pay in isolation. Because of the tough line that I adopted at my first meeting with the EIS, it came to its senses. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The vice-president of the EIS told me that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noted that, whereas many of our colleagues have congratulated Mr. Charles Gray, none of Mr. Gray's friends on the Opposition Benches have given one word of support? Are they embarrassed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members may accuse us of confusion, but the only confusion is theirs. The major education authority in Scotland, which represents the majority of children and parents, is lining up with the Government. That is natural evolution. My amendment calls for an education authority to have a duty to provide schools with information, so an authority must have or be able to get that information. Our debate has highlighted the concern in Scotland about the state of education and whether the education authorities are in command of their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the head teacher to assist the school board in the discharge of their duties".</p></blockquote>
That has been included because, in England, there was an instance in which a head teacher, because he was an employee of the local authority, was frustrated in his attempt to give information to a school board. We must ensure that, if a school board and parents wish to take advantage of the legislation, they are not frustrated by the education authority either using its enormous influence, which is due to its massive spending power, or leaning on head teachers to prevent them assisting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenses reasonably incurred by the board in pursuance of its duties".</p></blockquote>
We have already dealt with the legal and other costs that could arise if parents and the school board want a school to pursue the opportunity of acquiring self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charles Gray reached an agreement with the Government on a technology academy, but he was frustrated and voted down by his Labour colleagues. That might be only temporary, as Strathclyde regional council may review its position in the light of current events. A chink of light is finally reaching those people in local government who maintain that everything that they do is right because, to use the Labour party's language, they have a mandate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

There is a mood in Scotland that improvements could and should be made in education. The amendment would ensure that education authorities must have information. They cannot pass on information if they do not have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph (a) of the amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with such information as the board may require".</p></blockquote>
Will the hon. Gentleman list that required information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman referring to subsection (2AA)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The board would require the information that Strathclyde regional council, according to its official, does not have. We do not know what happens in schools and colleges and what are the cost aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We raised the matter of costs earlier, and I was chastised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), who assured me that education authorities had them at their fingertips. The Strathclyde official must have funny fingertips, because he does not appear to know his council's costs. I am a reasonable chap, and I am prepared to believe that that official is the only one out of touch. But why did a regional councillor say that the council did not know what was going on? It spent a vast sum—£900 million—on the education service. That is why we must ensure that the education authority has the information that the board may require to assist it in preparing its proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board must know the true costs of the school—the rates, the lighting bills and other relevant information. When considering specialist education, in which the school may have expertise, the board must be aware of the future possible intake of qualified teachers. Such information is necessary to run anything, and a school is no different from any other organisation. Good decisions can be made only on the basis of adequate information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman is surprised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a devastating remark. I understand the amendment's purpose. The hon. Gentleman says that information is required to make decisions. But, if such information is required, it should be available before the ballot. The information might suggest that the school should not have become self-governing. Surely the amendment is in the wrong place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Gentleman, I must quote again Strathclyde regional council. Mr. Charles Gray says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools and colleges would have far more control over their own affairs, particularly in handling their own budgets. A slimmed-down Glasgow headquarters"—</p></blockquote>
the Strathclyde education authority headquarters—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would deal only with future strategy while the region's six divisions would handle operations in co-operation with local schools and colleges."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
Information on the co-operation between local schools and colleges and the relationship with the local subdivision of the education authority is important. Strathclyde regional council continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A quality assurance unit would be created to set down and publish success criteria for schools and colleges. And, as a cornerstone to the Strathclyde plan, local financial management would be introduced this year to start the spead of what the council describes as more devolution and accountability."</p></blockquote>
I am quoting Strathclyde regional council and Charles Gray. I should have thought that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) would not be confused, as Charles Gray is a friend of his. He is not a friend of mine—I cannot remember whether I have even met him. However, I know that he had done a great service to Scotland and an even greater service to the Committee. He has given us the opportunity to see clearly that, if Strathclyde region's education authority—the largest in Scotland—recognises the need for adequate information on which to base decisions, that information should also be made available to the board. I hope thay my hon. Friends will support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was so anxious to speak about Charles Gray that he became confused about the amendment. The amendment is to clause 16, which is about the proposals that the school board must publish when it states its intention to seek self-governing status. Indeed, the clause sets out in detail the information that must be included in those proposals. I fail to see why that information must be provided by the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first piece of information that the board will be required to publish in its proposals is the number of parent and staff members on the school board. I should have thought that, as the school board is publishing those proposals, it would know its membership and would not have to contact the education authority to find out who sits on the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause goes on to say that the proposals must state the number of persons who will be appointed to the board and their period of office. The number of persons to be appointed to the board will be decided not by the education authority but by the school board. Surely the school board should know that without asking the education authority. Similarly, the period of office for which those people will be expected to serve will be determined by the Bill. It is not for the education authority to provide the school board with information about the period of office for which appointed members can serve. It is up to Parliament to tell it. Therefore, it would be false for any school board to seek such information from the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 16 is about proposals for the acquisiton of self-governing status, so the information for which the amendment calls is not just about membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads clause 16 he will see that it does not require a school board to state in the proposals that it puts forward to the Secretary of State for Scotland the electricity costs, rates and general costs for the school. I am directing the hon. Gentleman's attention to what is required in the proposals, and I shall continue with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause then requires information about school board members to be provided. The education authority cannot be expected to provide that information to school board members themselves. I should have thought that school board members knew enough about themselves to include such information in the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 16(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies where … section 14 of this Act shows a simple majority of votes cast … in favour of seeking such status."</p></blockquote>
The information that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) wants to have from the education authority would be redundant, because the vote would have been taken and any negotiation between the school board and the Scottish Office would have been finalised. The education authority would have no role to play. Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment is misplaced and does not belong with the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the amendment is entirely misplaced and has no relevance to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also provides that the proposals will have to set out the arrangements for the admission of pupils to the school. It is not for the education authority to tell the school boards what the arrangements will be. At a previous sitting, the Minister said that the school boards would make their own arrangements for the admission of pupils. So why should they seek from the education authority information about arrangements for which they are responsible? It is not for the authority to tell them about admission arrangements; it is for the boards to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to subsection (3)(e)(iii), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other aspects of the management of the school as the school board think fit".</p></blockquote>
That is to be included in the proposals. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman thinks that the proposals should not cover the obtaining of information so that the school boards can comply with that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If school boards think fit to supply information, it is up to them to find out that information for themselves. We cannot put a statutory responsibility on the school boards. In any case, information that the school boards may think fit, may not be information that the Minister thinks
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
fit to be included in the proposals, otherwise he would have ensured that such a provision was in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am dealing with what the Bill tells the school boards they must include in their proposals to the education authority. I know that the hon. Gentleman does not like that, because all the information that the Bill says must be included in the proposals has little or no relevance to the education authority, and torpedoes the amendment. That is why the hon. Gentleman does not like me doing this, but I shall persist and go through the clause item by item to drive home to the hon. Gentleman what nonsense, garbage and rubbish—to use the hon. Gentleman's words—the amendment is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not taken into account the relevance of amendment No. 85, in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and myself. The amendment refers to subsection (3)(e)(iii), on
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other aspects of the management of the school as the school board think fit"</p></blockquote>
and would replace "school board" with "the Secretary of State". The two amendments are therefore linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the two amendments were linked, they would have been grouped together. However, since you have ruled, Mr. Martin, that we should debate amendment No. 191 separately, we shall deal with it separately. I know that it embarrasses the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) that his name is on the amendment, but we shall go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that the school board will also have to find out what special emphasis will characterise the school's education. Again, that is a matter for the board, not the education authority. The board must also find out about the management of the school. Does the hon. Member for Tayside, North suggest that the education authority should tell the school board how it should manage a self-governing school? Is that the type of information that the hon. Gentleman wishes to be made available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that the proposals should specify the proposed date of implementation of self-governing status. Who is to know that? According to the amendment, is the education authority to provide the information to the school boards so that they will know when to implement the proposals? That is a matter for the school boards and the Secretary of State for Scotland, after consulting various interested bodies. The amendment is nonsense and should be thrown out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the amendment of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), it would be up to the education authority to state whether the school was an institution for the provision of primary or secondary education. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that some school boards
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
will be unable to decide whether their schools are primary or secondary schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. If the amendment were accepted, the school board could not find out whether the school would be primary or secondary, so it would have to ask the education authority. Similarly, if it could not decide whether the school should have a nursery class, or did not know how many yearly stages there would be, it would have to seek that information from the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the amendment conveys to the Minister the startling lack of confidence of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in the future of self-managed schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head. I cannot think of any other reason why a Conservative Member would submit such an amendment. It undermines the position of school boards, as they would be unable to make any decisions unless they obtained the information about themselves from the education authority. The hon. Member for Tayside, North appears to think that the education authority will know more about the school boards than they will know themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy if the provision of special education were left to the education authority, but the Minister is keen that the authority should not decide about that. Special education provision will be decided independently by the board of management. Why should the school board seek information on it from the education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements whereby
	<br><blockquote><p>"pupils are admitted to the school by reference to ability and aptitude"</p></blockquote>
are not matters for the education authority and neither is whether the school is a single-sex or a denominational school. None of the information that is required to be placed in the proposals by the school board has anything to do with the education authority, so it is beyond me why we should debate an amendment that says that the education authority should fund the school board to find out that information.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should the education authority be expected to pay for the school board to discover who its members are, what its intentions are and so on? That is a matter for the school board and the Minister. If the Government are keen to get self-governing schools on to the statute book and into existence in Scotland, they have to find the money for school boards to find out about themselves. They should not drag in the education authorities and impose further costs on them for developments for which they have no responsibility and on which they have no information. I urge the Minister to treat the amendment as he treats other amendments that he regards as technically incompetent and to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was entirely in order but a little intemperate, even for him, and very long, although that is no great surprise. Amendment No. 191, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), is perfectly reasonable and is clearly related to amendment No. 85, which prescribes that the Secretary of State would set out aspects of the management of the school that the school board would need to cover in preparing the proposals. Whether it is needed in the light of the report to which my hon. Friend referred is an open matter. If the Strathclyde proposals were enacted, it would be difficult to see what information the school board would need from the education authority that it would not have under those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North said that the Strathclyde proposals and the Government proposals were in line. It should be put on the record that that is not Strathclyde's position. I hope that this is not an unparliamentary term, but according to 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> Strathclyde claimed that my hon. Friend the Minister was a sneak-thief and said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any worthwhile idea like school boards or developments in post-compulsory education he had stolen from Strathclyde and dressed in Tory clothes."</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly new development in criticisms of my hon. Friend. Many education sources have criticised him, but to suggest that he is really secretly stealing proposals from the Strathclyde Labour group— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> In the light of that praise for Charles Gray, perhaps my hon. Friend is not a closet Socialist but a closet admirer and fully paid up member of the Charles Gray supporters' club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Strathclyde report, there are still arguments for the amendment. Obviously one cannot guarantee either that those proposals will be implemented in Strathclyde or that they will be followed by other authorities. The hon. Members for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and for Dundee, East spoke at great length without mentioning the report once. I was reassured by sedentary interventions which suggested that there would be a definitive statement from Opposition Members. This would be a reasonable debate in which to make a statement on that report. However, I warn them that we have not heard from the Educational Institute of Scotland on those matters and it seems inevitable that the EIS will criticise the proposals because there is something about them that it will find wholly unacceptable. They were prepared by the Institute of Local Government at Birmingham university and the EIS cannot possibly accept that anything good in education could ever come from south of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he believes that the EIS would automatically reject anything and everything that came from Inlogov?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The history of recent education policy is that the EIS takes the line that anything that is proposed from England is automatically wrong
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
and is described as the anglicisation of Scottish education. If I am wrong, and if the EIS, knowing that we are discussing the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) on information, is even at this moment issuing press statements saying that the general direction of the report is right, I am happy to withdraw my criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Opposition will make a statement about those matters, as they have promised. One can light-heartedly praise Strathclyde, but there are serious issues about information and that is what the amendment is about. It is being proposed, first, that there should be much more information and, secondly, that it should be devolved to school level. I should have thought that both those proposals would commend themselves, at least to Conservative Members, and we wait with bated breath for the establishment of unanimity on those matters in the winding-up speech from the Opposition Front Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for his comments and I, too, wait with bated breath to hear what the Opposition have to say on the developments in Strathclyde, which are relevant to the amendment. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), while not in a form that I could accept, was soundly based, and when I comment on amendment No. 192 I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about the EIS and the astonishment of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) as to why my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood thought that the Inlogov report would be opposed, one can never rely simply on newspaper cuttings, but I am struck by the comment in today's issue of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on the Strathclyde report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main thrust of its recommendations, devolving power to schools and colleges, is being adopted for discussion by the council. In return for the extra power, which Strathclyde believes could exceed that offered by government legislation, the schools will be called to account for what they are trying to achieve for their communities."</p></blockquote>
That sounds remarkably like the speeches that were made by my hon. Friends on clause 1. It is a remarkable change, which we welcome, and I hope that the Opposition will welcome it. We shall be fascinated to hear how they square that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we took the view that the EIS was an impartial, fair-minded body, we could expect it to turn its campaign against the report and against Charles Gray, and we could expect the Labour party to support Strathclyde and to oppose the EIS in any campaigning against those interesting proposals. Whether Strathclyde wishes to claim that we stole its ideas or whether it is copying us is neither here nor there; what matters is that it is proposing substantial delegation of power to schools and local communities very much in line with legislation that has been passed by the House and with this Bill. I am sure that the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 and the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill will be of great benefit to Councillor Gray and his colleagues in implementing the proposals. It will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
interesting to see what happens to the campaign against anglicisation now that Scotland's largest education authority appears to have embraced the principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will accept that the proposals were reported in the press only this morning and that none of us should judge them on the basis of press reports alone. Until we have read the discussion paper, we shall not know the full flavour of the proposals. The important fact is that they will not be implemented in Strathclyde without consultation with trade unions and parents. The Minister has been lamentably lacking. He may consult people, but he then ignores what they say, whereas Strathclyde will take it into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning's 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i>—I was astonished to read it myself—says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The region supports the idea of school boards, and council leader Councillor Charles Gray said the region should go further than current Government policy, and invest even greater power in the boards. He believes that, with significant powers given to boards parents will be discouraged from opting out of the present system. The ideas for local financial management will be tried out in pilot schools from the beginning of the next session.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Councillor Gray said that if parents gave the region a chance to increase the power to school boards it was unlikely they would want to opt out. He added that school boards were policy in Strathclyde three years ago, and the idea had been 'dressed up in Tory clothes' by the Government.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Headmasters would ultimately be in charge of their own budgets under the new proposals."</p></blockquote>
That does not sound like consultation. The new school session is less than six months away, so the consultation process will be considerably shorter than that which was carried out by the Government on the proposals in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the proposals have been part of Labour party thinking for the past five years, why has the Committee spent so long listening to the Opposition's complaints about the Bill? Why is their opposition to it so vehement, if everything that the Government are doing is already Labour party policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every day we hear new revelations of what Labour party policy has really been—although the party has never managed to articulate it. The explanation that my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) seeks is that the proposals are not the policy of the Educational Institute of Scotland. The Opposition have not spoken, because they have not yet received their orders from the EIS, so they are not sure what to say. Although the leader of Scotland's largest education authority has spectacularly and bravely committed himself, Opposition Members sit on their hands because they are worried about what their position should be. The clue was provided when the hon. Member for Dundee, East said that the proposals would be implemented only after consultation with staff. That was the code for "only after we have heard what the EIS says about it all."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood, I wonder why we are discussing the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
at such great length and why Opposition Members will not embrace it. Another clue is provided by councillor Gray's remarks. The party and the local authority which so vehemently opposed school boards are now committed to them. The party which was in favour of school boards only if their powers were limited now argues that those boards should be given powers beyond those in the original legislation. We argued during the Committee stage of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 that that would happen, but it has happened even more rapidly than I expected. We can claim a first victory for the Bill before it has even passed through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to the preparation and publication by a school board of proposals for the acquisition of self-governing status for the school, after a successful ballot of parents. My hon. Friends and I are of one mind on those points. It is desirable that the expenses reasonably incurred by the board in preparing and publishing proposals should be reimbursed. My hon. Friends suggest that this should be done by the education authority. My amendment goes one better and proposes that the cost should fall on the Secretary of State, in line with the provisions under clause 14(6) on reimbursement of the cost of ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to accpept in principle the further elements in amendment No. 191 which require the education authority to provide the school board with information needed to assist it in preparing proposals. In particular, the amendment would require
	<br><blockquote><p>"the head teacher to assist the school board in the discharge of their duties"</p></blockquote>
of preparing and publishing the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must point out to the hon. Member for Dundee, East that education authorities and head teachers already have a general duty to provide information and advice to school boards under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. I hope that any sensible education authority or head teacher will be prepared to provide the school board with information and assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating proposals which school boards will put to the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Bill clearly sets out the information that is required, but the education authority holds almost none of it. It is within the boards' remit to collate that information which they have. Why should the education authority be required to provide information which boards already have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In preparing its proposals, the school board may need additional information to reach conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For example, in describing admission arrangements. It may want to look at catchment areas, which we shall discuss later. It may want detailed information about the education authority's future plans, and other details that it might not get were it not for the duty on the education authority to provide information to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
school boards. We want to be absolutely certain that, in opting for self-governing status, that information can be supplied. Government amendment No. 192 would ensure that the school board is confident that its expenses in putting together a proposal are underwritten by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Experience south of the border and the disgraceful tactics used by Labour councils to prevent and frustrate the opting-out process by seeking to challenge head teachers and their right to co-operate—in this case, with the school board—show that it is highly desirable that the head teacher be given a specific duty to assist the board in this way, as amendment No. 191, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North would ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed vexatious litigation and the difficulties that have been experienced in the south, and I have given an undertaken on that. In respect of amendment No. 191, it should be the duty of the head teacher
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assist the school board in the discharge of their duties under subsection (2) above."</p></blockquote>
That makes it perfectly clear that, in addition to the duties placed on him by the School Boards (Scotland) Act, there should be a requirement that, in preparing proposals for self-governing status and, perhaps, other aspects of opting for self-governing status, the head's duty to the board should be made clear. I am happy to embrace that point and table an amendment at a later stage to meet the spirit of my hon. Friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North to withdraw amendment No. 191 on the basis that I shall embrace its spirit. I ask the Committee to support amendment No. 192, which will ensure that, when preparing proposals, funds are available to the school board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to speak to amendment No. 191, moved by the hon.

Strathclyde regional council was set up in 1975, when massive problems in education resulted, not least, in a shortage of teachers. That body removed that blight from education.

Strathclyde regional council dealt well with its first job. The sub-divisions were a legacy of the old counties. I know from experience that the old county structure worked well. When Strathclyde regional council was formed there was a blockage between what was happening at county and regional levels because there was too much power at the regional level. I consistently made that point to education officers and councillors. In fact, I was involved in establishing a local community project in my area, which was hampered by the management arrangements in Strathclyde. I am not a convert to the management structure in education. If the preess release had not appeared in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> the hon.

Conservative Members have put me off what I was going to say. I wish to return to the amendment of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. It is a woolly amendment. Clause 16(2) requires that the work done by the education authority has to be completed within one month. New subsection (2A) proposes that certain actions should be the duty of the education authority. That is inimical to the thrust of
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
his proposition. There would be a legal basis for any decision or advice given by an education authority if it had a duty to perform certain functions. There would be an incumbency on school boards. The amendment gives more power back to education authorities than he thinks. Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 191 is open-ended and suggests that the hon. Gentleman has not thought it out, because paragraph (a) implies that nothing could not be requisitioned from the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman commented that I should have made a different speech. I was prepared to talk about experiences in England which prompted me into tabling the amendment. My amendment may have something wrong with it, but I have at least, received a pledge from the Minister that he will table something that will meet its aims and objectives. I am satisfied with that because I did not think for a minute that my amendment would be technically correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it be that some financial or confidential information is not available to the school board?

Paragraph (b) talks of
	<br><blockquote><p>"to meet expenses reasonably incurred".</p></blockquote>
"Reasonably" is the type of word that leads to litigation. What is reasonable to one side is unreasonable to another. Would the expenses of a school board's advertising budget have to be reimbursed by the local authority? The paragraph should be much more tightly defined that the hon. Gentleman now suggests. New subsection (2AA) deals with the duty of the head teacher. As the Minister said, there will be general requirements on the head teacher to assist the school board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's problem is that he is making his speech after the Minister has completed his observations and comments. The hon. Gentleman's speech would have been in order if we had been having a general debate, but my hon. Friend the Minister has replied. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is contributing nothing to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he would come back to these matters on Report. My points are legitimate and I hope that the Minister will take them into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On previous amendments, we referred to the possibility of a rolling campaign by 12 to 15 dissatisfied parents who could ensure that the school board has elections every year. The elections last for three months. In that case the head teacher would have to devote all his time to the school board and education requirements would be disadvantaged. That is why the amendment must be much tighter. I hope that the Minister will listen to those criticisms so, if the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, it will be much more tightly defined by Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not have risen to speak to amendment No. 191 but for what the Minister said in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) rightly pointed out that what the amendment asked the education authority to provide for school boards and the items listed in the clause were matters that a school board should be aware of itself. My hon. Friend detailed that very powerfully and all of us listening accepted his point. In dealing with it the Minister suggested that education authorities would be responsible for providing school boards with items outwith the specific ones listed in the clause. He did not state what new limits would be set upon that type of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he would accept the principle, if not the detail, of the amendment so we need to know what type of information the education authority will be expected to provide to the school boards. He seemed to suggest that the information required would be more than the items listed in the clause. If that is so, what type of details and background information will education authorities have a duty to provide? If the list is open-ended, it will place an onerous and expensive duty upon education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to imply that a school board might require background information to assist policy decisions about a future board of management. One wonders about the limits of the education authority's duty in preparing such background information. A school board might want to know not just about its catchment area, but about schools in other catchment areas and possibly about other schools outside the bounds of its education authority, as it considers its future as a potentially self-managed school. It might want information on practices in other education authorities in Scotland, or on how schools operate in England, to help decide how the rules should be devised for its future as a self-managed school. Why stop at England? It might want to find out about educational practices in other parts of the world and in other countries on the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential information that could be relevant to a school board in deciding its potential policies and characteristics as a self-managed school is infinite. The Minister cannot give an open-ended commitment to the principle of the amendment. Clause 16 has at least the virtue of being precisely defined, even if it is redundant as the school board should have the information anyway. If the Minister believes that the information that the education authority has a duty to provide is outwith clause 16, he must say what the limits of such information will be. If those limits will be very much wider, we must know who will be expected to pay for that background information-gathering exercise. The costs of gathering, collating and assessing that information and of providing it in a way that a school board can digest readily could be considerable. Such an exercise would take up many hours and a great deal of money.

Friend's proposals were the most frightful nonsense because none of the information was required by the school board. The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) finished by saying that those proposals could put far too onerous obligations on the education authority. Both positions cannot be correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the point that I did because, although the Minister acknowledged implicitly that the matters in clause 16 should be known to the board, he implied that the duty on the education authorities would have to be wider than the matters specified in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that amendments Nos. 191 and 85 were linked. If he withdraws amendment No. 191, can I assume that the hon. Member for Eastwood will withdraw amendment No. 85?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair question. In the light of this debate, I shall introduce amendment No. 85 later by saying that it is a probing amendment. That would show that I was not proposing to push the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) made the most fascinating speech of the morning. It was warmly welcomed on this side of the Committee, especially by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State. I do not think that my right hon. and learned Friend's pleasure was shared by the Opposition Front Bench, but the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will probably make the Opposition's position clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is right to suggest that there is substance in the principle of the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, particularly with regard to the duties of the head teacher. But I agree that the amendment, which I support, may not be technically correct. Indeed, my hon. Friend made it clear that neither he nor I expected it to be technically correct. It is the inevitable fate of Back-Bench Members to propose amendments in the knowledge that they encapsulate a point of view but that they may not be entirely accurate.

	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
The hon. Member for Western Isles has a point about a possible onerous duty on an education authority. There is clearly an implicit test of reasonableness, but perhaps an amendment could be drafted including the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"such information as the board may reasonably require".</p></blockquote>
That would cover an education authority asked, for example, to provide information on every education system worldwide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I was glad that my hon. Friend the Minister said what he did about new subsection (2AA). My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North has a genuine point about the head teacher's role. Without suggesting that anyone would react with anything but the best of motives to a given situation, the new subsection would clarify the head teacher's position, and that is bound to be helpful to the head teacher. The hon. Member for Western Isles suggested that the head teacher might have to spend all his or her time on such matters, but I doubt whether that would happen. My hon. Friend the Minister will undoubtedly take that into account in framing an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I am not dealing with the Strathclyde report. It will be more appropriate to do so in the context of this afternoon's discussions. We do not have the same Pavlovian responses as Conservative Members. When I read about the Strathclyde report, I wondered how long the Minister would take before he mentioned it. I thought that it would take about 60 seconds, but he managed it within 30 seconds. He is nothing if not predictable. I also wondered whether any Conservative Members would stand up and not mention it. I thought that there might be one or two, but I did them a great disservice, because without fail, every Conservative Member felt obliged to say something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the Educational Institute of Scotland. I understand the hatred of the hon. Member for Eastwood for the EIS, as it was the organisation that resulted in his being sacked from the Scottish Office. The Secretary of State for Scotland replaced the hon. Gentleman with a carpet salesman. But the hon. Gentleman should not use his prejudice against the EIS to try to throw education in Scotland into a turmoil. However, I shall come back to that point this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a genuine request for information. I am not making a party political point. I wish to raise a serious point, which it is important to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, schools have a great deal of potential autonomy although admittedly, they cannot hire or fire and they cannot buy their own buildings. Given that autonomy, what Mr. Charles Gray has said that Strathclyde regional council intends to do, and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
proposals in the Bill, what is the difference between the Strathclyde proposals, what schools can do under the 1988 Act and what they can do under the Bill? That is the key point of this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not realise the difference between what Charlie Gray—as he is known—says and what is in the Bill, he understands the Bill even less than I thought. He should go away and read it, and if he still does not understand it by this afternoon, I shall explain it to him. If you cannot understand the difference between opting out and the devolution of power in an education authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can well understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had said something about Strathclyde to deserve that, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said that he was not making a party political point. The reply to that is, "Do you think my head's buttoned up the back?", as they say in the west of Scotland. The reply to that, incidentally, is, "No, it looks as if it is buttoned up the front".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talked about Pavlovian responses. Why was the hon. Member for Dumbarton able to give a clear, articulate and full view on the report, whereas the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is unable to do so until 4.30 pm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Martin. Unfortunately, Conservative Members have certain prejudices that they like to have fulfilled. They attribute various views and pressures to Opposition Members, none of which exist. Unlike Conservative Members, we are free thinkers. Conservative Members made such fools of themselves over the Church of Scotland that they should be very cautious and not do so again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As he has the press cuttings in front of him, I imagine that the hon. Gentleman has been reading the comments of the STUC president in Aberdeen, who accused the Tories of having done a U-turn on opting out. Has the Labour party in Strathclyde also done a U-turn in supporting the measures in the 1988 Act and the proposals in this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would prefer it if we restricted the debate to the amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Martin, tempted as I am by Conservative Members to stray from the amendment.

	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could explain to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), who raised the matter with me earlier, the difference between what Charlie Gray and his supporters say and what is in the Bill. I realise, Mr. Martin, that I had better not be tempted to stray any further. I return to the information because I am not clear about this. As the hon. Member for Tayside, North will recall, I intervened in his speech to ask what information would be required. All that he could cite was cost. He could not tell me anything more. I can understand why a school board may want further information, but what type of information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had my speech prepared before I saw the press releases this morning. My speech contained all the experience in England but I did not want to be accused by the Chairman of filibustering and covering ground that I had covered quite a bit of in earlier amendments. I had adequate information, particularly about head teachers and the activities of education authorities. However, with Strathclyde adopting its position, and in order to be constructive it seemed right to concentrate on the Scottish dimension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for replying. When I intervened earlier, I asked for clarification about subsection (2A)(a) of the amendment which reads,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide the school board with such information as the board may require".</p></blockquote>
The only example that the hon. Gentleman could give me was cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I drew the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that as a result of the report that it had received from Birmingham university Strathclyde said that it did not have the information available. If nothing else, my amendment would make education authorities look at the sort of information that they should have available which Strathclyde admits it does not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument is becoming rather circular and I shall not pursue it here. I was trying to ascertain the sort of information that we are talking about. The information that the hon. Member for Tayside, North was suggesting, such as cost and whether a building was about to fall down, is something that one would want to know before deciding whether a school should opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely quoting a Strathclyde Official who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not think we know what happens in schools and colleges."</p></blockquote>
One must accurately pinpoint information in order to get it. I accept the hon. Gentleman's comments about that. There is a huge range of matters. However, I did not want to be accused of wasting the Committee's time and I thought that the Committee would accept that. This goes back to earlier comments where we were in agreement that decisions could only be based on good information, but Strathclyde admits that it does not have the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin to understand the hon. Member's position a bit more. However, the sort of information that the hon. Gentleman suggests school boards should obtain under the amendment is the sort of information that they should have had before clause 16 was enacted. That was the only point that I was making. Perhaps it should have come earlier. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) spoke about this. The amendment could be relevant only to subsection (3), not subsection (4). As I pointed out in an intervention the school board will surely not ask the education authority whether it is a primary or secondary school. That demonstrates a lack of confidence in school boards. That is why I thought the amendment technically unsound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood has tabled an amendment in which he proposes to replace
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the school board think fit"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (3)(e)(ii) with
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the Secretary of State shall prescribe by regulations".</p></blockquote>
I am surprised at that. He suggests removing powers from schools boards and giving them to the Secretary of State which seems contrary to his philosophy. He appears to disagree with me. Perhaps he whould like to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously you would not want me to anticipate the debate on amendment No. 85, Mr. Martin, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that that amendment came from the Scottish Consumer Council and that all hon. Members have received it. I tabled it because it contained a point that should be put to the Minister. As I have already said to the hon. Member for Western Isles, after what the Minister has said, I shall not press my amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it would be wrong to debate an amendment that is not before us. But the hon. Gentleman appeared to suggest to the hon. Member for Tayside, North that one amendment made the other more acceptable. I do not believe that that is so, and I still find it surprising that a Conservative Member should wish to withdraw powers from a school board and invest them in the Secretary of State. Perhaps I should not be surprised. The thrust of the Bill is to centralise power in the hands of the Secretary of State and remove local power. Perhaps the amendment is in keeping with the rest of the Bill, betraying its true underlying agenda and philosophy. Perhaps we have smoked out a wee bit of that philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the explanation from the hon. Member for Tayside, North of what he is trying to do, but I still find the amendment wrong. It is technically wrong. Also, it would force an open-ended commitment on education authorities. Not many people will want to know about education provision in China or West Germany, but the theoretical possibility remains, and the hon. Gentleman must accept that there is an open-ended commitment. The Opposition will oppose the amendment, but I expect that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the amendment was on the amendment paper last week 1 had no hesitation in deciding that it would be right to support my hon. Friend. But a new situation has arisen. I am prepared to concede that if, in a short time—possibly before the end of the Committee stage—we have statements from the chairmen of all other regional authorities along the lines of the statement in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> from our friend Sir Charles, my hon. Friend's amendment could prove unnecessary. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) asked the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) a question for the simple reason that, like the rest of us, he read this morning's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> and saw the dilemma for the leadership of the Labour party. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And the dilemma for the leadership was: how could it answer any new whiz-bang idea that Michael Forsyth, the Scottish education minister, would launch at the pubilc without appearing to Labour councillors to be copying the man it accused of ruining education?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The answer revealed yesterday was simple and elegant: Forsyth was a sneak-thief: any worthwhile idea like school boards or developments in post-compulsory education he had stolen from Strathclyde and dressed in Tory clothes. That claim, says Charles Gray, the council's leader, is supported by department documents, but whether it will convince the council and staff unions is another matter."</p></blockquote>
We must be fair to that eminent councillor, Charlie Gray—"Sir Charles" rolls off the tongue much better. He says that he has been banging his head against a brick wall for the past five years, and we see before us on the Opposition Benches the brick wall with which he has had to contend. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden does a lot better in our afternoon sittings. In the mornings when we raise matters for him to deal with he is always caught with his trousers down and has to wait hours before he gets his orders on how to reply. We had an example of that last Tuesday, and I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I have replied in detail to Mrs. Lamont's letter, with a copy to the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington). I also sent Mrs. Lamont a copy of the extract from the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of last week's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it also be noted that the official Labour party spokesman refused to comment, when I gave him an option to do so, on whether he approved Strathclyde's proposals to allow schools to "handle their own budgets"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is significant, and I suppose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have a group of amendments before us, and that is what must be debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin, but my case is simply that the amendments are no longer necessary, provided that we have from all the other regional councils statements similar to that by the leader of Strathclyde council. On that basis, I think that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
Friend. Does he agree that, before my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) can withdraw his amendment—in effect, the Government would withdraw their amendment, too—it is necessary to have not only statements from the other education authorities but a reasonable assurance that those statements will be implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that until that occurs—we can take on trust the statement from Strathclyde regional chairman, as much work has been carried out on the study for some time—it would be right for my hon. Friend the Minister to consider bringing forward on Report some of the provisions that have been outlined in the amendment. However, we must be fair to those in charge of education in Scotland. They recognise the wind of change that is blowing. We may debate whether my hon. Friend the Minister or our friend Sir Charles is blowing that wind of change the fastest. They are running together very fast. Who is going to beat the other? Opposition Members are nowhere in the race, and it is merely a question of who gets to the finishing post first—Sir Charles or my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fascinating morning. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), I started by believing that the amendments were necessary. However, that was before we heard about the policy developments which have unfolded before us. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) made an interesting, honest and fair contribution in which he made it perfectly clear that he thought that school boards should have financial delegation of budgets, and he saw nothing wrong with that. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see why my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North would want to press his amendment too far. If we can be confident that the view that has been expressed by the hon. Member for Dumbarton and by councillor Gray reflects the policy of the Labour party, the belt and braces approach for which my hon. Friend is arguing may be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is difficult to know what is going to happen between now and 4.30. Will there be a call to another member of the Labour party or to the EIS which will create a change in the Opposition Front Bench? I cannot recall an occasion in Committee on which a leading figure in the Labour party put forward a policy proposal and the Front Bench spokesman for the Labour part refused to rise, despite repeated invitations, to say whether he supported him. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) if he would like to tell the Committee whether he supports the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had light entertainment from the libertarian wing and a general knockabout at the expense of Strathclyde. I am willing to put on the record at the start of the debate on the next series of amendments my position on this issue. If Conservative Members want a definitive position, that is what they will get—if we can move on. The comments that have been made are gearmane to the wide range of amendments that will affect

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. This is a matter of vital concern. We are all aware of newspaper deadlines. Can we sit through lunch so that the amendments can be debated quickly and the hon. Gentleman can make his views known to the press? I shall do without lunch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly not do without lunch. The rules state clearly that we stop at 1 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may draw your attention to a provision in the Standing Orders, Mr. Martin, which enables the Committee to sit until 1.15 pm at your discretion if there is the possibility of disposing of an argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to educate hon. Members on Committee procedure. A Committee sits after 1 pm only to dispense with business relating to the Bill, to which we must now return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brick wall has been replaced by a wall of silence. I feel that I am battering my head against a wall of silence, although the hon. Member for Dumbarton. East has again proved to be courageous. Of course, he has been through his reselection process, so I have no qualms about drawing his courage to the Committee's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot accuse me of being silent during the Committee's proceedings. The proposals described in today's press deal with the devolution of power within the Strathclyde region. The School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 has resulted in a conflict between school boards and head teachers over the purchase of books and equipment and the appointment of staff. The Strathclyde proposal is entirely different from that of the previous Bill or this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The region supports the idea of school boards, and … should go further than current Government policy, and invest even greater power in the boards."</p></blockquote>
It also states that Charles Gray believes that

to the boards, they will have to have a great deal of information that they would not otherwise have had. It is in that context that the extent to which education authorities will delegate substantial powers is relevant. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to slip away from the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East is finding things difficult this morning. I am not surprised. I do not envy his position today as he has to argue for parental majorities, having argued against them when we debated school boards. There is a considerable movement in his party's policy on providing information and powers to school boards. It seems that the new realism might not be wholly endorsed by the Labour party, although it might be at 4.30 am. That is why it might not be wise for me to withdraw either the Government amendment, which ensures the availability of financial cover, or my commitment to come back with proposals. In considering the proposals that the Government will table on Report, I shall take account of the developing policy formulation that is now going on among the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) asked about the limits on information to be provided to school boards. He asked whether they would have to be given information about what was happening in other parts of the world. The School Boards (Scotland) Act includes a clear duty on the education authority to provide information on any aspect of the running and organisation of the school. So the requirement is already broadly based. My hon. Friend seeks an assurance that the same obligation should apply to preparing proposals for self-governing status, and I have given that undertaking. The education authority is not under an obligation to give information that it does not have or information that should remain confidential. The principle that concerns my hon. Friend has already been established in the School Boards (Scotland) Act, which now enjoys such widespread support across the political divide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East was keen to press me on the extent of the information that would be required by school boards in lining up the proposals. It would be quite limited. But the hon. Gentleman misses the point of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, who wants to ensure that there is a proper spirit of co-operation, that the board be given the help and support that it needs by the head teacher and by the education authority, and that the preparation of proposals should not be frustrated out of a desire to slow down the process or to make it more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). In this new enlightened climate it may be unfair to authorities such as Strathclyde to assume that it would behave in such a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
way. None the less, my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North is right to try to ensure that the legislation contains a belt and braces approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board will want information on matters such as staffing policy, the state of buildings, pupil roll projections, the precise definition of the catchment area, and so on. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) rightly pointed out that such matters should be given consideration before the ballot takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Labour party's policy in Strathclyde, I should have thought that Opposition Members would support the Government amendment if they believe that the Strathclyde view will not prevail. If. however, they think that the Strathclyde view will prevail and that there will be substantial delegation, they may feel unable to support the amendment on the basis that it will not be necessary. But, in the absence of any speech from the Front-Bench spokesman outlining the Opposition's views, it is difficult to know what line they should take. It is regrettable that we are told that we shall not be given an explanation until we move on to the next amendment, which deals with admissions policy and has nothing to do with information or with Srathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have been extremely tolerant this morning, Mr. Martin, but even your tolerance would be exceeded if an hon. Member tried to make a speech outlining the position on the Strathclyde proposals in a group of amendments concerned with admission policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the praise for the Strathclyde view, should the Committee attribute any importance to the recent appearance of the Patronage Secretary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain what to make of that: no doubt members of the Committee will draw their own conclusions. In fairness to the Committee, it is the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) who has been telling Scotland that it is important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wind up and give me a chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that I should wind up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unusual when members of a Committee make recommendations on honours and then the Whip is quickly in close consultation with the Patrongage Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that between now and 4.30 pm the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will give the leader of Strathclyde regional council a full account of the gratitude of Opposition Members regarding the proposals that he published yesterday. From a sedentary position, the hon. Gentleman is saying that if I wind up now, he will explain his party's position. On that basis, I shall finish
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
speaking, commending the Government amendment to the Committee and asking my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North to withdraw his. I hope that the hon. Member for Fife, Central will now explain the Opposition's position, because that is crucial to how members of the Committee view the Government amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks about my amendment for the Government's support of the principle behind it. I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend will bring forward an amendment to deal with that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate. If nothing else, we have flushed out many things. It has been useful to know Strathclyde regional council's position on information. It is on record that the council does not know what is going on in its schools. Therefore, an amendment such as mine will have the effect that I have always said the Bill will have. The Bill will not necessarily mean that every Scottish school will pursue the policies in the amendment. Schools might not want to opt out and might be prepared to accept the regional authority if it were to behave in the way that Strathclyde intends to behave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also flushed out that the Opposition are again at sixes and sevens. Will they consult the EIS or the STUC? The president of the STUC knows something about U-turns. He accuses me and my hon. Friends of doing U-turns and, further, he accuses me of being an unprincipled liar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What did he say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the report in the press this morning. He accuses me of that because I apparently did not stand for election on a platform of supporting self-governing schools—opting out, as it is known colloquially. I have news for him and others—I did stand on such a platform. I have made clear my views to my constituents and to the Committee. The Bill will make local authorities more responsive to the wishes of local people. That is evident already from Strathclyde's proposals—put forward when the Bill has made only part of its progress through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even after this long debate, the Opposition have no view. They have not told the Committee where they stand on the amendment or of their views on Councillor Gray's statement. The amendment is about information and the duties of head teachers. Anyone reading the press releases this morning can appreciate clearly that Strathclyde admits that it does not have the information. It spends almost £1,000 million on education, but it does not know what is going on. Do the Opposition take their orders from the EIS or the STUC, and have they consulted anyone? Is the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) the only Opposition Member prepared to give constructive views? I hope that I am not damning him by saying that. He has much to contribute from his background and experience, as does the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). The Committee welcomes that, but there is no doubt that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman has left me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
in the position where I cannot give my view on whether I should withdraw the amendment. I have not heard what the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the last 10 minutes of prime time for the press to state the Opposition's official view not directly on the amendment, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will withdraw, but on newspaper articles about Strathclyde regional council? They have a bearing on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly welcome the sign that Strathclyde regional council is considering the implementation of the study made by Inlogov—a reputable organisation. Later this afternoon, I shall meet the director of Strathclyde's education department, and we shall meet the leader of the council and the chairman of the education committee, Mr. Malcolm Green, later this week. Then, I shall receive a copy of the report and more details about it. I shall listen to the views expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Setting aside the party knockabout, hon. Members will appreciate that Strathclyde has problems of size and structure. Indeed, both the Labour and Conservative parties are considering another reorganisation of local government that will deal with those problems. Strathclyde is making an ambitious attempt to tackle some of the difficulties and has spent money on them. I believe that the money was well-spent. At a press conference, the leader of the council and the director of education have put their comments on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I especially welcome the proposals for decentralisation of education policy away from the headquarers of the council and to the areas. Both the Government and Opposition know that there is a major difficulty with the scale of the authority. I have never attacked Strathclyde councillors or their policies because they were not responsible for the size of the authority. That was decided by this House under a Conservative Government. It is unfair always to dwell on the excesses of the council because of those problems of scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newspaper reports on the issues of school boards are encouraging. We support school boards as a front line of defence against the Bill. We may not agree with Councillor Gray's personal views, as reported in the press, but he has at least had the courage to say "Yes, improvements are needed in Strathclyde". Some ideas have been included in up to four education Bills. However, he has now expressed positive views of where he thinks Strathclyde schools should go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall carry on because it is an excellent time to express my views. I shall allow the Minister to intervene when I have made this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the thrust of the Government's knockabout today and their desire to show dissent in the Opposition. Strathclyde is, as one newspaper suggested, the largest education authority in Europe. It has had the courage to make proposals after facing
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
the Government's earlier wrath and in the knowledge that Conservative Members would gleefully wish to exploit the change of policy in Committee. However, it is not worthwhile to belittle the change that has occurred. Like Conservative Members, I warmly welcome the proposals. The Government cannot speak for the EIS or other organisations in Scotland that they do not favour because the Government do not communicate with anyone. They are not the listening party, whereas we consult many organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear about this matter because it is important for the amendment, which is about information. The hon. Gentleman said that he welcomes the proposals. Does he welcome financial delegation to schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had distinguished between decentralisation and the structural problems of the centre. Comments by the director of education and Councillor Gray may not be statements of policy but are now on the record as emanating from Councillor Gray. I do not want to comment on whether school boards should be allowed to develop and have ceiling powers that were massively rejected by other sections of the Scottish community. That is a point for Councillor Charles Gray; he is the leader of the council. It would be impertinent for the Government or the Opposition to tell a major council what it should do and what comments it should make to the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde has had major problems for many years because of the size of the authority. Everyone in Scotland would accept the wisdom of a debate not only in Strathclyde house but throughout Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he would make his party's position clear, but he has not commented on the central proposals in the report. Are we clear that the Labour party's policy is clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit of mischievous tautology. We shall not give a party response to an issue that emerges from a council. That would be ludicrous. I shall not dwell further on the hon. Gentleman's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting forward a constructive view of Strathclyde's problems and its response to them. The Government can ask for no more from the Opposition. A report clearly exists and I hope that the Minister will call for a copy of it, as we shall. It would be unproductive to comment on remarks attributed to councillors and directors at a press conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this general political knockabout will not detract from the serious initiative of Strathclyde regional council for parents and for the children who attend the schools and colleges throughout the region. I do not accept that our views compromise its position on school boards. But if the Government use those comments in the press to justify the Bill, that will be seen for what it is—a charade. Nothing in the press reports that I have read suggests that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
Councillor Charles Gray or Frank Pignatelli support any provision of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a distinction between a council developing ideas about school boards and the passionate hatred within Strathclyde of the measures for self-governing status. I am grateful to the Government for giving me the opportunity to put on record my positive and warm personal comments on the activities within Strathclyde regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A moment ago the hon. Gentleman said that it would be impertinent to make such comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move on. I do not associate the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) with the libertarian Right. He has not followed the drift of my remarks which praised Strathclyde but did not give advice on what should be done. The proposals are about autonomy and the Bill is about centralisation. We welcome an authority that wants to decentralise services for half of Scotland and provide greater accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
