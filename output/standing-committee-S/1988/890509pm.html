No. 313, in page 43, line 31, leave out "tests" and insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>"assessment materials for primary education".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the use of tests in schools. The Minister may look surprised, but we have always supported the use of tests for their proper purpose of diagnostic assessment. Tests are necessary to give teachers and parents a better understanding of the needs and progress of an individual child. They also give teachers an idea of the quality of their teaching and of the materials and methods that they use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intended introduction of national testing at primary 4 and primary 7 will not do that. It will separate pupils in order of rank. Results will be published and comparisons between schools will be made. It will be a return to the old qualy system, where young people sat a qualifying exam at 11 years of age and were then separated into different schools. The Government regard that as a supposed golden age, but in Scotland it was a golden age when 80 per cent. of pupils failed and only 20 per cent. passed. The Government's proposed national testing scheme will be even more divisive. Pupils will be labelled as failures at the ripe old age of nine, when any form of selection automatically implies a form of rejection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals on national testing have attracted more criticism than any other in the Bill. National testing will undermine the equality
	<span class='label label-info column'>1324</span>
of opportunity that has been developed in Scottish primary and secondary schools over the years. We said that the School Boards (Scotland) Bill would result in a political battleground for each school. In the same way, national testing will pit school against school and teacher against teacher. That is the fundamental reason why we oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were many responses to the Government's proposals on curriculum and assessment of November 1982. The Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum, which advises the Secretary of State for Scotland, gave its response, as did local authorities. I presume that Strathclyde, which has figured in all our debates so far, also responded. The Church of Scotland, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, the Scottish Consumer Council, the EIS and COSLA, all gave their response. The Minister received a letter from the Rev. Alasdair Morton, which addressed the issue of testing. He wrote that the Church of Scotland recognised that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whereas testing in primary schools is universal and part of a teacher's responsibility, and whereas diagnostic testing is to be welcomed as being in the good interests of the child, the development of any system of standardised national testing which is normative will inevitably lead to a change in attitude to tests by pupils, teachers and parents, that is likely to be detrimental to the interests of the child."</p></blockquote>
What is the educational justification for the testing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>The Scotsman</i> stated in one of its leaders that there was no genuine attempt to reach a consensus about a programme of improvement in the Bill. Those remarks are especially appropriate to national testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is interested in the anxieties of the Rev. Alasdair Morton and his education committee about testing. But he and his chums in the Kirk should be more anxious about the inspector of schools' report, which states that only half of the primary schools and 60 per cent. of secondary schools have proper religious education. The Church is certain about testing, and yet uncertain about its role in teaching religious education in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The letter that I received from the Rev. Alasdair Morton contained a booklet entitled, "Christian Teaching in Education". It was sent to every member of the Committee, so it is obvious that the Church is interested in religious education in schools. It combines its criticisms of the Bill with a free booklet on Christian Teaching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman read the booklet? It acknowledges that we live in a secular society and that the Church must accommodate itself to that. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) seems to envisage a more campaigning role for the Church in religious education in schools. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave the Minister to discuss those issues with the Church of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has also received a response about testing from the Scottish Consultative Council on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1325</span>
Curriculum. It advises the Secretary of State on curricular matters, and is anxious that the universal desire for consistent standards should not lead to the imposition on every school of a uniform and inflexible system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum does not oppose testing in principle, but has difficulty in accepting the Government's proposals for national testing. It fears that the climate created by such testing could damage young children's attitudes to learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By introducing national testing, the Minister is reintroducing fear into the classroom. The Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum suggests that the Government's objective of establishing national indicators of performance could be met more effectively by regular monitoring on the basis of sampling, and these criterion-reference assessments would be administered by class teachers on a diagnostic and formative basis as the normal part of the teaching and learning process and therefore would not be confined to primary 4 and 7. The tests will distort the curriculum, and make the transition between the primary and secondary level much more difficult. The consultative council also looked forward to a fuller statement of the Government's views on education at the primary and secondary interface.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas reference has been made to testing at primary 4 and primary 7, very little has been said about that important interface. Like the consultative council, I am sad to note the Government's rejection of the same council's 10 to 14 report, which sought to promote more harmonious relations between primary and secondary schools. I believe that the primary 4 and 7 tests will lead to a dichotomy between the curricula of primary and secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the Government's case has yet to be developed and I hope that the Minister will deal with these important issues. For example, the definition and development of curriculum areas for five to 14-year-olds is essentially in terms of subjects and contents, but those terms are used very narrowly by the Government that rigid statements of content to be covered and objectives to be achieved could come to be established as national norms or standards if these are related to ages or specific stages. The Minister well knows that when children first enter primary schools, there can be as much as 11 or 12 months' difference in learning development between individual children. That makes the need for diagnostic assessment even greater, because children originate from very different backgrounds: some are backward due to unfortunate circumstances; others are privileged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee exactly what he means by diagnostic testing? Will he also explain the distinction between diagnostic and normative testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Diagnostic testing is to determine the educational level of a child, and to establish what
	<span class='label label-info column'>1326</span>
methods, materials and resources are available to develop the child's potential. The Opposition fear that with national testing, the Minister is setting a specific standard and a hurdle for each child to jump at the appropriate age. Differences in knowledge and attainment at early ages are wide. The Cockcroft report showed that at the age of 11, children had a spread of ability of between two and three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my amazement that at this stage of the Bill's proceedings, the Minister has to ask about the difference between diagnostic and normative testing? Have we been arguing at cross-purposes all along? Perhaps if the Minister understood the Opposition's anxieties about testing, he would agree with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. I suspect, however, that the Minister was not being altruistic when he put that question to me. He smiled and his shoulders jumped up and down like those of the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath), but the Minister was probably trying to catch me out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was sidetracked by the hon. Minister for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), but will he answer my question? He has explained what he means by diagnostic testing, but I asked him also to explain the difference between diagnostic and normative testing and how it relates to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Normative testing relates to the hurdle that children have to jump by passing exams. It is inappropriate because of the spread of learning ability among children of the same age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs Fyfe) may have made a valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) does not seem to be opposed to what we propose. While the tests will be normative, they will define levels of attainment for the relevant subjects, by which children's progress can be judged. The tests are not the hurdles or barriers that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not say what he meant by diagnostic tests. They are usually designed to establish the causes of learning difficulties, such as with mathematical problems. They are much more intensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will increasing the testing be contingent on whether the children are to be tested against their previous performance so that they can make their way to another stage? It is individualised assessment. The proposed national tests are not oriented towards the whole range of pupils' abilities. Others have expressed the same worry because they believe that the tests are a departure from the philosophy and practice of Scottish education. It would also be a departure from the HMI reports
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1327</span>
over the years, especially those on primary 4 and primary 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worry was also expressed in the inspector's report on primary education in the 1980s, and in the reports on 10 to 14-year olds. I note also the Strathclyde S1-S2 report of five or six years ago,— which examined the work being done in primary and secondary schools and called for more coherence in the interchange between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are going ahead with their plans to introduce nationally defined tests in maths and English in primary 4 and primary 7, despite their almost universal rejection by Scottish educationists. The Government's approach is ideological and philosophical, and contains no pragmatism. If there were any pragmatism, the Government would seek a consensus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hurry the hon. Gentleman on the issue of tests, but has he examined the situation in Fife, which the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has rightly endorsed enthusiastically? The teachers' introduction to the mathematics tests devised by Fife education authority, which are used at primary 5, says that the tests have been devised
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide information as to which pupils have achieved a certain specified level of mastery of various skills in number and shape."</p></blockquote>
Is that not similar to the sort of tests that the hon. Gentleman says that he opposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have to study the Fife proposals in more detail before agreeing with the Minister, but there is a common language, in that we want each child to attain certain objectives. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) can add something to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman describe a test, designed to show which pupils have achieved a certain specified level—we could call it a hurdle— of mastery of various skills in number and shape, as diagnostic or normative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not say for certain at the moment. Where are the tests coming from—from an individual teacher in a school or from a bank of tests, as is envisaged in the Bill, in the Scottish Examination Board, from which teachers have to fish out tests? I should not describe the latter as diagnostic testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate is useful. If the hon. Gentleman would like to see examples of the tests, there are examples of those set in Fife. There are tests in mathematics and addition, with which we are all familiar. However, I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's use of language. He says that he is in favour of diagnostic tests, but against normative tests. The teachers' introduction to the mathematics test set by Fife states that the purpose of the test is to show
	<br><blockquote><p>"which pupils have achieved a certain specified level of mastery of various skills in number and shape."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman define that type of test as diagnostic or normative? If he calls it diagnostic,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1328</span>
there is no disagreement between us. The tests used there and the tests that we propose are similar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the tests are diagnostic or normative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder how many other Committee members are failing to hear the Minister. We have nothing against the idea of teachers laying down certain criteria. However, we are against the Scottish Examination Board setting tests for people to introduce to their school. That national testing is a simple hurdle for people to jump across, and we are against it because it does not take the individual child's background into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is test material in mathematics, produced by the education authority. It has questions such as, "What is the value of three in the number 739? Circle the correct answer," and "How many units could I make altogether from 15 tens?" and so on, which are designed to establish what level of attainment the child has reached. How is that different from testing material being provided centrally, rather than by the education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister trying to say that he is happy with that? If he is, why is the clause included in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Fife, schools are testing in primary 1, primary 3, primary 5 and primary 7. In Central region, it was only with the support of the Scottish National party that the Labour party was able to maintain its policy of testing, after an Educational Institute of Scotland member tried to root it out. It is not universal in Scotland, and Fife is one of the progressive authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Borders has a standardised reading test at primary 5, and Grampian has standardised mathematics and reading tests at primary 2 and 3. Fife has a primary 1 test and a primary 3 screening test in maths and language. Therefore, much testing is going on. The Minister would be better advised if he went round the authorities, saw what was happening and then built on the assessment procedures already present instead of knocking the whole house down and starting again with a simple prescriptive test for the whole of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the essential difference between Fife's programme and the type of programme suggested by the Minister is that, first, there is no standardised bank of tests? There is no centralised, national advice and there are no attainment targets on a national scale. That is the essential difference between the national component in the Government's proposals that we are so much against and the reality in Fife where the child-centred approach is diagnostic in the sense that it seeks to look at difficulties experienced so that appropriate action can be taken. Does my hon. Friend not agree
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1329</span>
that that is an exemplary way forward and one that even the Minister has praised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I or do I not agree with the Minister? The Minister is shaking his head vigorously. Does he want to intervene again? Apparently not. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) for his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The depressing truth is that the assessment proposals do not arise from any real need identified by Her Majesty's inspectors, by teachers or parents, but are a consequence of the Government's belief in the desirability of instilling in children the competitive ethic. In the Government's view they have the added benefit of reversing pressure on the teaching profession whom the Government hold responsible for much of society's ills. The Minister clearly welcomes the idea that comparisons between schools will be possible on the basis of assessment results. We will have assessment results in primary 4 and primary 7, which can then be used for entry into secondary schools. What is there to stop a head teacher of a secondary school asking every parent what his or her child attained at the primary 7 level? The old qualy system will be back with a bang starting in primary 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are at pains to stress the diagnostic value of the tests, but they have made no attempt to refute the argument put forward by almost anyone with any knowledge of the subject that age-related criteria are simply inappropriate for this purpose. I mentioned the Cockcroft report earlier. It suggests that there is as much as a seven-year spread within the mathematical attainments of 11-year-olds. If that is so, how can one possibly have national testing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national standards which the tests hope to embody are bound to be arbitrary and unrelated to the needs of the individual child. Diagnostic assessment is therefore needed. Tests will fail to motivate the high fliers and will reintroduce fear into the classrooms. That has been the experience in other countries which have introduced similar systems of assessment. At a conference at the Polytechnic of North London last year a New York teacher stated that in New York state the test scores followed the children like an albatross. That will be replicated in Scotland. That teacher said that most of his colleagues agreed that the time spent preparing and administering the tests could be more profitably spent on teaching. Any teacher knows that testing is an indispensible adjunct to teaching, but it must be positive and it must be motivating. If anything, over the past 15 years in Scotland, we have learnt that lesson. To achieve that, assessment must discover how much learning has taken place at the end of a unit of teaching and not at a particular stage in a pupil's career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document on assessment produced by the Scottish Office tries to allay fears on that score by saying that national tests will complement the continuous assessment which is undertaken in schools. That makes nonsense of its claim that the tests will have diagnostic value. The timescale for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1330</span>
implementing the proposals rules out even the faintest possibility of devising assessment instruments with any sensitivity or complexity. During the debates on the Education Reform Act 1988 it was mentioned that the Centre for Educational Studies in Kings College, London presented a report to the Secretary of State for Education and Science which caused considerable embarrassment to Ministers because it revealed that it would take at least nine years to develop an effective national system of assessment. The Government were proposing to examine reading, writing and ciphering without children knowing how to read, write and cipher. We are not questioning the integrity of the teaching profession. There will undoubtedly be pressure on it to accept a narrower focus in their teaching.

When Professor Higginson of Southampton university was advising the Secretary of State for Education and Science on A-levels, I remeber that he wanted a broader curriculum in England and Wales. We are now going back to a narrower curriculum, replicating the system of England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall from the report that the estimate of the timescale for implementation was based on the testing being introduced in mathematics on a topic-by-topic basis. That was a questionable judgment which would have resulted in the timescale being extended. He will also recall that since then, Professor Black's report has been able to take full account of those findings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point of difference between us.

To sum up, in valuing the results achieved by a school the Government say that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"will give due regard to the school context, including the circumstances under which schools work".</p></blockquote>
That is a general phrase and the Government need to flesh it out. The lack of specifics leads one to suspect that they have in mind some crude handicapping system in which results are weighted according to catchment area, age of building, number of one-parent families and so on. The problem is that the extra-curricular factors affecting the educational process are potentially infinite, which is why no one has yet managed to identify a satisfactory formula for the comparison of school performances. The Government have had responses from the Scottish Council for Research in Education and others, yet they have given no satisfactory responses on those points. Until they come clean on that, we have every right to say with conviction that national testing will be nothing other than a retrograde step. It will reintroduce the qualy with a bang and take us back to Victorian times. If the Government want their amendment to be considered more seriously, they will have to come up with genuine arguments before we can even start to be convinced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

a debate because this is an important aspect of the Bill. However, having listened for the past 32 minutes, I must confess that I am more confused than I was when I read the amendment and listened to the first three minutes of the speech of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall). I fear that we are becoming involved in a debate about words— diagnostic against normative—and getting bogged down in other such matters without getting to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the views that the hon. Gentleman expressed in the first part of his speech. We must ensure that the tests do not become an end in themselves; that is the one point that worries me. When he said that he was not against testing, I thought that we were going to have a slightly more constructive speech that we actually had. I am certainly not against testing. Many of my teacher friends, and even more parents, welcome testing, particularly at certain stages of a child's school career, since it helps parents better to understand what progress their child is making. I understand that the purpose behind my hon. Friend's proposal is to obtain a better measure of critical stages of a child's progress in primary schools, particularly in basic numeracy and literacy. It is important to have tests at particular stages, and it is helpful for parents to know how their child is progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not get involved with words such as diagnostic and normative. I am concerned that the results of those tests will affect a pupil's immediate future and the rest of his career. Tests are one of many aids used by teachers to mark and map the progress of a pupil. I strongly support continuous assessment through a pupil's career in school. Tests should be an element in the programme of assessment to which every child is rightly subject, but I wholly oppose a return to the 11-plus in England and Wales and the 12-plus in Scotland. Under that system, a child's future school career was decided simply on the results of one test. It would be retrograde to return to a system whereby the result of a test was the only deciding factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look to my hon. Friend the Minister to reassure me that the tests provided in the Bill will be used not in such a way as to have a dramatic effect on a child's future, but simply as one of many tools in the general assessment of a child's progress. Tests should be one small mark showing what stage a child has reached in a subject. They must be part of a wider, on-going process. The critical stages of a child's career—in the watersheds, such as moving from primary into secondary school—should not be decided by testing but by general assessment, of which testing is only one small part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is what the hon. Gentleman the Member for Dumbarton is driving at, although I cannot follow his use of technical terms. I hope that the Minister will accept that my judgment is correct and assure me that these tests will not be used as an end in themselves.

There are benefits from testing and we should make use of those benefits in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

knockabouts. The prepetrators of such knockabouts are absent because they have little to contribute to this subject. We are striving towards a fuller understanding of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one objects to children being tested. On Second Reading Conservative Members seemed to think that the Opposition were opposed to testing. No one with children's interests at heart is opposed to testing. We are agruing about the type of testing. Perhaps the jargon that we have used from the world of education has created some difficulty. The hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) remarked with engaging frankness that it is simply words to him. If teachers have failed to express what the problem is, that is sad and perhaps we can recover some ground today. I shall try to explain the position as clearly as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a normative test is set, there is a level of attainment above which is a pass and below which is a fail. The level may be set at the average that can be expected for a child in that subject. Alternatively, any other norm could be set, for example one which two thirds of children can pass or one which only one tenth can pass. When a teacher sets a norm, he or she sets a level to assess failure or success, whereas diagnostic testing is aimed at assessing a child's progress against its previous attainment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to develop that essential difference a little further. In a mixed ability class, in which pupils can range from barely literate to potential doctorate students, to say that some pupils have done badly in a normative test does not say much. It merely enforces a sense of failure. Even if the test is not used, as the Minister promised, to place children in a rank order or to select them for secondary schools, the fact that the teacher and the parents know that the child did badly against the national norm will not help children whose attainment is low. Teachers who are striving to improve a child's performance will not be helped by knowing that the child is well below the national norm. Every effort should be made to strive to improve what children have already attained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if this sounds like semantics, but the definitions of normative and diagnostic testing are important, if only so that we all know what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady's definition of normative testing, except that we are proposing not a pass or fail level but a band of levels of attainment. As the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said, there will be a wide gap between the levels of children starting school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Lady's definition of diagnostic testing. Once it is established that a child has difficulty in doing something, diagnostic testing sets out to establish precisely why he cannot do it so that corrective action can be taken. The hon. Lady nods in agreement. Diagnostic testing is distinct from defining levels of attainment in particular subjects on the basis of a continuum, as Fife education authority does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether we are discussing a norm above which is pass and below which is a fail or banding, if a child becomes aware that he or she has fallen into one of the bottom bands, my point still pertains: what will that do to achieve any improvement in the child's future performance? Children cannot be told that they did not fail but merely fell into the bottom band. That is hardly constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady seems to be saying that she is in favour of diagnostic testing but against normative testing, because children may feel a sense of failure if they are in a lower band. I do not accept her argument about a sense of failure, but on that basis why should children not feel a sense of failure if they are taken for diagnostic testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will let me develop my argument, I shall gladly tell him. The Minister's definition of diagnostic testing was related to failure. I accept that, because it is part of what diagnostic testing is about. It is designed largely to help children who have failed to attain the standard of which they are capable and to detect where the problems lie so that they can be overcome, perhaps by offering different material, or by suggesting another approach for teaching a subject. That is where teaching skills come in. They are used to identify what went wrong and what needs to be done to help children overcome their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Diagnostic testing has wider implications than that. It also helps children who are already doing well to do even better. It assesses their present level of attainment and finds out what they could attain. It is about overcoming difficulty and helping them to do better, whether they show great or poor ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes, children are initially poor in a subject, but once they have overcome a block they raise their heads and grasp the subject well. I know that from experience. I was totally at a loss in my university economics class until it all suddently came together. I failed the exams at Christmas but got 90 per cent. in the summer exams. Students overcome blocks that hold them back 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not know why the Minister is laughing. I wonder whether he got a pass in economics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have experience of overcoming difficulties and going on to make improvements. Diagnostic testing is about overcoming difficulties and helping children to do better. It does not profit a child to be told, "You are much worse than the national average in arithmetic, English or history."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister proffered some test material and asked whether it was a diagnostic or a normative test. I do not want to be combative or nasty, but that shows that the Minister does not understand what we have been discussing because that test, and any other like it, could be used for either purpose. It could be used in a normative exam to identify children as being in certain bands if they do, or do not, achieve a specific mark, or it could be used to test a child's performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1334</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady criticised me. On the objectives that were set, I asked whether the hon. Member for Dumbarton considered the tests normative or diagnostic. In the introduction to the Fife tests, comparisons are made between tests:
	<br><blockquote><p>"each test is standardised by age to a normal distribution of mean 100 and standard deviation 15. In such a distribution 16 per cent. of all pupils will score less than 85, 68 per cent. will score between 85 and 115, and 16 per cent. will score above 115."</p></blockquote>
That is what the hon. Member for Dumbarton described as not being standardised tests and not being normative, but diagnostic, tests. If the hon. Lady believes that too, we all believe the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat what I said earlier. I have not had a close look at the tests that the Minister has, but I accept the general principle that he has described. A particular set of tests can be used to determine which band a child falls into. So can any test. The same test can also be used in mathematical proficiency to determine a pupil's progress. Such a test may be competely inappropriate for some pupils because they have not reached that level of attainment. To confront a child with a paper which he or she cannot understand would create a feeling of defeat, of incapacity and of being one of life's failures. A child would believe that it was pointless to try to learn. That is why we oppose normative testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That hits the nub of the problem. Earlier, the Minister made an intervention on the maths testing in primary 5 in Fife. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill pointed out, those tests are optional and are not taken from nationalised standard item banks. The assessment materials are prepared by a representative from the Northern College of Education and an internal adviser from within the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An essential distinction that has not yet been made is that we are discussing not just how the test is made, but what is used in the test and how the tests are used in the child's education, whether remedial or performed against a national standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and hope that it clarifies the issue for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To confront a child with a national test, much of which he or she cannot understand, let alone answer, is to do nothing for that child's education. If the test does not try to improve the child's educational attainment, to place the child in rank order, or to qualify him or her for secondary school, what is its purpose? Nothing at all is being done to help children to improve if they are faced with a test with which they cannot cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue for diagnostic testing because it is fitted to the child's current level of attainment and stretches the child a little more so that he or she can achieve. One of the joys of teaching is to help children to improve. In spite of all the difficulties, people become teachers because they love helping children to improve on previous performances. That is what people get out of teaching and such a strong
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1335</span>
motivating factor keeps them going. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will agree readily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The testing that we favour would be able to help a child with a low attainment level to push for a bit more. The child would gain in confidence from having reached a higher level of attainment. That attainment might be nothing to a more able child who surpassed it long before, but rather than constantly make children feel failures, we want them to attain what they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the days of the qualy, the categories were SI23 or J123 and a J3 was a really hopeless failure. It made children feel that they could never achieve anything at school. They felt that they were being told that academic teaching was not for them. At that early age, they were turned into the future hewers of wood and drawers of water. The children who got S1s were told that they were the brightest and best and had a blossoming future. If one wants children to attain the best that they can, one does not make them failures at the age of 11, in primary 4, or in primary 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the thrust of our argument. We want what the teachers want—testing that helps children to improve and which does not write them off at an early age or make them feel that schooling is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate because this is one of the most important parts of the Bill. I am glad that differences of opinion have been aired, but those differences are philosophical. We cannot agree on certain parts of the debate. I am not ashamed to say that I fully support the principles and practice of testing. It is an essential part of the educative process and I do not know how progress can be made without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to add to the definitions of normative and diagnostic testing but, as I understand it, normative testing is designed to measure the achievement of pupils—in other words, to discover what they can do at any stage of the learning process—and diagnostic testing is designed to discover the potential of pupils. The latter can be used in comparison with what children are actually achieving. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said that she was not happy about normative testing, but one cannot have one form of testing without the other. Both must be used to compare potential with actual achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have been teachers know that brighter pupils can sit at the back of the class and coast along. They achieve less than they should. That is a terrible waste of the child's potential but, being bright pupils, they can still shine. That is the fundamental problem with mixed-ability education, and it is why I firmly oppose it. In mixed-ability schools tests are more, rather than less, necessary. If the organisation of the school does not reflect potential and actual achievement adequately by streaming, banding, setting or a mixture of them, standardised tests must be used as frequently as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill has expressed the fear that people will misuse the results of tests and said that that is one of her objections to testing. She fears that league tables will be constructed and that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1336</span>
people will draw the wrong conclusions. The same facts have been before the Committee, and both sides have drawn different conclusions from them. Interpretation of facts is not the problem. It is ducking the issue to argue that we should keep information secret or not collate it because it will be misused. The Committee has collected information and has drawn different conclusions, but it is not an answer to say that we should not hold tests because we shall not agree on the conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is too much emotion in the argument about testing. I shall consider the comprehensive sector because 94 per cent. of our children attend such schools. The independent sector can do what it wants. In a normal comprehensive school, it is for the head and the other teachers to decide how they measure the potential of pupils. Hon. Members suggest that the concept of continuous assessment is good, but that the concept of testing is for some reason bad. Regular testing would be the same as continual assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is describing it, testing provides a snapshot of a child in relation to his or her peer group at a particular stage in development. Continuous assessment takes into account a variety of factors, including the social background and the problems that a child may have at home. Therefore, an overall picture of the child is built up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right, but if the snapshots are put together one obtains an overall picture. I agree that if the tests are held at the age of eight and 12, their value is limited because a lot has been missed out in the middle. The ups and downs have been omitted. The economy goes up and down, but we do not measure it every five years. We measure it constantly to see what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) made the point—and I support it—that these tests should not be the only form of assessment. Even though I accept that tests are part of the process, my hon. Friend is giving the impression—I am sure that he does not wish to— that assessment can be made simply by building up from a series of tests. Surely that cannot be done. The issue is wider than that. For example, we should also take account of the development of the school curriculum and the use of projects, especially in secondary schools, as opposed to straight examinations. Tests are one element, but not the only element, even if they are combined with other tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right, hon. Friend is right. I was not arguing that a collection of tests added together gives a picture. But project work or teacher assessment of a pupil is part of the judging process. Someone has to judge a child's project. A test is a written form of judgment and because it is standardised and objective it is fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue about the words "testing", "assessment" and "judgment", but they are all part of the process.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1337</span>
Opposition Members should not recoil from the concept of testing. We are deluding ourselves if we believe that children, as they grow older, do not know what they can and cannot do. A young child of five or six will not try to climb something—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is part of the early process. Children will not attempt a physical task that they have tried before and failed. But they do not regard themselves as failures; they go on to something else. They do not sit back and cry. They school should not say, "This is the be all and end all, you have failed, so that is it. The school should provide alternative projects for them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what Opposition Members are driving at. A child should not decide that he cannot do something at an early age and go on to something else. If proper diagnostic tests of that child's attainments were carried out to discover why he was unable to do a task at that stage, concerned teachers might find that after a little more work he could do it. It is absurd to conclude at primary 4 that a child cannot do arithmetic or English when many people, given the right encouragement, have done well in later life in things that they thought that they could not do when they were younger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) has been in education, so he should realise that the whole point of a balanced education curriculum is to ensure that children do not feel that they should write off certain subjects at a young age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady. The role of a good teacher is to obtain the right information. The question is what use should be made of that information. The hon. Lady cannot, in all honesty, expect a child to do all things equally well. By obtaining and using that information, a teacher can identify what a pupil can do and what subjects he can do better than others. Of necessity, a comparison will be made because he will be in a class of 20 or 30 other pupils. Those comparisons cannot be avoided and the pupils know that. To say that children should be protected from themseves is an emotional argument. Children aged from five to 16 or 18 form judgments about their abilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We allow older pupils to specialise in certain subjects. We can argue about whether they should be allowed to do so at 14, 11, 12 or 16, but we accept that process. I believe that that process can be started earlier. Specialisation is not wrong, provided that it does not exclude the acquisition of knowledge and skills. Specialisation is wrong if we do not allow a child to develop a subject that he is good at and make him concentrate on something else. It is cruel to persuade or encourage a child who has limited academic ability or who is not good at sport to carry on those activities when he is desperately unhappy. I have been a teacher and I have seen children who are despearately unhappy because they have been forced to particiapte in sporting activities that they are not good at. It is wrong. They know that they cannot do it. The teacher knows that they cannot do it. Why make them do it? That applies to academic subjects too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1338</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a deterministic view about what children can and cannot do: if they cannot do something they should move on. There are such things as attitude and motivation. They are the key. Assessment should promote attitude and motivation, which, my experience of teaching in schools in Glasgow and elsewhere leads me to believe are very important. Attitudes and motivation can be found in middle-class areas, where the children can get ahead; they are not often found in less well-off areas, where children do not have confidence. If they are given confidence, it will promote attitude and motivation, and then they can get on. That is why diagnostic testing and assessment to ascertain the particular stage that they have reached is very important. It offers the opportunity for organic growth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me. My philosophy is based on merit. I support the concept of selection and testing because I believe that people's ability to get on should result from their innate ability rather than their class, wealth or where they live. I do not give a damn about a person's class, address or surname. I want to know what each child is capable of. We must measure a child's potential. That is why we must have diagnostic testing. It is all very well to measure a child's potential, but we must measure it against what he or she is achieving. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is right in this sense. Some surveys have found that once a child's potential has been measured and the actual achievement in an inner-city comprehensive is compared with that in a nice middle-class suburban comprehensive, the gap starts to widen. That is worrying. What do we do about it? The problem will not be solved by not publishing test results or by pretending that everyone can achieve as much as everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without getting bogged down in semantics, another important point has been raised. Does the hon. Member not agree that if one takes a child-centred education, which is the basis of individualism, it would be more appropriate for children who are over-achieving and under-achieving to be the subject of diagnostic testing? I agree that all children should do well. If children have natural ability, they should get on, even in a mixed ability class. But does the hon. Member not agree that the use of national normative testing would reveal the individual child's performance, compared with that of all other children? Surely the most important thing is to measure a child's performance against his or her own ability. The hon. Member used the phrase "innate ability". In Fife we call it native ability. Surely that is the best enrichment that we can offer in education. We should allow the diagnosis to lead either to assistance, in terms of getting more learning support to do well or, if a child is over-achieving, to more stimulus and more encouragement in a mixed ability class to do even better. Is that not the most obvious point about diagnostic testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right. That is exactly the point of diagnostic testing. It aims to

find out the innate ability of that child. We agree on that. I define normative testing as finding out what the child is actually achieving. Unless one can do that and can compare it with what he or she can achieve, it is not possible to identify and make provision for progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the widening gap between inner-city and middle-class suburban comprehensives. Without normative testing, neither the pupil nor the school can be properly assessed. Part of my former job was to assess schools. I knew that one school would always be at the top of any league table because it had a selective intake. I was happy to support that. I knew that that school would come top in exam results. However, I was not very interested in that; I wanted to know how far ahead the children were, compared with where they could have been. I knew that one school would always be at the bottom of the league table, but that was not the point. The point was whether the school was doing the best it could, given its intake. Unless there is diagnostic and normative testing, one will never know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like one point to be clarified. The hon. Member for Hexham said that when he was responsible for assessing schools he knew that some schools would always come out on top and that others would always be at the bottom. How did he go about that assessment? The results seem to be predetermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had better not digress too much, Mr. Martin, but I should like to respond to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had league tables of exam results, and before the Government made publication compulsory in the Education Act 1980, we published our results. Labour members of the council said that that was outrageous, that some schools would be oversubscribed and that others would empty. They said that the world would cave in and that I could not publish results. But I ignored them and did it. The world did not cave in; the schools carried on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the information, so why should the public not have it? After all, they are the ratepayers and the parents. I introduced a system of standardised tests at the age of 11 so that over the years we could compare the intake with the output. By using those two measures we could assess whether a school was achieving as much as it could achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of party politics, Opposition Members would have been interested in the results. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>1340</span>
showed what I thought was happening but could not prove because I did not have the necessary information. When we had that information, we could do something about it. We wanted not to bash schools but to help them. We diverted more resources to schools with relatively bad results so that they could do better. And they did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the hon. Gentleman's earlier remarks implied that if there were not normative testing there would be no way of assessing a school's ability to teach or of judging the performance of the school, but several ways already exist. They are tried, tested and well known. The school's ability to teach pupils well and the quality of its staff are monitored by inspectors. The fact that a teacher must register with the General Teaching Council means that that teacher's performance and class have been tested by an experienced teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the matter is that normative testing is not about genuinely testing pupils' ability. We have been assured that it is not designed to sort the sheep from the goats. It is becoming clear that it is about drawing up a league table of schools. We are going back to what the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) did many weeks ago. He made unfair comparisons between Bearsden and Possilpark secondary schools. I strongly suspect that that is what will come out of normative testing. There will be a league table, which will make extremely unfair comparisions that take no account of social class, poverty and unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a wide-ranging but enjoyable intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has highlighted the philosophical differences between us. We might not be able to bridge them, but we have improved our understanding of each other's positions. However, it is not an answer to fail to seek information and to refuse to release it to the public because of what people might do. Mankind is advancing rapidly. For example, we have knowledge to produce nuclear weapons. However, man's challenge is not so much that of possessing nuclear weapons as of using knowledge in a proper and sensible manner. In education, my experience was that teachers, education authorities and Government use information sensibly. They do not want to destroy schools and the future careers of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a constructive and informed contribution, based on his expertise. There has been some confusion in the debate about diagnostic and normative testing. One of the other conditions will be the national normative referencing system. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us who devised the banks of items used in testing in his authority? It would have been the school or the education authority. It certainly would not have been the Department of Education and Science. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that important distinction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my authority, I asked the education officers to advise the committee as to which tests
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1341</span>
were most suitable, bearing in mind that they had to produce the information that we wanted. They considered a number of schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman confirming that the tests were not devised nationally—that the series of tests and assessment materials were devised by the education authority and that they were applied locally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they were national tests, but there were a number of different national tests that could have been used. We tended to use the National Foundation for Education Research tests in order to measure the performance of individual pupils and schools and to compare our authority with others. It is possible that our authority was not doing as well as it might.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was helpful, because we shall later debate the Government's intentions on the banks of items that will be used. The hon. Gentleman has explained that, although a range of national testing items was available, it was appropriate for his authority to select which one to apply within its schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a range of tests were available we chose one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between sides of the Committee on testing. However, I ask the Opposition not to worry too much about the provision of information. It is possible that people will maliciously use it, but I do not believe that politicians, education authorities or teachers would do so. There will be enormous safeguards. Education authorities are run by elected councillors, and Parliament is run by elected Members. There will always be that final check. The only fear is that we ourselves would misuse the information, and I take the charitable view that that is not the intention of those of us who seek the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been one of the most stimulating debates in the Committee for some weeks. That is partly because this issue always arouses controversy. As I listened to hon. Members try to define normative and diagnostic testing, I recalled the lectures of Professor Stanley Nisbet, who was my professor of education at Glasgow university. I suspect that he would not have awarded members of the Committee alpha pluses or alpha minuses for their attempt at definitions. It is almost impossible to separate the two, but the key issue is the purpose to which the tests will be put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) made a relevant contribution on the issue of normative versus diagnostic testing, so I shall not go to deeply into that. There is a difference between a test that is applicable across the board to every child, irrespective of his or her abilities, and a test that is designed specifically for an individual child to assess a particular problem that that youngster may have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1342</span>
I said to the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) that I regard normative testing as a snapshot of a particular peer group at a particular stage. It gives general guidance to everyone, and any teacher worth his or her salt uses such testing as part and parcel of everyday classroom life. It is a strange teacher who does not do that, because one has to access children's standards. Such testing is undertaken not just to see how children are managing but to diagnose how teachers are putting across the subject. Sometimes that is the only way that teachers can assess how the children are coping with what is put to them. Teachers may have to reconsider their methods— how to make boring subjects more exciting and whether they need to do more preparation before going into the classroom to work with the children. There is a diagnostic aspect to the use of those tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not now talking about internal classroom use. It has emerged from one or two Conservative Members' speeches that we are moving towards national standards. The Minister referred to bands of levels of attainment. What happens to those bands and what is their purpose if not for comparison and to be able to determine that X school is better than Y school? How will those bands be set against other aspects and problems of a school's environment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady suggesting that it is all right for teachers to find out how the child is doing so as to reassure them about the quality of their teaching but that our proposals to communicate such information to parents is not all right? The only purpose of the test material for individual performance is to give parents the type of information that the hon. Lady says that teachers find reassuring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those results should not be kept secret from parents. Every classroom teacher wants to be able to discuss results with parents. Most education authorities have evolved a system to advise parents of their children's progress in such tests. That is why there are evenings when parents can come to the school. If, when I was a teacher I found that a child's standards had suddenly slipped substantially, I would contact the parents. Sometimes the problem may relate to the home environment—to a lost opportunity to do homework, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Good teaching practice already provides for that, but not on a national comparative basis. That is one of my real anxieties about the proposal. We are discussing the question of relating to the local community. Parents want to know how their children are doing in a particular school. They do not want long lists, informing them that if they move to a different region conditions will be better or worse. They want to know how their child is doing in the school that he or she attends. I do not like the idea of league tables. They would not be conducive to good educational practice and development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that we have made it clear that the test results will be confidential and reported only to parents. Is she saying that it is all right to tell parents how their children are doing regarding the standards of achievement in the school,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1343</span>
but that it is not all right regarding standards in the country as a whole? Most parents would surely want the latter information. They recognise that when their children leave school they may have to find a place in the labour market elsewhere and compete according to the standards achieved in the country as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks as though every school evolves a totally individual and different curriculum, but the reality in Scotland is that national standards are already set by means of various aspects of the curriculum—especially in secondary schools where I gained most of my experience. Certainly, in the primary schools with which I had contact the staff were aware of national standards and all involved were teaching towards the same standards. One anticipated what would happen in the secondary schools. Her Majesty's inspectorate exists to ensure that no school is wholly out of line with national provision. That is why we are all forwarded reports on individual schools within our constituencies. I have received two in the past fortnight which show that very high standards exist in two schools in my constituency, as defined by Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools. Surely, it has a responsibility for observing that national standards do not slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Continuous assessment was mentioned by the hon. Member for Hexham. Everyone involved in education would argue that continuous assessment is the best form of assessment and at no time should one recommend a child solely on the results of tests for presentation work. I do not know whether it still happens as it is a long time since I was in a classroom, but when we classroom teachers were engaged in presentation work with children in fourth, fifth and sixth years, we were asked to submit reports on whether children were above or below the line prior to presentation. That assessment was not based on the results of tests that we may have set, although that was part of the exams; other aspects about the commitment of the children to work and how they performed in class were taken into account. Account would be taken of the fact that children, like adults, could have off days for various reasons, so it would be wrong to accept test results on that basis alone. I favour continuous assessment while also taking normative assessment into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) the Minister said that a child who was taken out of a classroom for diagnostic testing would surely have a sense of failure. As one who was involved in the administration of such testing, I maintain that a child would have a greater sense of failure from having to sit in a classroom and be taught a subject which he or she could not basically understand. Often, such children became disruptive elements. Sometimes they would be given a book to colour to pass the time or be sent out on obscure errands to deliver notes to other teachers and so on. Diagnostic testing has been effective in working out a pattern of education and programmes for children with individual learning needs. It is a child-centred form of testing, whereas normative testing is centred towards a standard that is vague and not directly related to a child. That is not a perfect definition and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1344</span>
I am sure that the Minister will provide others when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How the Minister responds to the debate will affect the way in which many of us will regard the amendments. Some of the most critical educational aspects of the legislation have been touched on in the debate and it will be interesting to hear the Minister's reply. I wish to ask him a few questions and I hope that he will give me clear answers as I genuinely seek information from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be involved in the preparation of the tests? Will it be the inspectorate? Who will set the standards? What budget has been set aside to provide the tests and to build up a bank of tests? Who will monitor the tests? Will it be the teacher, the school or an outside organisation? What training will be given to those who administer the tests?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the administration is genuinely vital to the achievement of good results. I remember being defined as deaf in primary school because I did not understand the test. I had to wear headphones, not unlike those being worn throughout the Committee by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Strange noises came through the earphones and I had to identify them. Because I had not been given a correct explanation, I did not know what was happening. I failed miserably and had to be retested. Fortunately, the second person explained the test and I was defined as having very good hearing. It is a complex and highly skilled task to administer any test, especially a standard test. I was trained in the administration of standardised tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that there is a possibility of selection as a result of these tests? The Secretary of State has stated clearly that he opposes academic selection on the result of tests. I would welcome a straight commitment from the Minister along the same lines because, in Scotland, there is a genuine fear that we shall return to selection that is based solely on academic qualifications. That would be strongly resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 63 does not spell out primary 4 and primary 7 for the administration of tests, although that was in the consultative document. The provisions in the clause are extremely broad. They give the Secretary of State powers to implement tests at other stages, in primary school especially. Can the Minister assure us that he is not talking about annual tests at all levels in primary schools? Those are straight questions to which I should like straight answers. I hope that the Minister will give a positive response to the debate which will have been heard with interest by education circles in Scotland and by concerned parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. To put our fears into context, I draw the Committee's attention to the press notice issued by the Secretary of State for Education and Science on 3 October 1988 he announced the conclusion of the curriculum and assessment proposals. He stated on page 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hold the view that testing on a nationally standardised basis is a vital ingredient in securing these objectives"—</p></blockquote>
those of curriculum assessment. Later he stated:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1345</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposals on assessment testing produced the greatest interest and occasioned much comment."</p></blockquote>
The anxiety of my hon. Friends can be summed up in the four areas of concern to the Secretary of State himself. The press release stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Firstly, tests might be used to rank children in class or to determine their progress to secondary school.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Secondly, tests might put intolerable pressure on children who would risk being branded failures as early as 8 years old.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Thirdly, tests might be used to construct league tables of schools without regard to the circumstances under which schools operate.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Fourthly, tests might distort the curriculum by forcing or encouraging teachers to teach to the test."</p></blockquote>
That sums up in the proverbial nutshell the general anxieties voiced at the time of consultation on the curriculum and assessment proposals and they are as germane today as then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have another major anxiety. Without going into the semantics of how we define normative as against diagnostic and the national dimension where national test banks are introduced as a basis for carrying out tests, I urge the Minister to respond to further points, among them those that were raised by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). We should like to know what we are measuring when we talk of testing or assessing in any form. Why are we measuring in this way? That is a simple question. What use will be made of the information? Much of our debate has focused on the distinction between national or normative testing and diagnostic testing. There is serious anxiety about the use of the material after it has been established. Clause 63 is difficult because it anticipates consultation, discussion and regulation about implementing the Government's wish to have primary 4 and primary 7 testing of maths and English initially and then widening that out in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to put on the record the key fear of education authorities—I know that Fife regional council is worried—about testing and the use that might be made of it. A briefing paper from Fife regional council and the convention of Scottish Local Authorities states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's response, however, is not to build on good practice. It is intended that national advice will be issued on assessment policy and methods to accompany the guidelines for each area of the curriculum. The advice will show how the results of assessment can be used both to improve learning and teaching and to report achievement."</p></blockquote>
The Minister talks about relevance but the paper continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Past experience is that such national advice in the form of MMI and SCCC documents has been highly generalised and desperately short on practical guidance. This is not surprising because very little is known about good assessment practice in primary education and the Government should instead, be planning to conduct thorough and substantial research to obtain the necessary knowledge if the acceptable aims are to be in any way realised."</p></blockquote>
That is a contribution from Fife regional council, which I regard as expert in diagnostic testing. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that the Scottish Office and educationists are finding it difficult to comprehend how national standardised tests can be applied to every school in Scotland, regardless of the local situation or the diagnostic methods that are currently deployed. I hope that the Minister will comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1346</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that all my advice suggests that there will be no difficulty about devising the tests and providing the material. Of course, there are difficulties in establishing something that is completely new. We have set an ambitious timetable and I am advised that we shall meet it, as one would expect the Government to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I should take comfort from part of the Minister's reply, but I have fears about it, too. If the Minister speaks to the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, COSLA, individual authorities or teachers' unions, he will find that people are anxious about the time scale. That could be solved by having little regard to the quality of standardised items that will be included in the national testing procedure, in which case, we would be very worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have hoped that it would be accepted that it is a difficult task to undertake and implement. If it is not undertaken sensitively, the raison d'etre behind the measure could collapse. Most education authorities, such as Fife, have an excellent system and do not need the Government's suggestions. They will have the dilemma of adapting a system that works adequately and efficiently to the sort of programme being considered by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to Fife and it would be useful to state that I have asked COSLA to conduct a survey on the current state of testing in Scotland. I have a paper that summarises the position. The application of testing throughout Scotland is very patchy. Some authorities, such as Fife, have an extensive programme of assessment, while other do not share Fife's philosophy about the need for assessment and very little practical assessment takes place. In Fife, testing is carried out at several stages at primary school level and informal assessment is carried out at pre-school age in nursery education. The key of the diagnostic approach is to ensure that any difficulties are quickly picked up so that they may be tackled and so that development through the primary school programme is as good as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important matter is what happens to the results. I understand that in Fife parents are not given the results of the enormous amount of testing that is carried out. My two children have gone through the primary system. I am sure that if there were major problems, parents would be advised whether special learning support—that used to be called remedial education—were required and whether any anxieties of the child or the parents needed to be tackled by the disclosure of information. People may not have qualms about providing such sensitive information to parents, but that must be balanced against the purpose of that information. As a parent in Fife, I have never received any information about the tests that have been carried out on my two children between primary 1 and primary 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to show the difference between a national frame of reference for testing and diagnostic tests. In Fife, the results of testing are maintained on pupils' files for one year and are then withdrawn. Only a record of any action taken or professional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1347</span>
involvement is retained. The details of the problem are not retained; only the action taken to remedy the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other interesting feature of diagnostic testing is revealed in a letter to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities from the director of education of Fife regional council, dated 15 February 1989, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The results are used in making decisions about the allocation of learning support time to schools within the region and as one of the factors in determining the distribution of what were the Circular 991 staff and of classroom auxiliaries."</p></blockquote>
The structure of diagnostic testing in Fife is geared specifically to the child. It does not involve national league tables, school versus school, or child against child. That is vital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Is he saying that Fife does not give information to parents and is he in favour of that or against it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question and I shall reply to it as a parent, not as a politician.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a parent in Fife, I have never received any information from my children's school about specific tests. But if my children had required specific support, perhaps I would have received that information. I would not speak against parents being allowed access to such information, but there is a distinction between that and a school, especially in Fife with its extensive programme of testing, reporting every test to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the Minister's curriculum assessment document, we expect a new report card, which I support, to come on stream during the next year. A balance must be struck between what the report card tells parents about their children and what parents wish to know about the specific tests that are carried out. I have trust and faith in schools and teachers and if the tests are properly conceived, there is no cause for concern. But that is a personal view rather than a political statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's personal views. One of my difficulties is that I am not allowed to have personal views and I am surprised that Labour Front-Bench spokesmen may have personal views on such important matters. Will the hon. Gentleman say, on behalf of the Opposition, whether he thinks that authorities such as Fife, which test but do not give the information to parents, should do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister recalls my phrase I said that I would not speak against that. Perhaps I should be more political and say that I do not oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman in favour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I choose my words very carefully. A sensitive set of issues surround the matter and they cannot be politicised as the Government have politicised much of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1348</span>
Fife has been testing children for many years and has the most extensive testing programme in Scotland. It seems to work in the sense that there is no presumption that test results will be given to parents. I support Fife, but I would not deny parents access to any information about their children. To answer the Minister specifically, the notion about giving information to parents could not be opposed, because a relationship clearly exists between parents and pupils. However, I advise the Minister to be extremely cautious about how that is structured in terms of Scottish education. The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) made a valuable contribution about what happened in his area. How the information is used is critical, not only to the working of schools and education authorities, but to children's education. So although the Minister may wish to ask me for a political view, the Government should approach this delicate subject with sensitivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not simply a matter of handing parents a note about their child's performance in a given test, as the Minister seems to believe? If an effort is being made to encourage a child to perform better, there must be more to it. We are up against great problems in the real world, such as schools that run parents' nights at which only parents of able and high achieving pupils turn up. We must consider the problem of parents whose response to failure is a cuff around the ear. How will that contribute to the child attaining a better performance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises some valuable points. In response to her concern, the Minister may wish to build into regulations that all school boards will be consulted about whether the children in their school wish to have the information from the national test given to parents. That would be consultation, and there is to be a great deal of consultation in terms of the regulations, so the issue should be further discussed. There are no tablets of stone on testing and only an extremely foolish Scottish Office would decide otherwise. Experts on Scottish education, not only in the academic world, say that there would be major difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We began by discussing the distinction between diagnostic and normative testing. Authorities such as Fife have great fears about the Scottish Office, the Minister or any Government—Conservative or Labour—having standardised information on pupils available for use. They are also concerned about centralised national advice and attainment levels on a national scale. Education authorities, such as Fife, do not wish to see that, but the Bill is about to impose them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the many constructive comments that have been made and give assurances that the consultation period will be exhaustive. Mistakes made at this early stage could have disastrous consequences for children in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been one of the best debates in this Committee. I am not sure how to deal with some of the questions, as they strayed into clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1349</span>
stand part. I shall stick to the amendment and pick up the points that are directly related to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition want testing to be diagnostic. That seems to be the catchphrase of the progressive consensus in education in Scotland. I have tried to press Opposition Members on what they mean by diagnostic testing, and how it differs from the tests that we shall introduce and from some of the tests currently set to pupils in Scottish schools. Diagnostic testing is the process which pinpoints a pupil's particular difficulty with a part of the curriculum and tells us why that has happened. It is a valuable and inescapable part of good teaching. We are not against it; we want to encourage it and help to make it more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is precisely what our proposals for assessment and nationally standardised testing will do. National testing will provide a benchmark and objective criteria against which teachers can check their assessment of a pupil's progress and parents can see at a glance whether their children are lagging behind or marching ahead of children across the country generally. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) pointed that out.

I may say as an aside to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that I am delighted to have his confirmation that Fife does not report the results to parents. He will recall that on Second Reading his hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) interrupted me and asked me to withdraw my comments when I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Fife, information is not passed on to parents. Therein lies the difference between us and Opposition Members, who do not believe that parents are entitled to be involved in schools or to have information."</p></blockquote>
Of course, we have had Strathclyde since then. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that the Minister would not wish to mislead the House. Will he kindly withdraw his remark about Fife? I assure him that Fife regional council's teachers discuss the results of tests with parents. I know because my children have been through its schools. As he believes that diagnostic and normative testing are the same, will he give us any evidence that suggests that that is so?"</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) made it clear that the Minister has misled the House. I am not saying that he did it deliberately. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, I have two children who have gone through the Fife education system. We get results from teachers at every stage. It is not on for the Minister to make a statement and then to refuse to withdraw it. He has impugned the reputation of Fife regional council and the teachers in Fife. He should withdraw what he said, if he has any decency at all."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; vol. 148, c.699–670.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) took the opportunity after that debate to set the record straight, because he has told the Committee that what the hon. Member for Falkirk, East said is not the case in Fife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to point out that I am not responsible for hon. Members in the parliamentary Labour party or from Fife—in other words, for my hon. Friends the Members for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) and for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie).
	<span class='label label-info column'>1350</span>
The Minister has taken the matter slightly out of context. I thought that the comment made was that at each stage one was informed of the progress of the children. The Minister has made a valid point and I hope that I have made clear the position in Fife. I hope that that is true, because I do not have any factual evidence to justify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. What I said on Second Reading was true and what he said in Committee was true. What his two hon. Friends said on Second Reading was not true. It is important, because therein lies the difference between us. In all the arguments about terminology, what seemed to emerge was a consensus in the Committee in favour of testing, but the concern centred around what was done with the results. It is a perfectly reasonable concern, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked for reassurances on that. I am happy to give those reassurances. The tests will be used to give information about the levels of attainment of the children. That information will be kept private. It will be communicated to the parents and known to the teachers. Its purpose will be to judge the stage that the children have reached against defined standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What procedures are there to prevent a head teacher of a secondary school asking a parent what the child attained in the primary 7 test, thereby making it a condition for entry into a particular secondary school? What provisions does the Minister have in mind to prevent that type of abuse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, the local education authority would take a dim view of a head teacher who sought to overturn the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of a self-governing school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke from a sedentary position of a self-governing school. But the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) about how many self-governing schools the Opposition expect has not yet been answered. A self-governing school will be bound by the admission policy contained in its scheme of government, which we discussed at great length at 4 o'clock one morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never stated that Scotland will not have self-governing schools. I admit that if the Government use their financial muscle to put through a Bill with 74 clauses and 10 schedules, there will be self-governing schools. If a head teacher of a self-governing school asks that question, will it be an abuse or is the Minister happy that such a question can be asked? It would have the effect of a selective test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, anyone can ask a daft question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be silly to ask what level of attainment a child had achieved in the primary 4

	<span class='label label-info column'>1351</span>
examination in mathematics, especially as a result of our reforms. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside was particularly concerned about that, as was the hon. Member for Moray. Contrary to what she said, there is not a defined national primary curriculum in Scotland. There is wide variation. The curriculum and assessment proposals will result in guidance being given for the first time for a national curriculum in the primary sector. The proposals on testing are one tiny part of our general proposals to introduce methods of assessment across the whole curriculum at primary 1 to primary 7. It is important to see that in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new report card will give parents information about the levels of attainment and performance of their children across the curriculum at each stage in their primary career. Only the test information in primary 4 and primary 7 is related to what we are discussing. Far more information of that sort will be made available. I hope that that reassures my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside, who felt that it would be undesirable if those tests were the only information, and were a make or break. It would also be highly undesirable if, in carrying out the tests, we went back to the system that we all experienced of sitting in a hall or classroom with the air crackling with tension and the pencils sharp for "The Exam". The test materials can be administered by teachers at a time of their choosing within the constraints of the time of year and as part of the general work. The idea that it is an oppressive hurdle is misguided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national tests will provide a benchmark and objective criteria. With that information, teachers can, through further diagnostic testing if necessary, provide the right sort of curricular help. Just as important, parents will be able to demand it. On that point, my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and the hon. Member for Moray reached agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what I gather the Scottish Examination Board will hold the tests and schools will go to it for them. The Government are looking for consistent methods of assessment and consistent national levels of attainment. The Minister said that they would provide a benchmark. If that is so, surely it would not be daft for a head teacher to ask a question about the reports because he would know about the national tests and the quality of education that should be attained. It would be a precise measurement of attainment and would encourage selection among children going from primary to secondary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a daft question because a head teacher of a secondary would be interested in a report of the child's progress at primary school in order to ensure that the secondary school can do its best for the child. Parents would also be interested in that wider information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be nothing oppressive or terrifying about the nationally standardised tests. We have consistently made it clear that they will be drawn from a central bank and applied and marked by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1352</span>
schools themselves. A central bank conjures up an image of building or a centre, but the test materials could be on floppy discs for print out on computers in schools. It is not something to be feared. The hon. Member for Fife, Central has repeatedly said that in Fife testing is done by the education authority and that the new system would be done nationally as though that represented an awesome threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain to the hon. Gentleman what it means. Then he can tell me why it is such a threat. Nationally standardised tests will be available on tap to all education authorities, which will not have to devise them themselves. The authorities can be confident that the tests will be put together with the best advice and expertise that the Scottish Examination Board can obtain. The hon. Gentleman should not laugh at the board. It has served Scotland well and no one questions its integrity or ability to run O-grade, standard grade or higher examinations. It is appropriate that the Scottish Examination Board should help the education authorities to run tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consensus which possibly existed on the need for some forms of testing is begining to disintegrate. The Minister is now dealing with our central concerns. Why does the Fife system, which is successful and accepted by parents, have to give way? It is a local system based on experience and professional input. The Government talk about diversity, choice and freedom. Why should Fife have to accept a national standardised system of test items that may or may not be useful to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that Fife would not have to give way. Fife holds testing in primary 1, primary 3, primary 5 and primary 7. That is far too ambitious for national testing. If I had suggested testing at those levels, a queue of people would have said, "All those little tots coming to school for the first time, and that wicked Mr. Forsyth is putting them through exams." That is what the Opposition would have said. In some respect, Fife's system goes much further than our proposals. When my officials looked at the test papers, they were surprised at the extent to which they are normative tests. I congratulate Fife on what is has done and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would want to take credit, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government welcome Fife's example and wish to develop proper national standards so that parents in Fife will know how well their children are doing in school and how that compares throughout Scotland. The Opposition should welcome the ability to consider the criteria for the country generally. We shall probably benefit from Fife's experience in developing those ideas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a generous man, but we cannot accept his distorted view of Fife's proposals. Fife has an extensive diagnostic system of appraisal. The Minister praised Fife. If that system is working well—attainment in Fife schools is no worse and perhaps better than in other parts of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1353</span>
Scotland—why will he not allow flexibility so that Fife could say to him, "We are grateful for your efforts on behalf of parents but we have a better system. We do not want to implement a national normative reference system which uses a bank of itemised testing measures"? Why cannot Fife be left alone to get on with it? Why does the Minister want to centralise and interfere with a system that seems to be working well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little confused. Fife, or any other education authority, is free to develop as they choose testing systems and systems of assessment. But at two stages in the primary child's school career he will sit tests in English and mathematics. Parents will know their child's level of attainment and will be able to compare it with the levels of attainment of children in other parts of Scotland. Fife can get on and do whatever else it considers appropriate, as can other authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife is a more developed authority. Testing carried out in Fife is not diagnostic; it is normative. It is standardised against performance in the region. Why is the hon. Member for Fife, Central in favour of normative testing, which compares performance in Fife, but against normative testing, which compares performance in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his previous contribution the Minister referred to primary 5 mathematics testing. Important characteristics must be hung on this loose definition of normative testing in Fife. Those tests are not Scottish Office standardised tests or examination board tests. That is an important distinction. The system in Fife is being distorted. The purpose of testing is crucial. In Fife it is to ensure that in child-centred educational development the use of the test is only for that child. It is diagnostic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be suggesting that in one area there is a normative element. That is a different distinction and it should be drawn properly. It should not be suggested that diagnostic testing is not carried out in Fife. It is carried out, using the clinical definition of the word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman uses the word "clinical," but I do not dispute that diagnostic testing is carried out in Fife. The testing carried out in primary 3, primary 5 and primary 7 is normative. That is the advice that I have been given by the inspectorate and by officials. That is also my judgment after looking at the covering material—I have that advantage over the hon. Gentleman—and considering how items are standardised. I accept that there is a difference between our proposals and those of Fife. The hon. Gentleman referred to tests set by the Scottish Office. Tests will not be set by the Scottish Office; they will be administered by the Scottish Examination Board and the test items will be compiled by educationists and teachers of experience and distinction. No one in the Scottish Office will sit down and write out test material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now received from the chief inspector the results of the grammar school bursary examination
	<span class='label label-info column'>1354</span>
of 1883. I have the completed answer script but I have not received a single script from hon. Members. Any hon. Member who submits one by the end of the Committee's deliberations may receive a bottle of whisky without too much of a performance. If any hon. Members are interested in seeing the answers after the competition has closed, I shall be happy to oblige them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that the Highlands and Islands paper was a diagnostic test. I was interested in what the Minister said about parents being able to compare throughout Scotland the results of these tests in primary 4 and primary 7. He referred in particular to the people of Fife, on whom we seem to have concentrated, and to how they could make comparisons elsewhere. How exactly can those comparisons be made? How can a parent with a child at a primary school in Lossiemouth in my constituency make a comparison with a primary school in the centre of Glasgow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) touched on this point. We are now getting to the nub of the problem. When children arrive in primary school they have differing levels of ability. They will have reached different stages in reading. Some children will have done some reading at home. During the course of their school career that gap may grow and children will move to different points within it. By defining levels of attainment and by defying the norm, it is possible to see what level a child has attained, what the average child in Scotland might be expected to achieve and whether he or she is above or below it. If there are difficulties, such as with reading, diagnostic testing will enable the source of the problem to be identified and action to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that she used that information to give her some idea of how well the children were responding to her teaching. The difference is that we are proposing to give that information to parents so that they can point out to the school that their child is performing well below what they expect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well below what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would point out that their child's performance in reading is well below what the average nine-year-old child in Scotland might be expected to achieve, and they would ask why that was so. There might be reasons for it. If the hon. Member for Fife, Central is shocked by that, I must remind him that the vast majority of parents in Scotland want to know how well their children are doing at school; they want to be reassured that they are being stretched and given opportunities compatible with their abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way questioning the right of parents to tell a school that their child is not doing as well as they would expect. That is to be greatly welcomed. However, is the Minister saying that as a result of these tests an average level of attainment, or a desirable level of attainment will be published? I still cannot see how the comparison can be made, unless a document is published giving the overall results of the tests in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1355</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may be right to argue that, but people will want to know whether their eight-year-old son or daughter is at level 2, 3 or 4 and which level they might be expected to be at. Some children might be above the expected level in reading but below it in mathematics. It is not unreasonable, if the school is in the centre of Glasgow and parents are concerned about it, that they should ask why, and what is being done about it. Perhaps more resources should go into that school. Perhaps there should be more special provision in the school. Our proposal makes available the school's output, which at present is known only to the classroom teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister on that point. No one denies the right of parents to argue for better provision for their children, but I am desperately anxious to discover how the parents are to get that comparison, based on the tests in primary 4 and primary 7. If that comparison is to be made, there must be a plan to publish an average or a desirable level of attainment. How do parents in Glasgow or in Lossiemouth know that their children are not doing as well as expected unless they have the benchmark that has been referred to? How will that benchmark be defined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the answer was not much good. I am having difficulty in discovering where the hon. Lady's difficulty lies. Perhaps she does not appreciate that in addition to a new report card, we shall also give information to parents about the levels of attainment that their children might be expected to reach across the curriculum and about the content of the curriculum in primary schools. That is part of the whole package on curriculum and assessment that we are proposing to release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of testing is not to rank children in class or to select them for secondary schools. It will provide necessary and useful information for teachers and parents about their children's standards, and they will be set against national standards that are commonly understood and interpreted. It will give a clear and unambiguous picture of how each child's learning should progress. There is nothing new about such testing. Similar practices take place in more than one education authority, including Fife, which we have discussed at great length. The Fife programme goes back as far as 1963.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central described those tests as diagnostic, I am intrigued by that definition. They have that purpose, but they also seek to set information on pupils' attainments against specified levels of mastery. If Fife's tests are diagnostic, so are the Government's, but with two vital differences: Fife's tests do not reflect a national standard and are not automatically and systematically reported to parents. The Opposition seem to think that parents should not be trusted with information about their children's progress, as they might not understand. I suggest that parents might understand too well and demand a better deal for their sons and daughters. That is precisely what nationally standardised testing would enable them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1356</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore the Minister's distortion of our comments about the ability of parents to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is making an interesting and entertaining contribution; he need not worry about going too quickly through it. I should like him to dwell on the average nine-year-old in Scotland and the subjects of English and mathematics. Can he provide a definition and a context? Will he respond to the specific question of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) about how the information is given to parents? Is it provided in a great tome that gives information on every pupil in every school in Scotland? How does the Minister work out bands and levels of attainment so that parents can measure their children's progress? Will he use the next 15 or 20 minutes to develop that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A group, under the chairmanship of the chief inspector, is working out the detailed answers. The key issues that ought to concern the Committee are these: is it possible to set attainment levels in English and mathematics and, to measure the extent to which children achieve them, and is it possible to standardise them nationally? We are advised that that is possible, and the test material will achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept—hopefully the Committee does too—the idea of a national norm at which a child's attainment can be set that will be discussed with the parents. Following the intervention of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), I am struggling slightly with two questions. First, I presume that there must be a period of testing and collation of results before the Scottish norm can be set, otherwise the level will be subjective and plucked from the air. How will the Scottish norm be set? As I understand it, it can be set only after the period has elapsed during which the results had been collated and assessed. The norm for the whole of Scotland can only be set on that basis and we shall know how children, schools, and regions are placed in relation to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, further to the point made by the hon. Member for Moray, I understand that once we have established the Scottish norm, it can be applied to an individual child. But we are interested to know whether the standard in that school at that stage will be set against the norm, too? Will it go further and be applied region against region? I should like a little more information about how the provision will be implemented. Many of us wish to know whether there will be league tables among schools and regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that it is true in Grampian, as it is true in other regions, that people already set league tables for schools. They make judgments on the bases of rumour, gossip, longstanding tradition and so on. People rank schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is true. People have different attitudes to specific schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1357</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing about that. I am simply asking how the material will be distributed. I am not expressing a view on the use to which it may be put. I just want to know about the arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what my right hon. Friend said, and I am trying to respond to his question about league tables in schools. I said that, in my view, people already rank schools in order of excellence. If the information on attainment levels that must be reported annually to the school board under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 results in the ranking of schools in terms of their performance and their being better informed, I see nothing wrong in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results that will be obtained across the board— not just test results, but the results of continuous assessment which Labour Members say they support—will be collated and the head teacher will report to the school board on the school's performance. Therefore, the information on performance that will be made known to the school board will be drawn from sources much wider than the test material. I dare say that it will be used to make comparisons between schools. Some people have argued that that is a bad thing, but it is unavoidable because people compare schools anyway. I hope that I have answered my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not completely. I was not referring to the actual testing. I accept all that my hon. Friend has said about the reporting procedure to the school board. I accept that one way and another, people will draw up league tables for schools. I am interested to know whether information on attainment levels within a particular school will be published either at a Scottish or national level, as opposed to the information being made known during the individual contact between the teacher and the parent? Will the test results be published, and if so, in what form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting slightly off beam. Two things are going on—one is how levels of attainment are set in divising the test material; the other is establishing the level of attainment that the child should reach. That could be done statistically by looking at what was achieved over a certain period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside said, if we intended to take that approach we should have to obtain the necessary information to enable us to draw a benchmark. By involving the Scottish Consultative Committee on the Curriculum we have set up a series of five review and development groups covering every aspect of the curriculum. They comprise representatives of education authorities, colleges of education and so on, and part of their remit is to establish levels of attainment that might reasonably be expected in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a misnomer to use the word "norm". I take "norm" to mean "average", but we are really talking about a target of attainment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1358</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to substitute "target" for "norm", although "target" implies an imperative. Conservative Members are keen to see an imperative, but my right hon. Friend's observation crystallises the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the average achievement for a nine-year-old in Scotland and said that parents could ask what their child has achieved in English or maths. Strathclyde region has featured a great deal in our debate. Schools in Bearsden and Eastwood have aways outstripped those in Possil and Pollock on examination results and they will continue to do so, given the social background of the children from those areas. If the Minister meant an average figure for nine-year-olds, parents in Bearsden or Eastwood who ask what their children will attain will be given a standard that is a variable benchmark. What can a parent get from that? The educational milieu there is vastly different from that in Possil and Pollock. Surely that argues for the assessment to be carried out in schools by those with local knowledge rather than having a meaningless average figure that cannot relate to specific areas or communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he wants assessment carried out on the basis of the local school and the local community so that parents of children in schools that do not equip children to meet what they might reasonably be expected to achieve at a certain age are unaware of the difference? If so, I find it difficult to accept. Schools that produce dramatically better results will have pupils who have difficulty with mathematics and English and who fall well below the norm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had this debate ad nauseam about the impact of social class, background and community. I subscribe to the view, which research bears out, that the ethos, organisation and input in a school has far more influence on outcomes than social class. Opposition Members shake their heads in disbelief. I presume that to maintain their sense of security, Labour authorities closed down schools like Our Lady and St. Francis, which was a good example of a school with a broadly-based intake. Although it accepted pupils from quite difficult backgrounds, it achieved remarkable results, but unfortunately cannot continue to do so. So there are variations.

I should like to do something which I never thought I would be able to do—call in aid 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</i> to support our policy proposals, particularly our view on assessment. The evidence from the reports on primary schools published by the inspectorate fully supports our contention that assessment policy in primary schools is inconsistent in its quality and application between and within schools. The hon. Member for Moray asked me about that. For confirmation, will the hon. Lady look at the survey conducted by 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland,</i> published in November 1988, on 40 primary schools inspected in that year? The survey provides an independent verification of our concerns.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1359</span>
It was conducted in a period following the original announcement of our proposals in November 1987. The conclusions of the survey are that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some schools have no policy or at least no explicit policy; some that do fail to implement it. Some teachers excel in their assessment. Others, even in the same school, barely do so. Education authorities which have policies cannot be confident that schools will follow them, according the the HMIs.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Ironically, given the criticism of the Forsyth proposals that testing in languages and maths will narrow the curriculum there is evidence from these reports that current practice also does just that. The reports are awash with injunctions to spread assessment beyond the basics."</p></blockquote>
That is a thought-provoking analysis. I did not think that I would ever say that about 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland.</i> The survey recognises that, generally, primary schools undertake assessment regularly and back it up with standardised testing. However, there is no cause for complacency and our initial contention was sound and well-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lest I am accused of selective quotation from a temperate editorial, the analysis goes on to consider whether national testing will correct those inconsistencies. National testing should not be seen in isolation—it should be taken together with our intention to publish national advice on assessment policy and practice. I am confident that it will help to secure more consistency of expectations by teachers and parents and to bring about a much more systematic and effective approach to assessing the achievements of all children in each aspect of the curriculum at all stages of the primary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members should recognise that standardised testing is widely practised in Scottish education authority schools. It is hypocrytical to pretend otherwise or to assume that current practice is radically different from what we envisage. In Borders, Central, Fife, Grampian and Highland, screening tests in aspects of reading and mathematics are employed in primary education. In other authorities such as Strathclyde, Lothian, Dumfries and Galloway, standardised tests are used in many schools without the education authority objecting. Our proposals have a perfectly respectable educational pedigree. The form of testing will not be at variance with established practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention I quoted the teachers' introduction to the mathematics test devised by Fife education authority at primary 5. The Guidance to Teachers says that the test is
	<br><blockquote><p>"seen as necessary to provide some security for teachers who are unsure of what attainment is reasonable for their stage"—</p></blockquote>
the very point which the hon. Member for Moray very honestly said was her own experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the principles that we envisage in the development of national testing in primary schools, and Fife has clearly recognised the benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked a number of technical questions. She asked who would prepare the tests. The primary assessment unit of the SEB will do so. She asked, too, what the budget for running the tests would be. The current estimate is £300,000 a year. She asked who would monitor and administer the tests. They will be administered by schools and monitored by the primary assessment unit of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1360</span>
SEB. In answer to her question about training, a programme for teachers is being prepared. The inspectorate, of course, will play a role in monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been fascinating. When we introduced our consultative paper on curriculum and assessment there was an explosion of anger from certain quarters. Listening to what the Opposition said then, I would never have dreamt that at this stage in the Committee's proceedings we should have reached such a consensus. It has emerged from the debate that the Opposition are in favour of testing. They will not say that they approve of the information being given to parents, but they are not against it. They have no objection—all that they are worried about is how the information will be used. That represents a move forward of Charles Gray proportions. The debate has been useful in revealing that development, and I am sure that the EIS will enjoy reading this afternoon's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered some of my questions but not all. The consultative document referred specifically to primary 4 and primary 7. The Minister said earlier that he envisaged a curriculum and assessment programme for all classes in primary school. Will there be formal tests of that nature in every year of the primary school? Will he give a straight answer to the question whether he believes in academic selection based on those tests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that tests in the form envisaged will be useful for that purpose—in fact they could not be so used because they are inappropriate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister believe in academic selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given several examples of selection based on ability—the school of dance, the school of music, classics and so on.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to give another small lecture on what constitutes academic ability. The Minister's claims will not wash. In Scotland it is widely perceived what academic selection is. Does the Minister want to talk about aptitude and ability? We have already discussed giftedness. Many safeguards could have been built into the Bill to allay fears. The Minister believes in academic selection, so he should say so on the record. Academic selection is perceived in Scotland as something very different from selection based on aptitude and ability for dance, music and so on. Will not the hon. Gentleman put his definition on the record even at this late hour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have already had a debate on academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin. I note that the hon. Member for Fife, Central did not table one amendment to achieve what he says could be achieved. We look forward with enthusiasm to Report stage when he will have a second chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray asked me about the use of the regulations. I can go even further towards meeting what she asks for than she might think proper. I should like to think that education authorities reading the speeches of Opposition Members and the comments of the hon. Lady will decide that there is a great deal of consensus and that they will be happy and willing to introduce the testing that we propose at primary 4 and primary 7 in the subjects of English and maths without the Secretary of State having to use the powers that we are taking under clause 63. That would be the preferred course of action. Therefore, when the hon. Lady asks whether we intend to extend the powers to other stages in the school year, my intention would be to hope to persuade the education authorities to go forward without the powers having to be used. I would not have thought that that was possible until our debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason why the powers are necessary is that the hon. Member for Fife, Central and the EIS have argued that teachers should boycott such a scheme and have made it clear that they would seek to frustrate the introduction of testing of this sort. Therefore, it is necessary to have a power to ensure that what the vast majority of parents want—and what it would appear the majority of the Committee wants—goes into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I have no hesitation in suggesting to the hon. Member for Dumbarton that he withdraw his amendment because it is clear that if the Committee did not know what was meant by diagnostic assessment, we would be putting the courts in an intolerable position if we were to accept such an amendment. I have a clear idea of what diagnostic assessment means, and I hope that I have demonstrated to the Committee that it would be inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the debate was not too esoteric, and I apologise to the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) that educational terms were flying about in the first part of the debate. The nub of the argument is that the Minister has given us no proof as to why he is introducing the assessment techniques. If he was looking at the present system and saying, "We're going to build on it," or, "The present system is deficient," that would be fine. There has been no exhibition of that. It is a mentality of "Take it or leave it; we are going to do it and nobody is going to stop us." In the light of that, I will not withdraw the amendment and will press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that this has been an exceptionally good debate in terms of the serious nature of the subject. However, the Minister ended up with a view of consensus which I do not share. Our reservations have been heightened by the Minister's latter remarks about testing and the use to which it could be put. The debate has been technical and definitions have been made. That can lead to confusion and to some people trying to distort what has been discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife's system is markedly different from the Minister's future view of testing and its use. The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) raised the issue of the physical manifestation of the process. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) also contributed. It then transpired that we were considering what would happen to the average nine-year-old, and we also discussed—the Minister did not respond to this—the form in which parents would receive the information on the national Scottish norm for nine-years-olds studying mathematics, English, science and other subjects. That is a recipe for chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons people are opposed to normative national testing based on standardised items are threefold. First, it will pit child against child and lead to conflict, especially if sensitive material is given to parents—as most people seem to accept it will— and to school boards. It will then become public information. Children will feel threatened and insecure and the league tables, which people only formerly feared, will become a reality. That may be a harsh assessment of the Minister's words, but what will be on offer until the next election will not be acceptable to the majority of Scottish parents, the education authorities and the much-criticised teaching unions and associations which have also made major contributions. What distresses me is the use to which the national standardised testing will be put. The Minister was saved from dealing further with the question of academic selection when he suggested that it would not be appropriate to make a judgment on the primary 7 tests. That will be a matter for later debate. However, the Scottish people fear that the primary 7 test could be used to introduce academic selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why people are opposed to the new system is the centralisation of education that it involves. Why will the Scottish Office's wisdom be forced down the throats of every education authority in Scotland? The Minister shakes his head, but clause 63 is remarkable. It provides that the Secretary of State will do various things, that there will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1363</span>
consultation and that his decision will be introduced by regulation. The Minister made an acidic comment and said that if the education authorities did what he said there would be no need for regulation. That is remarkable and shows a lack of faith and trust in education authorities, such as Fife, which do remarkable work with diagnostic testing. The Minister is laughing. I was pleased that he had some kind words to say about Fife, but he will do Fife no favours with the sinister elements that lie behind the nationally standardised testing system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I laugh because the hon. Gentleman insists on describing Fife's system as diagnostic testing. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) accepted that diagnostic testing was used for a child with learning difficulties to identify the source of the problem and to put it right. How can he describe the tests set to all children as diagnostic? Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that every child in Fife has a particular learning difficulty that needs to be explored using diagnostic tests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the time and the contributions that other hon. Members wish to make, I shall not indulge the Minister. It might be useful if he and his advisers were to accompany me on a visit to Fife, if that is not too humble a pastime. One of Fife's interesting features is that it has enrichment programmes and youngsters who are exceptional achievers are given more preferences in a mixed ability system. That covers all eventualities. Diagnostic testing is important because children and parents in Fife are not interested in what happens in Strathclyde, Grampian or Tayside—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tut, tut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). I should have said Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents are interested in the school, the education authority and the provisions already made. The sum and substance of the Minister's final comment can lead people only to believe that the Government are creating further conflict in education authorities. The press will be allowed to get hold of league tables of schools' attainments and performances. The position will be increasingly unstable. That is a tragedy, and I deplore the Minister's objective for the future of Scottish education. Many education authorities will have to look long and hard at what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier I talked about the inconsistency of diagnostic testing in Scotland. The Government would be better served by doing some thorough research, not only into what parents want, but into the sort of testing and assessment systems currently operational in Scotland. The Government do not accept that there is a great deal more to be done before a national standardised system can be introduced. There is apprehension and fear. Fife and other authorities carry out diagnostic testing, but all that could be lost if we have the sort of testing that the Government want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in our interests to make it clear that we deplore the national standardised testing system that is being
	<span class='label label-info column'>1364</span>
adopted by the Government and which, through regulation, is to be imposed on every major education authority. That is undemocratic. It is inefficient for child development and the possible contribution that children will make to the economy of Scotland. It is chaotic. It is a bizzare view of life. It is a highly politicised view of Scottish education. We shall continue to oppose the distinctive nature of the Government's proposals and to support the excellent work being done by the many education authorities that seek to put children first and politics second. We reject much of what has been described as nationalised standardised testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the speech of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). He is trying to justify himself too much in opposing the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not think that a parent, teacher or young person in my constituency could imagine that the setting of examinations by the Scottish Examination Board was centred on the political person of the Secretary of State for Scotland. I have never heard that suggested before, whoever was Secretary of State for Scotland, I do not fear political centralisation, which was the nub of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I have confidence in the impartiality and independence of the Scottish Examination Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is slightly wrong in saying that parents and others in education are interested only in what happens within their own region. He may be right that that has been the case until now, but there is an increasing interest in what is happening elsewhere, partly as a result of some of the Government's proposals, not all of which I agree with. They have heightened the awareness of parents, teachers and educationists and created more interest across Scotland in what is happening in different areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School boards are an example. People in Grampian could not understand why school boards were necessary because school councils operate effectively. It was interesting to people in Grampian to learn that other areas of Scotland did not have school councils. An understanding why the Government introduced legislation on school boards emerged. It is good to have that awareness across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New organisations, such as Education Alert which started in my part of Scotland, have arisen from a realisation among those genuinely interested in education that there should be more co-operation across Scotland on how education is organised and what standards are reached. I hope that parents will take an interest in centralisation, testing and comparisons between the regions of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the wisdom that the right hon. Gentleman contributes to the Committee. Will he tell us whether he is satisfied about the use to which such testing will be put?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to turn to that. I was dealing with two points that the hon. Gentleman made, with which I did not agree. He was straining to find points of opposition to my hon. Friend the Minister.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1365</span>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we have had a good debate on the clause. I had genuine reservations, but not about the principle of testing. That does not worry me. I have no objection to the use of testing to set standards so that a child's attainment can be set against a norm. I strongly support that, but I am worried about the use to which the results of the tests will be put. I do not want them to become a matter of life and death at different points of a child's progress through school. The debate has been extremely useful as the Minister gave me that assurance. He was forthcoming and made it absolutely clear that the tests should not be used for that purpose. I accept that. We have made enormous progress in our discussions on this important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found the debate useful because I have obtained more information. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) did not take it in the same spirit. The Minister answered all her questions satisfactorily and dealt with her fears. There may be other reasons why she could not support the Government. At least she might have abstained when it came to the vote. I shall watch what she does when we vote on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at the way in which the Labour party voted on this matter. We have agreement across the Committee on the principle of testing. We had clarification from the Minister about how the system of testing will be set up and administered, about which many of us had reservations, and we had assurances about the use to which the results of testing would be put. I do not understand why the Opposition voted in favour of their amendment and why they are voting against the clause. They are making a strange political point that I find difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, even at this late stage, the Opposition will show greater interest in the core issues of education that affect everyone in Scotland. Perhaps just this once they will not seek to make a political point, but will accept the clause in the light of the Minister's explanations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is one thing that this sitting has clarified it is the fact that no one is against testing. At no point in the debate have we said that. We have merely discussed what form of testing we regard as appropriate. If Conservative Members have at last clocked that piece of information we are making progress. We have had a wide-ranging debate and I do not want to repeat arguments that have been well discussed, but other topics need a final hearing in the short time that remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to harbour a strange belief that the results of test will, when known to parents and teachers, remain secret, and that head teachers will not know them. Anyone who has worked in a school will know that that assumption is nonsense. Highly secret IQ test results were known to head teachers in secondary schools when children moved up from primary school, although it was all supposed to be secret and confidential. Head teachers will know the results of these tests as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1366</span>
The Minister said that national assessment would enable teachers to compare their pupils' performance with that of others in the nation, and so it will in a rough and ready manner. It will assume a reasonable notion of comparison between one school and another, but teachers will not compare the performance of Bearsden with that of Possilpark, even if Conservative Members are foolish enough to do so. Teachers will attempt to make comparisons based on common factors. A rough and ready comparison can be made, but at a price which will cause anxiety among young pupils that may produce adverse performance results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to believe that because there is no one great test day throughout the country pupils will not be anxious, but he forgets how young the children involved will be. Does he seriously believe that most pupils in this age range have the least idea whether the big test that they take one Monday morning is a national Scottish test, a test in their region or a test in their school? They will be told that it is a big, important test. Many of them will be emotionally strung up about it. To suggest that they will understand that it is a national test carried out on a local basis assumes far too much maturity for children of their age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not referred to clause 62 on the entry to technology academies. I expressed a great deal of worry about how it would be decided which pupils had aptitude for the academies. If the tests are to serve any purpose in determining where children take their secondary schooling, some information must be taken from the results to give teachers some idea of who is suited to such education, although the test will provide only an inadequate guide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the competitive atmosphere that will be created between pupils and between schools. I am sure that, ideologically speaking, Conservative Members are far keener on individual competition than we are. We fear that it will affect the breadth of the curriculum and the work of teachers in primary schools. Less attention is likely to be paid to subjects that are not tested as teachers strive for good test results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do people who work in education, the teachers' unions and the General Teaching Council oppose the Government's proposals on methods of testing? They are the people who do the job and they know what they are talking about. They do not need to act upon briefs provided by civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents will readily grasp the import of the news of where their children are placed in the bands that record the highest and lowest attainment levels. On hearing that her child is in band 7 out of the seven possible bands, a mother will not find it hard to conclude on the child's ability. The Minister has failed to deal with the next step of how parents are supposed to know where to go from there. The hon. Gentleman said that he would welcome their call for greater resources and so would I, but the point must be made that, in general, parents do not make the kind of demands that I would urge them to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have served as councillors will acknowledge that although people come to complain about housing repairs and a lack of adequate housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1367</span>
for rent, they hardly ever complain about problems in schools Hardly ever will parents visit a school to complain, but they should be ready to do so. It is part of their democratic right to complain about any problems. Many parents whose children derive bad results from such tests will blame the children by concluding either that they are not working, which may be true, or that they have been inadequately taught. Some parents will react with anger and others with resignation, but if they had not achieved much when they attended school they may conclude that the bad results are due to heredity and that will be the end of the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is that the idea of getting those results, making them known to parents and so on will be another way in which middle-class parents will push for advantage for their children while working-class kids fall to the bottom of the heap. When the Minister attempts to out-democrat the Opposition on the subject of parents' rights, he is really saying that he wants parents of the type whom he represents to get an advantage over parents who have not received much from the education system and do not expect much from it for their children. That is the truth of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall participate briefly in this stand part debate mainly because of the challenge thrown out by the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). The right hon. Gentleman seems determined to allocate my constituency as part of the Highland region, but it stops at Moray district and does not stray over to Nairn although people from there write to me occasionally because the constituency is regularly referred to by its pre-1979 title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not convinced by one or two of the more philosophical parts of the issues that I raised with the Minister. Clear answers were given about primary assessment being used to produce tests, how much it would cost and so on, but I was not convinced by his answer on how comparisons will eventually be made between different schools and different regions in Scotland. I do not believe that I have been especially obtuse this afternoon, but no straightforward answers were given to my questions how those test results would all come together, how the comparisons would be made and how access to that information would be restricted. Surely, clear restrictions would need to be placed on the collated information or will only the Scottish Examination Board study the overall pattern? Will it be the inspectorate, the Association of Head Teachers or some other body? I am not satisfied with the answers to those questions. That caused me genuine worry, which was why I felt pushed to support the amendments that we debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken about my knowledge of the operation of tests in schools, especially in secondary schools, and I do not think that there is any broad disagreement on the concept of testing. It is the use to which the results are put that is disputed and that needs clarification. I look forward to reading the Minister's response in the 	<i>Official Report</i> because it may be possible to refer to some items on Report to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1368</span>
make sure that there is a categorical assurance about the confidentiality of those results, on which so much is at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he expected the Scottish Examination Board to come up with clearly understood and unambiguous guidelines on an expected level of attainment. No one basically disagrees with having an expected level of attainment, but the Scottish Examination Board is perhaps being asked to define or to achieve the impossible. Such issues have concentrated the minds of educationists over many centuries. If there is to be an expected level of attainment, surely the clause should contain a method of evaluating the progress of the tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tests cannot stand still. They must reflect changing circumstances and developments in education. I find it amusing that we constantly refer to the examination paper of 1883, which would be completely inappropriate now. I do not suggest that within the space of five or 10 years education changes as radically as it has in the century since the paper was set, but surely in striving towards the definition of a certain level of attainment we must find a way of evaluating the constant changes in education. No reference has been made to that aspect.

The Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum has established five review and development groups to prepare draft curriculum guidelines and general advice on assessment policy for the five to 18-year-old age group. It would have been better to leave this part of the Bill until the groups reported. Once the information was readily to hand we could have debated against a more informed background. The groups are working extremely hard and, I believe, will come up with interesting recommendations. I hope that when the proposals come before us we shall have a further opportunity to explore the implications of curriculum and assessment in our primary schools in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many members of the Committee, I feel that this has been an interesting and enervating debate. I have enjoyed it immensely because we have spoken clearly about education issues. Some hon. Members have complained that the Committee does not say enough about children, but the whole of the previous debate was dedicated to our children's needs and aspirations, so I hope that some of the criticisms can be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Matin, and to the Committee for my absence earlier today. I was in Northern Ireland visiting the city of Derry— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—or Londonderry, for those Conservative Members who do not know what Derry is. Today's sittings have obviously been very interesting. I hope that that had nothing to do with the fact that I was absent for most of the day. I was certainly surprised to hear talk of consensus between both sides of the Committee. When I left the Committee on Thursday I should have thought there was as much hope of consensus at our sittings as there is between the nationalist and Unionist communities in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consensus is that children's interests must be placed first. I have been in Committee to hear the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1369</span>
debate for only just over an hour but, unlike the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), I was not convinced by the Minister's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was too late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in Committee to hear the Minister give the answers to which the right hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Others of us have been here since 4.30 pm and have listened to the whole debate. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the record and reflects on what to do tonight. Perhaps he would do better not to vote tonight and to read the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should certainly follow that advice if the hon. Member's colleagues had followed such a course last week when the guillotine motion was discussed. But those who were not in the Chamber at any time during that debate voted to guillotine our Committee proceedings. I believe that about 250 did so. Did the hon. Gentleman advise his hon. Friends not to vote on that occasion? No, he did not. He cannot be selective in his advice. If he is consistent when offering advice, people will take him more seriously than I take his last intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the part of the debate about whether the assurances given were sufficient. As I recall, it was said that clarification was provided about how the test will be administered. I was present when the Minister mentioned the Scottish Examination Board, how the test items would be drawn up and that everyone would be satisfied with that. No Opposition Member has suggested otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said that assurances had been given about the purposes to which the test results would be used, but I did not hear those assurances from the Minister. I heard something entirely different. Indeed, I agree with the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) who said that it was not a straightforward answer and that she had many doubts about what the Minister had said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I recall, the Minister said that parents were to know how a child was progressing against an average level of performance in Scotland in reading, mathematics, and so on. He said that parents should know what level their children had attained at the age of eight in reading, mathematics and so on. He mentioned that a new report card would set down levels of attainment against national standards which children would be expected to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside pressed the Minister and asked him how those national standards would be achieved. He specifically asked whether there would be a period of testing and collation of results that would then be used to establish a national norm. The Minister's reply caused me to wonder about the reliability of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1370</span>
the assurance. He said that the Government are statistically examining, over a period of time, how to establish national norms. He even referred to the results produced for school boards as perhaps forming the basic data of that statistical analysis in respect of national norms to be applied across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then started to swing away from that. He said that five different curriculum review groups are currently examining various aspects of the curriculum and that they will establish the levels that pupils will be expected to attain. The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside suggested that they were not talking about norms but about targets. The Minister immediately latched on to that and agreed that they were speaking about targets, not norms. I was not convinced, and I am surprised that someone as experienced as the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside was taken in by the Minister's unsure performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be honest with us. What is it to be? Is it to be a target level that is identified by experts in the curriculum review groups or a target level that will be established through norms that are arrived at by collating information from national tests across Scotland? The Minister has not made clear, while I have been in Committee, which it is to be. Indeed, his right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside did not even press him on that—he is glad to get off the hook and to vote for the Government as often as he possibly can. Perhaps he has reawakened an ambition for high office and wants to get back into the good books, but I was not convinced, and was very surprised, that the right hon. Gentleman was taken in by the Minister's performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister identified one problem— the inconsistency between schools in developing assessment policies. He said that the problem should be tackled. But surely the way to do that is to establish national advice and to encourage schools to develop proper assessment policies. The answer is not simply to introduce national standardised testing for every school in Scotland. That cannot be the way to proceed, yet that is what the Minister suggests. I strongly believe that parents are opposed to such testing. As I mentioned before, I was at a meeting in Lawside academy in Dundee which was called by the school council there. In the general discussion on school boards, the subject of national testing arose. The parents were universally hostile about national testing being imposed on children at primary levels 4 and 7. They would not accept it. Parents do not see testing in the same light as the Minister. I suspect that the Minister considers national testing as a means by which schools can be compared with other schools and academic selection can be reintroduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot shuffle away from the academic selection argument. The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) told the committee, honestly, that he wanted to use the legislation to reintroduce academic selection in schools in Scotland and the Minister congratulated him for making an excellent speech. Does the Minister agree with the hon. Member for Hexham? Does he want academic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1371</span>
selection reintroduced in Scotland? The Minister dodged that question, but he can answer it now by saying, "No, I want it used only for music and dancing and other very specialised subjects." But he will not say that because he consistently leaves his options open. He wants academic selection reintroduced and the way to do it is by national testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not how parents see it. They see only the intolerable pressure that national testing will put upon a child in primary 4 or 7. It is fine if a child passes the test, but what will happen if he or she fails? We are talking about a national, standardised test that all children in Scotland will sit at the same time. The results may be made available for purposes of which parents do not approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) was right when she said that children do not know whether it is a local authority or a national test. How, then, can the hon. Gentleman argue that the tests proposed in the clause will put children under intolerable pressure when the tests in Fife do not? Perhaps he thinks that the tests in Fife put children under intolerable pressure, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not present during the argument about Fife. I understand that Fife education authority's tests are nothing like the national tests that the Minister proposes. Every parent in Scotland will be aware that national testing is to be reintroduced in schools, that each pupil will be subjected to those tests and that the results may be put to uses of which they do not approve. That is the difference. The Minister must give the Committee a guarantee that the results of the tests will not be used to sort the sheep from the goats and make one child go to a self-governing school with academic selection and another to the education authority comprehensive. The Minister is skating round the issue. He might fool his hon. Friends on the Back Benches, but he does not fool the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that that fits in with the philosophy of the Bill? In each national test, the results will be used for children to gain access to self-governing schools or technology academies. It is an important part of the Minister's educational philosophy and he should be honest about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend is honest about such matters, unlike the Minister, who tries to keep his options open. He does not answer direct questions because he would have to give honest answers, so he avoids them or turns them round. There was a good example earlier when an hon. Member referred to diagnostic assessment. The Minister said that it was used only to identify learning difficulties. But he had said that diagnostic assessment identified levels of achievement against specified standards. That is not for discovering learning difficulties. That is an assessment that the Minister wants turned into normative testing so that children can be put into ranks of those who pass
	<span class='label label-info column'>1372</span>
and those who fail. The Minister must assure the Committee that that cannot re-emerge in Scotland. The results of any testing imposed in Scottish schools must be simply a means of improving a child's education. They must not be used to compare that child with anyone else at that or any other school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) would have benefited from listening to our debate. I am not being unreasonable when I suggest that he reads the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings, because his arguments were raised during those discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman left me completely puzzled. He seemed to be arguing that the tests would put children under pressure, but he did not explain why tests that are much more extensive will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) asked how attainment targets and objective criteria for the stages in primary education would be identified. We have commissioned a major development programme which covers all the five to 14 stages and every aspect of the curriculum. That draws on the experience of teachers and head teachers and proceeds from the identification of good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention throughout the development programme is to identify and disseminate good practice as widely as possible. There is considerable agreement about the skills and abilities pupils should acquire, although it is difficult to state concisely what those abilities are and how attainments at one stage of schooling relate to those at another. I believe that this can be done. We intend to define a number of levels of attainment, based on what experience shows pupils can achieve at a particular stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not overlooked the fact that in any age group it will be usual to find pupils whose current levels of attainment differ markedly from the average. Our aim is to ensure that each pupil is given work that is challenging but attainable. I do not underestimate the challenge that this poses but I am confident that it can be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East seemed to think that I was in a bit of a muddle when my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked me a difficult question. The hon. Gentleman said that I swung from one position to another. My right hon. Friend pointed out that there was difficulty in establishing norms based on performance without having the tests because we had no comparative data, and he asked how we would get going. The answer is by the establishment of attainment targets, such as those I have just explained, with which the development programme deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a number of years we shall have statistical information to provide a check. I am advised that the experience and expertise we have within the Scottish Consultative Committee on the Curriculum, and elsewhere, is such that the two marry up rather well and that it will be surprising if there are differences. Only time will tell whether my advisers are right. I do not believe that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has grasped that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>1373</span>
The clause is necessary to ensure that the Scottish Examination Board can administer primary testing through the primary assessment unit and that the Government can fund the board for that purpose. It allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to ensure that testing is introduced by all authorities, as the Government intend. National testing is no more than basic common sense. I believe that parents will support it. They have a clearer and better understanding of what we intend than many of the so-called educational experts who parade as our critics. They do no service to parents of Scottish children or to the Scottish educational community by indulging in what amounts to scaremongering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not preparing a return to the qualifying examination, or to some "Scotticised" form of the 11 plus. We have given assurances that the tests will not be used for the selection of pupils for particular schools or courses. The very nature of our proposals would be unsuitable for such a purpose. I hope that the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is listening, because he has an obsession about this. If self-governing schools wish to select children, it would be possible for them to set their own tests. That would be a far more sensible way of going about it than setting up a system of national testing, which the hon. Gentleman sees as some kind of hidden agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember the Secretary of State's words on the Floor of the House, which are in 	<i>Hansard.</i> He said that the Bill has nothing to do with selection. The Minister seems to imply that if opted-out schools so wish, they can set examinations. The Minister is now admitting that selectivity will be allowed, whereas the Secretary of State was at pains to say that there was nothing in the Bill about selectivity. The Minister's comments conflict with those of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, they do not. The Bill provides two hurdles that have to be overcome before selection can be introduced. If a school can overcome those hurdles, can obtain the endorsement or parents and the Secretary of State, and has some form of selection—perhaps for Gaelic, as was suggested to the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald)—it might need to introduce some form of test. If the hon. Member for Dumbarton is looking for evidence of hidden agendas, he will find that a dedicated test is a more suitable vehicle for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose the testing of key aspects of mathematics and English in relation to nationally agreed levels of progress and attainment. We propose that the tests should be set alongside the continuous assessment that all teachers should carry out to complement and inform, not to replace such assessment. The tests will not stand in isolation; they will be an integral part of a school's overall assessment policy and will flow naturally from the curriculum in language and mathematics. Our aim is not to pressurise children but simply to achieve
	<span class='label label-info column'>1374</span>
a more systematic and effective approach to the assessment of pupils' progress by introducing more consistency of purpose, expectation and quality in teachers' assessment. I believe that those principles will be welcomed in all quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence from the published reports of the inspectors shows clearly that there is a need for more consistent, systematic and effective assessment. The system that we shall develop will draw on the considerable experience and expertise that are available to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made clear our intention to devolve responsibility for the administration and maintenance of the system of national testing to a primary assessment unit, associated with the Scottish Examination Board. We contend that such an agency will have the necessary experience and expertise to manage a national system effectively and that it will enjoy the confidence of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing sinister about the extension of the regulation-making powers of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. I noted the astonishment of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) at the terms of the clause. Section 2 of the 1980 Act empowers the Secretary of State to prescribe
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Standards and general requirements to which every education authority shall conform".</p></blockquote>
So the powers of the Secretary of State go beyond the power that we are taking here. We have consistently made it clear that we want to proceed by agreement, not by legislation. That is why specific powers for primary testing are not sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain committed to the traditional processes of consultation and discussion, but it would be a failure of good Government if, at the end of the day, we could not ensure that national testing was introduced in an orderly and consistent manner throughout the country. I fully expect that it will be done without statutory intervention, but it is only common prudence to see that the necessary powers are in reserve, in case they should prove helpful in getting testing properly implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the clause to the Committee. If Opposition Members object to the use to which the information will be put, I can only say that the debate rests with the education authorities and that they should be reassured by the undertakings that I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour members, will not vote against the clause, but I wish to put on record our reason for not doing so. The clause does not specify the nature, extent or purpose to which the testing will be put, but it would be foolish to vote against what is an empty clause in relation to a piece of enabling legislation. We are in no way moved by the Minister's assurances. We do not believe that national standardised testing will be popular in Scotland, especially among parents. Our reservations remain. We await with interest what happens in the dialogue and consultation on the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
