	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 1</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>THE SCHEME OF GOVERNMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 90, in page 50, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"The member of staff shall have the right to be represented by a member of their professional association or trade union, a colleague or a friend at any hearing conducted by the board of management or any persons authorised under the articles of management".—	<i>[Mr. McLeish]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about problems of child-centred education, as highlighted by the Church, and difficulties in industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 deals with the dismissal of staff and I have already mentioned the atmosphere and tension in schools that arise when such issues are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are worried about teacher dismissal, which will be discussed when we debate the abolition of section 88 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. When obstacles to dismissal and protection of employees are removed, every affordable opportunity should be given to an employee to have his case heard sympathetically. That is why amendment No. 90 seeks to firm up this schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone further than suggesting that a member of staff facing dismissal should have the right to be represented by a professional association or trade union, and have suggested representation by a colleague or friend, which must evoke a sympathetic response from the Government. But comments made in a wider industrial relations sense suggest that trade unions may not be allowed to operate in a self-governing school. At present, teaching unions have members in the independent sector. Will self-governing school boards be able to dispense with professional associations and trade unions representing manual employees? As employment rights have been generally eroded over the past decade, the amendment has a particular poignancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2(e) of the Articles of Management in part II of the schedule deals with dismissal. Other problems within a school will have to be tackled, and, I would like to think that that is a general resume of what may happen and that there will be a further tightening of the specific aspects of procedure to which anyone would be exposed either to be disciplined or dismissed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a straightforward amendment. Its technical construction may be rather familiar, but we hope
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>416</span>
that at the appropriate time much later this evening the Minister will be able to comment on it. The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was successful earlier. It was not accepted graciously by everyone, but after the Division we achieved a significant little change to the Bill. I look forward with interest to the ensuing debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it would be helpful to intervene now and respond to the amendment because there may be a misunderstanding about it. Under section 6 of the Employment Protection Act 1975 there exists a code of practice, made by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service and issued by order of the Secretary of State for Employment, covering disciplinary practice and procedures in employment. Paragraph 10 of that code specifies in considerable detail the requirements of a disciplinary procedure. It specifies, for example, that disciplinary procedures should be in writing, should specify to whom they apply and should provide for matters to be dealt with quickly. They should also indicate the disciplinary actions which may be taken, provide for individuals to be informed of the complaints against them and be given an opportunity to state their case before decisions are reached. The code also specifies that disciplinary procedures should give individuals the right to be accompanied by a union representative or by a fellow employee of their choice, which is the gist of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code is a code of good practice which any employer ought to follow—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), any employer would disregard it at his peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, if an employee is dismissed, and it is found by the tribunal to which he appeals that the code of practice had not been followed in some particular, that would be ground for treating the case as unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As employers, the board of management of a self-governing school will be subject to the same legal provisions as any other employer, no more and no less. I accept that what lies beyond this amendment is reasonable, but it is not necessary to insert it in the Bill. If we were to do so we might as well insert the entire AC AS code of practice as something which should be embodied in every school's scheme of Government. That, too, would be unnecessary. In particular, it would not give the staff of the school any greater measure of real protection than they enjoy under existing legislation. The Secretary of State could not, for instance, order the reinstatement of a member of staff. We really have to trust these bodies to be able to make decisions in the real world: they are boards of management, not puppets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say, however, that a newly established board will be left completely alone to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
discover basic facts about employment law for itself. This is the kind of matter on which the Department could properly issue guidance from time to time and I have no doubt that we shall do so. I have noted from what the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that we ought to make sure that one of the points we draw to the ttention of boards of management is the existence of this code of practice and its significance for them. We shall do that. But there is no necessity, nor indeed would it serve any useful purpose, to incorporate the detail in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that helps the Committee, as it shows that what lies behind the amendment is covered by existing employment law. I hope that that will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment so that we can proceed with further consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say. He referred to the Employment Protection Act 1975, which includes the right of any employee who is subject to disciplinary proceedings to be accompanied. What is the exact terminology of that Act? Does it correspond exactly with the terminology in the amendment? It would be interesting to know whether the Employment Protection Act 1975 gives a staff member the right to be accompanied by a representative of his professional association or trade union, a colleague or a friend at any hearing conducted by the board, or whether that Act differs on that entitlement. The Minister should make it clear whether the amendment would strengthen the rights of staff members subject to a disciplinary hearing in relation to the 1975 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also argued that an employer would ignore the Employment Protection Act 1975 at his peril because that would be grounds for an industrial tribunal reaching a decision of unfair dismissal. If an employer ignored the right of the person to be accompanied at the disciplinary hearing by whoever he wished, would that be sufficient grounds for a decision of unfair dismissal? What powers would an industrial tribunal have to impose such a decision on the board of management of a self-governing school? Would the board of management be able to ignore that decision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is anxious to cut the debate short and not allow the Committee to explore fully whether the Bill interferes with the rights of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that boards of management should be given some independence and that it would not be right for the Secretary of State for Scotland to insist that boards of management allow such representation at dismissal proceedings. That suggests that industrial tribunals can safely be ignored by boards of management of self-governing schools without any repercussions. The Minister used the phrase "at his peril", but what does that mean? If the board of management ignored an industrial tribunal, what would happen to that board and to the person who took the case to the tribunal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister has no intention of strengthening the rights of people who are subject to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>418</span>
dismissal proceedings. The Bill gives wide powers to boards of management. Earlier we debated whether boards of management should be allowed to contract out school meals, cleaning or janitorial services. It was made clear that the boards of management could go for the cheapest option, thereby releasing more money for other educational needs. I quizzed the Minister about whether boards of management would be tied to the standards and requirements laid down by education authorities on privatisation. He made it clear that they would not be bound by such standards and could set their own standards. Therefore, they could allow low pay, interfere with people's rights to sick pay and use private contractors to impose such conditions. If a person were unfairly dismissed by the private contractor, would the board of management have any responsibility for that person? Would he be covered by the Employment Protection Act 1975 and would he have any recourse to the board of management? I hope that the Minister will answer those important questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we hear from Conservative Members is rhetoric. The Government and Conservative Back-Bench Members have no interest in protecting the rights of individuals, especially those who are members of trade unions. Time and again we have heard the bias—it is almost paranoia—that exists among Conservative Members when they mention the EIS or any other trade union. They are in favour of trade union rights almost everywhere else in the world, notably in Poland, but they oppose us when we try to apply the same standards to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just come from the Floor of the House where another atrocious attack on trade union rights has taken place in the form of the proposed abolition of the national dock labour scheme. Many Conservative Members of the Committee were baying like animals and cheering—[Hon. Members: "Yes."]—during that statement. That shows their attitude. Therefore, when the Minister says that the amendment does not matter because it is covered by the Employment Protection Act 1975, we know that we should not believe him. The Minister is trying to pull a fast one and we need clear assurances that the protection that the amendment seeks will apply. Boards of management must be made to obey, if not the industrial tribunals, the Secretary of State for Scotland who will insist that trade union rights are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have served on many Committees on Scottish legislation. I think that you, Mr. Hogg, and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Sprinburn (Mr. Martin) were in the Chair for the Housing (Scotland) Bill. On that Bill the Government were not keen to protect the tenant. They wanted the balance to be weighted in favour of the landlord. Similarly, on this amendment, the Government want the balance of advantage to lie with the employer rather than with the employee, who may be in breach of disciplinary rule. That is unfortunate. The Government and their supporters give authority and backing to the individual who is able to use the capitalist system to exploit others. The exploited, who suffer as a result
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
of the other's self-interest, are denied any protection. The Government do all that they can to ensure that the weak are left undefended and that the powerful are made stronger. That concept lies at the heart of the Bill. The better off, who live in nicer areas, can put themselves outside the education authority system by offering higher salaries to attract better staff. That means that the better off will be able to obtain better standards of education than anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suspect that the Minister when he says that the amendment is not necessary. It is vital that he accepts it. Even though the Minister does not appear to be paying attention, they are important points. The Minister referred to sections of the Employment Protection Act 1975, but I do not know whether the relevant parts are available to Committee members. We should be able to read them before we accept any promises from the Minister on the position of employees. We do not know whether to trust the Minister, and it would be useful if that material were available so that we could check it for ourselves instead of the Minister springing it on us and asking us to accept his word. Experience of earlier debates shows us that the Minister's word cannot be accepted easily. He says one thing at one sitting, but at the next he misrepresents what he said before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Can the Committee have copies of the Act so that we can study it in detail? It will affect the way in which we handle the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not mentioned in the amendment, so it would not be appropriate for that material to be available in the Vote Office and the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have asked whether copies of the code of practice could be put on the Table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether that is perestroika or glasnost, but the Minister is providing the necessary information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Would it be appropriate for you to suspend the Committee for an hour or two while we receive and consider the Act? It might speed up the debate. We could perhaps consider the Act, accept what the Minister has said and move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How it is possible to speed up a debate by stopping it is beyond me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I shall explain how it is possible. If the Committee is suspended until we have read the document, we might accept what the Minister says and be able to wind up the debate in five or 10 minutes. If it is not suspended we might have to introduce further points for the Minister to answer. In that way the Committee could drag on into the early hours of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman might have something to say about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am a new Member of the House. Would it be possible for me to move a 15-minute adjournment as there are so few Conservative Members here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but he does not have the power to move an adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a clear sign of the rights and wrongs of the order of the business that we are trying to conduct this afternoon. It is interesting that the Minister has said that the documents are in the Library and that he has tried to make copies available to the Committee. One has just been handed to me at this very moment, but I have not yet developed the facility to of reading and speaking at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend like to sit down? I could ask for information while he reads the document. Would that be in order, Mr. Hogg?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that he intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He cannot ask me a question in the middle of that intervention. The convoluted procedures that he is recommending to the Committee leave me aghast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. It is what is known as—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman had not raised a point of order. He intervened on the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps in my intervention I can explain what I was doing. It is known as a body swerve. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East is very knowledgeable about employment protection—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend questions that with his rather whimsical use of the word "me". Perhaps it should have been "I". He is trying to read and digest the document at this very moment. Does he think that it will provide the necessary protection for teachers, as the Minister said? Has he finished it yet? If he has, I shall sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying desperately to read this five or six-page document. I have found a paragraph entitled "Essential Features of Disciplinary Procedures". I have not yet reached the part that says whether the disciplinary procedures are imposed on employers under the Employment Protection Act 1975 or whether it is merely suggested that employers follow them. The Minister has yet to make clear to the Committee what sanctions will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
be used under that Act to ensure that boards of management adhere to the essential features that are described in the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being unfair to the Minister. I think he said that there was a code of conduct. The boards of management may or may not wish to call it that; it is simply a matter of good practice. As usual, he was imploring us to trust him. If they failed to follow it, action could be taken through the court. I am dubious about that. As I understand it, there is absolutely no obligation to follow that code of practice—they could choose to ignore it should they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a worrying observation. If the document is simply a code of practice, there is nothing to prevent a board of management from deciding that it should be callously ignored in dealing with disciplinary matters affecting its staff. Under the proposed management structure, on paper the boards of management will have a majority of elected members. However, in reality it will be able to establish a sub-committee structure and appoint not only co-opted members—perhaps exclusively—but people who are neither co-opted nor elected on to the board of management. In theory, any board of management could set up a special sub-committee to deal with disciplinary matters and appoint to it people who have no relationship with the board of management either in an elected or a co-opted capacity. That causes me great anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local employers may have a particular expertise and a board of management may decide that it would be a good idea to invite two or three of them to sit on a disciplinary sub-committee and impose on the staff the sort of discipline that it wished to see. Suppose a woman teaches in a school and her husband works in a local factory. Suppose he happens to be the convenor of shop stewards in that factory and is in continual conflict with his employer so that there is a great deal of bad feeling between them? The board of management of a self-governing school might decide that that employer should be put in charge of a disciplinary sub-committee. The wife of the man whom he dislikes intensely, who works at the school as a teacher—or a cleaner or janitor— might be treated unfairly by the chairman of the subcommittee who is her husband's employer and has an intense personal dislike of her and her husband. She would get short shrift from that sub-committee. We seek some guarantee that would protect her rights as far as they can be protected under law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has suggested that those rights would be protected under the Employment Protection Act and the code of practice which is available to employers. But the Minister himself concedes that it is an entirely voluntary code of practice. The employers could ignore it and ensure that when the woman was summoned before a disciplinary hearing of the sub-committee of the board of management she was not allowed to be represented by her trade union or her professional association or to ask whether a friend, colleague or even her husband could come along with her to represent her and help her to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
put her case. The board of management would be able to get away with that under the Minister's proposal. He does not want to strengthen the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that although it is a voluntary code of practice, it could be used as a basis to raise a complaint through an industrial tribunal. But if the employee took the matter to an industrial tribunal and it considered the case, the Minister has not said whether the fact that she was not allowed to be accompanied at the hearing would be sufficient grounds for a decision of unfair dismissal. Even if it were sufficient grounds, how would the industrial tribunal impose its decision against the board of management and make it come into line? Would it have to reconstitute the hearing? Would it have to bring the woman back into employment? What sort of powers does an industrial tribunal have in that area? That has not been explained.

The voluntary code of practice covers many items. It states that any complaint against the member of staff must be in writing, but anyone would expect that as a very minimum. No one would expect an employee to be dismissed simply by word of mouth. The complaint would have to be specified so that he would at least know of what he was accused. The code says that the person to whom the complaint applies must be specified but that is no great concession. It is inconceivable that someone could be sacked because an allegation was made against an unidentified person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend muse on whether that code of practice was used at Jordanhill school when its rector was dismissed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say, from direct experience, what happened in the case of the Jordanhill school rector, but I know that he found himself in conflict with the board of management— or whatever it was called—that ran that school. However, such a case could easily arise. A school's name could be trawled through the newspapers and its reputation put at risk because of allegations and counter-allegations between an employee and a board of management.

If we are to set up legislation that brings self-governing schools into existence, we must ensure that the procedures that govern matters such as disciplinary hearings of members of staff are dealt with sensitively, and that every option is covered. We must not allow tremendous conflicts to arise between the board of management and employees, because the affair could be dragged through the media, the school's reputation besmirched and the children's educational opportunities diminished as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister is keen to bring this debate to a halt, he has answered none of the central questions. His earlier intervention gave me no assurance that employees would have undeniable rights to be accompanied by whoever they wish at a disciplinary hearing under the board of management

system. Therefore, the Committee should explore the matter further and persist with the amendment until the Minister gives us a much clearer assurance about the rights of employees who may find themselves at the mercy of boards of management in the new self-governing schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I approach all amendments with an open mind and am always prepared to listen to any arguments, whether they are for or against an amendment. The arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) were powerful and persuasive, whereas the Minister's arguments were noticeably weak and relied on thefact that the code of practice would make the amendment redundant. If that is so, why do education authorities' disciplinary procedures, agreed with the various teacher associations, include the stipulation that is contained in the amendment? They allow any teacher threatened with dismissal to be accompanied at a disciplinary hearing by a colleague, friend, or member of his trade union to help him make his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the provision is already in the code of practice, why have the education authorities found it necessary to include it in their disciplinary procedures? The Minister's arguments show why it was necessary and why it is also necessary to include the provision in the Bill. First, he argued that it was redundant, as it was already in the code of practice, and that if we were to repeat the contents of the code of practice, it would take up another sheaf of papers equivalent to the size of the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one wonders why any mention of the disciplinary proceedings are included in paragraph 2(d) and (e) of part II of the schedule if it is redundant. They set out various rights of individuals when faced with some sort of disciplinary matter, and require the self-governing school to include as part of its articles on management provisions dealing with disciplinary hearings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be nice and simple if the Government introduced an amendment that stated that the boards of management of self-governing schools shall adhere to the code of practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an excellent suggestion which I hoped to make myself later. It was the natural conclusion following from the arguments I was about to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we need to brush aside the Minister's weak rationalisation of why he had not included, and would not include, provisions such as those suggested in the amendment. The idea that the proposal is not necessary because it would be redundant is undermined by the fact that he has already included items in paragraph 2 of part II of schedule 1. Why are some redundant items written into the Bill, while others are excluded? The Minister's arguments are rather weak and desperate and show that some other motive, which he has not disclosed, is preventing him from accepting the amendment. I do not believe that he so lacks clarity of thought that he found his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
own arguments that convincing. The Government's part in the history of employees' rights, so ably set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, shows us why the Minister is unable to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that if such a provision were not followed through by a self-governing school's board of management, it would lead to that board of management being prone to challenge in the courts on the ground of unfair dismissal. That was exceedingly unclear. The Minister said that the code of practice was a cast-iron guarantee for someone to have the right of assistance from a trade union representative or any other colleague, but he then watered that down by saying that it was a code that a board of management, like any respectable employer, ought to follow. He did not say that the board must follow it to keep within the law, but rather that it should do so. He then went on to say that a board of management that failed to provide that right for an employee who faced disciplinary procedures would do so at its peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should it be at its peril? The Minister said that if the board did not give an employee the right contained in the code of practice, and his representations against those disciplinary procedures failed to carry conviction so that he was dismissed, the employee could have recourse to the courts to seek redress for unfair dismissal. The refusal of the board of management to allow him the right to be represented by a colleague or trade union official would be a matter that would be considered. The Minister did not say how that would happen but suggested that it would be taken into account in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what way would it be considerd? The key issue is whether the refusal of a board of management to offer such protection would be sufficient ground for the court to decide that the employee was unfairly dismissed. If that was merely one ground, the protection offered by the code of practice is nothing like as strong as the sort of protection that we seek in our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's theory that the code of practice makes the amendment redundant does not hold water. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on that. I must confess that I am a slow reader and did not get through all the pages when my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East was speaking. I have been unable to determine whether the refusal by a board of managment to the right of assistance or representation by a friend, colleague or trade union official in disciplinary procedures is a sufficient ground for the court to decide that there was unfair dismissal. There is a huge gulf between what might be a ground for unfair dismissal and a sufficient ground for unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, refusal of the right by a board of management would be a sufficient ground for unfair dismissal. An employee would have a secure, cast-iron guarantee that such a refusal would, of itself, justify a court finding that he was unfairly dismissed. That is, if an employee were dismissed and his rght to be represented at a disciplinary procedure, which is enshrined in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>425</span>
code of practice, is ignored, he would have recourse to the courts. Without the guarantee that the amendment would introduce, he would not know whether he had a cast-iron case. He would have to bring to the court's attention a series of other matters relating to his dismissal. Therefore, he would have to weigh matters carefully before deciding whether he would go to the court, and whether he could afford the time and expense of so doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons for our amendment is that we wish to protect the rights of all employees, especially those who are not trade union members. Such employees might be able to use the legal services of their unions to help them. Those who are, unfortunately, not trade union members must be protected against the terrible Bill that the Government have introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have that concern in mind too, which is why, under the amendment, a person who faces displinary procedure could be represented at a hearing by a colleague or a friend. We are sometimes accused of being tied to the apron strings of trades unions. That is certainly not true in my case. The amendment, by referring to a colleague or a friend as an option to a trade union representative, shows that we are interested in the rights not only of trades union members, but of all employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the arguments that have been advanced so far in the debate, I am inclined to the view that the amendment is necessary. That is especially so given, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said, that the Minister is now backtracking on his assurance that the board of management will have a democratically elected majority. Therefore, we are doubly concerned about the rights of individual employees and wish to ensure that they have every protection to which they are entitled. I shall listen with an open mind to the arguments of Conservative Members, particularly those advanced by the Minister. So far, his justification for the provision has been entirely invalid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. The Minister said that industrial tribunals can take action about the way in which dismissals were carried out. The code of practice states:
	<br><q><p>"the way in which a dismissal has been handled can be challenged before an industrial tribunal"</p></q>
and does not mention whether such action would necessarily be successful. It goes on:
	<br><q><p>"the employer may be ordered to re-instate"</p></q>
or compensate the employee. However, the document uses vague terms such as "may" and "can", not definite words, such as "will" or "must". The Minister did not deal with that important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that my hon. Friend is absolutely right, as I have not had a chance to read the document. He usually is on such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A new obstacle is to be put before people appealing to an industrial tribunal, in that a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
deposit of £150 may be necessary. Unless watertight safeguards are built into this provision, that will be an extra burden for a host of teaching and non-teaching personnel facing dismissal for spurious reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Unless an employee in a self-governing school has a cast-iron guarantee such as similar employees in education authorities have through agreements with teaching associations, he would not know whether a deposit would be required, if he took his case to a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to bring my remarks to a close. [Hon. Members: "Go on."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have spent a great deal of time today explaining on Grampian Television that it is no part of the Chairman's role to facilitate the passage of a Bill, but that his role is merely to ensure that consideration of it is conducted within the rules of debate. I hope that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) will not take the advice that he has been offered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was more naive than I am now, I may have taken the advice offered by Conservative Members, but now I know that they seek only to entrap me by a devious ploy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to press to the Minister the points that I made. He must come up with better arguments. It is not enough to say that safeguards are enshrined in the code of practice. Unless the fact that an employee who has been unfairly dismissed has not had proper representation is a sufficient condition, the code of practice does not give the same protection as the amendment would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's even weaker argument was that the amendment was redundant because the provision is already written in. I reiterate that that makes paragraph 2(d) and (e) of part II of schedule I equally redundant, but I am sure that the Minister will not agree with that statement. If the Minister is to convince me, his arguments must be better than those that he has advanced so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with incredulity to the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). My hon. Friend has had to describe why the Bill is so unsatisfactory and to spell out why it is essential for an employee facing disciplinary action to have the simple right to have someone accompanying him or her at a hearing. That borders on the farcical. Surely that is a readily understood point: it was understood and accepted for many years by the Conservative party until its ideology began to get completely out of hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To listen to Conservative Members one would think that disciplinary matters were simple to deal with. One needs only a limited experience of handling disciplinary matters, whether from the management or trade union side, to realise that they are not simple. All sorts of issues arise, but unfortunately the code of practice does not help. A simple document that sets out basic ideas on how to conduct disciplinary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>427</span>
matters is needed. It cannot cover everything, nor should it try to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, an employer must decide which actions deserve dismissal or a lesser penalty. That may not be the same for all employers, so disagreements arise between the unions and the employers about which actions warrant dismissal and which should be dealt with by a lesser penalty. The employer might draw up a list of actions that deserve dismissal because he considered it important for employees to realise what sort of actions could result in dismissal. Those representing employees will often argue that such a list is unhelpful because it leads people to believe that if they do something that is not listed they need not be dismissed for it. Such problems can arise all the time. Even when the employer wants to impose a lesser penalty he still must decide what it should be. Perhaps it should be an unpaid suspension in lieu of that dismissal and, if so, for how long? It could be an unpaid suspension for a day, a week or several weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is taking us through all the possibilities for the person being disciplined. However, the amendment is rather tightly written and refers to having a member of a professional association or trade union, or a colleague or friend at the hearing. If she confines her remarks to that area she will be in order; otherwise she is straying a trifle wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that I was straying, Mr. Hogg, because I was trying to explain the difficulties that the employer would have in deciding matters like that. I shall move on, but I am finding it difficult. The employee's representative would have to be useful to him and to have a reasonable knowledge of the employer's attitude on those issues. One cannot simply expect a group of people, however well-intentioned, who have no experience of personnel matters to be able to decide that an employer should be disciplined and what form that discipline should take. It could be difficult adequately to represent an employee in such a situation and to give due weight to that right to be represented. I hope that that keeps me in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a range of penalties which the board of management would need to know about, such as unpaid suspension, a warning to be placed on the employee's record, or a denial of an increment. Let us consider the problem of timekeeping. In some work places timekeeping is vital: people who work in schools must be relied upon to turn up on time, not just when they please. It could be difficult for both sides to decide at what level bad timekeeping warrants dismissal or some lesser penalty. The Minister is taking us into deep waters when he expects a group of inexperienced people to deal with those matters without even giving the employee the right to be represented. However well-intentioned these people are, if an employee is disciplined by them without having the right to be represented, he has very little chance of having his rights protected. That is why we have a personnel profession. That is why it is vital to have the right to be accompanied by a representative at the hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
I agree with my hon. Friend's that a person should have the right to bring anyone he pleases, not necessarily a trade Union representative. Nevertheless, people should be persuaded that they would do better to join a trade union and have the expertise of a representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help them under this schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course it would. I am not arguing that every shop steward is the best possible advocate, but a trade union representative would give an employee a better chance than someone who was willing to help but did not know much about employment law. Because this is not a simple matter, the TUC runs classes for shop stewards to help them to deal with such problems. They cannot be dealt with by good will in ignorance of the law. Those courses should be funded appropriately and people should get access to them so that employees can be protected from unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to think that the ACAS code is sufficient. I wonder whether he has taken the trouble to read it because it clearly is not. Many small employers do not even know that it exists. Friends of mine who runs small businesses have asked me about disciplinary problems and I have advised them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that those on the board of Jordanhill school knew of its existence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. I cannot say whether they knew of its existence, but that is a good example of this problem. A group of well-intentioned citizens presumably wanted to run the school in the best way possible but made dreadful mistakes in their handling of a disciplinary matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady think it appropriate to bring up that case and make allegations which are wholly without foundation? There is no evidence that the board of management of Jordanhill acted improperly. It is unfair to those concerned to use that case in this debate— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members have made the point that they dissent from the Minister's remarks. I would like to hear what the hon. Lady has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most reasonable people would say that the people on that board, however well-intentioned, acted unfairly. I do not want to go into the case because I must protect the interests of that dismissed person, but it was widely reported at the time and many people thought that the matter had been handled badly. Clearly, we have a difference of opinion about that.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
Many small employers do not know that the code exists, and even if they do, it does not answer all the problems that might arise. How would the Minister feel about a board of management being invited to enter into a local agreement to improve upon that code? The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) suggested that the code should be adopted, but people may want to improve on the code by a local agreement and that is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code suggests that a person should have a reasonable length of time before his disciplinary hearing takes place. It is open to negotiation. That is important, it is not a technical detail. In the past, before progresive employment law was passed by a Labour Government, many employers dismissed out of hand employees who they found unsatisfactory with no notice and no right to a hearing. That was it. The employees were out the door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time factor is crucial. It enables the employee to gather evidence, find witnesses and prepare the best possible defence. It is especially important for a matter as serious as dismissal. In the current economic climate in many parts of Scotland, dismissal from a job means that a person is out of work for the rest of his life. It is no small matter to protect the length of time before a hearing takes place. The employee's chosen representatives should be able to assert the right to have sufficient time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the code does not set out who should hear a disciplinary case. Clearly, it will be someone in authority within the employer's organisation, but it must also be someone who has the time to devote to what could be a lengthy hearing. Often we hear of people, who are are inexperienced in such cases, thinking that it is all right to walk out when they have had enough, and wish to go to another meeting or go home to make the tea. They should stay to hear the whole case. In a complicated case it may take hours to discuss all the relevant issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. In the present climate, it might not be too much to suggest that industrial tribunals may be dispensed with as the Government further erode conditions for workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment does not remotely refer to anything of that nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. In his reply, the Minister referred to the code of practice. Is it not in order for us to discuss it when we deal with the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) invited the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) to comment upon the possible abolition of industrial tribunals. That does not form any part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be interesting to deal with my hon. Friend's question, but I accept your ruling, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not given thought to some other problems. Representatives of employees would need
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
to be aware of what standard of evidence is regarded as reasonable. Industrial tribunals have made it clear that employers need not operate a standard of evidence similar to that which exists in a court of law. Nevertheless, they have to be reasonably sure that the facts, as they understand them, are correct. Employers cannot rely on hearsay. They must make some attempt to ensure that what they consider to be the salient facts are true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the best will in the world, mistakes can be made. I hope not to try your patience, Mr. Hogg, but I shall briefly give an example of a genuine error that led to dismissal. A lorry driver employed by a Scottish local council was observed drinking from a can as he sped down the road. The employer assumed that he was drinking a can of lager and in his anger he took steps to dismiss the driver. However, the employee was later able to prove that he had been drinking a can of Coca-Cola. It was a natural mistake and is one which those inexperienced in personnel matters can easily make. The employee needs a representative, preferably a trade unionist, who has the experience to pick up that type of point and who could qustion the employer's witnesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) raises an important point that we have not tackled with specific reference to this amendment. Who will deal with industrial relations in a school that has opted out from the education authority, which has many people with intimate experience of such activities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to make that point. For want of any information given by the Minister, we must assume that circumstances will be similar to those of any fairly small employer although the numbers in a school could be substantial, particularly in a secondary school. The people chosen to conduct the disciplinary hearings will be those thought fit by the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it would be preferable if the group of people was always the same. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent employers from picking any three or four people who happen to be available on the day. There is nothing to protect the employee from such haphazard procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the west of Scotland drink-related problems are rife. It was frequently the case that an employee who drank at work or arrived at work drunk was dismissed. Recently, more progressive employers have had a policy of giving an employee with a drink problem the opportunity to overcome it with treatment. If a person is dismissed and thrown on the scrap heap he will never improve. The experience of Glasgow district council shows that many employees who had a drink problem were cured because of the council's progressive policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment as such does not provide for an agreement on alcoholism.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept your ruling, Mr. Hogg. I was trying to explain the type of problem with which inexperienced boards of management and representatives of the employee might have to deal.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on for hours because there are so many aspects to the problem. The group of people chosen by the employer to conduct the hearing might be well-intentioned, but not necessarily so. We all know of people who have been dismissed for no good reason, where their punishment has lacked balance and objectivity and was dependent on either their popularity with employers and colleagues or prejudices. Matters of religion, race or sex should be irrelevant to a proper disciplinary hearing, but unfortunately they come into the picture. That is why it is necessary to have a properly experienced employer's side to eliminate that factor and why it is vital that the employee's representative is aware of the possibility of such factors operating and how to deal with them effectively. He or she cannot simply go in raving and ranting and making accusation for which there is no proof; there must be an effective way to deal with such circumstances. If he or she fails to represent the person adequately and he gets dismissed anyway because of such prejudices operating, unfair assessment of the evidence and so on, the person will end up going to the industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the figures in front of me, but the vast majority of cases that go before industrial tribunals fail—not necessarily because they deserve to fail but because it is difficult under present employment law to get through tribunal. The law is designed to make most cases fail: that is the truth of the matter.

Finally, Mr.Hogg, I thank you for your suggestion. It has just occurred to me that tabling an amendment on the subject of alcoholism would be useful and I shall certainly follow your advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the rest of my hon. Friends I believe that the amendment is necessary and most reasonable. We are advocating co-operation between employers and employees. Like other amendments that we have tabled, its backbone is the democratic case, and I shall refer to that throughout my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the Employment Protection Act 1975 and the voluntary code of practice has its genesis in that Act. It is good to know that that Act remains as a legacy of that Government, given the subsequent aggressive Employment Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
We know what the Minister's intention is in establishing self-governing schools. There will be a free for all and schools will be floated off from the local authority, in addition to breaking the local authority link, the Government's action will also break the trade union link. That worries us, and that is why we have tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that collectivism has long been an anathema to the Government, but the principle behind it is important to the relationship between employer and employee, irrespective of which side of the divide one views it from. The Government's public agenda has been aimed at increasing freedom and choice. We submit that clauses such as this mean less freedom and choice, and they highlight the Government's private agenda, which is aimed at elevating greed and disregard for people to an art form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have given us scant information about how they will go about developing these policies. My experience of industry, and, in the short time for which I have been a Member of Parliament, of visiting industries and organisations in my constituency, show me that the most successful industries are those in which there is an understanding between the employer and the employee and between the management and workers. The Minister has not suggested that there will be any such understanding. The usual reason for success is that the relationship between employers and employees has a maturity that results in understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that the board of management can set up a sub-committee to appoint individuals who are not even elected to the board of management, never mind appointed to it. What is the Minister's opinion on that important point? Individuals appointed to a disciplinary sub-committee will be unfamiliar with the organisation on a day-to-day basis and have no experience of working with the school on a day-to-day basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend appreciate that the Minister is resisting the amendment, yet he has written into the Bill the right of boards of management to appoint whomsoever they wish to committees that deal with disciplinary hearings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's perspicacity is excellent, because I was just coming to that point. Those committees will be composed of members who have no normal acquaintance with the day-in-day-out experience of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned local employers who are unfamiliar with the position. In such a case, the head teacher will be in charge of industrial relations in the school. I make no criticism of head teachers in general, but many whom I have met have not excelled at industrial relations, simply because they have been teachers for 20 or 25 years, and have then been put in charge of an organisation. Their history has not been associated with management and social relationships in the employer-employee context, so that is an onerous burden on many head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
As a result of the Bill, the head teacher will be elevated to the number one position in industrial relations, but he will have no advice from individuals in the school. That problem is compounded by the fact that individuals from outside, who are not familiar with the circumstances, will be briefed only by the head teacher. In such cases, knowledge is power. Although the head teacher may be a reasonable individual, he or she will tell those from outside what has happened and say, "Trust me"—to use a phrase of the Minister's—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase I used was "trust the parents", not "trust me"—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Every time the Minister intervenes, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden feels obliged to assist him by embellishing what he has just said. Will he refrain from doing so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed this morning's debate because of the excellent remarks that you made, Mr. Hogg. I would abide by anything that you say. Your efforts to bring members of the Committee into line have my support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that knowledge is power. If a person appointed to a committee must be briefed only by a head teacher, he will be unable to get under the surface of what is happening. Like other organisations, schools are organic entities. If people are to accept the head teacher's word, guarantees to protect the rights of employees in schools should be written into the Bill. What we are suggesting is reasonable. We ask for someone to be represented by a trade union representative or a friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago I remember being asked to do something similar for a friend of mine whose husband had suffered a brain tumour. He had not been operated on by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), and he recovered fairly well. She had a complaint against the Greater Glasgow health board and she asked me along as a friend. This woman was fearful of going to the committee that morning, and my presence gave her the confidence to confront the array of dark-suited gentlemen who met her, and to put her case to the Committee. The same problem could arise with school boards, with individuals being left on their own, trying to convince a group of strangers of the merits of their case. The Government's proposal is far from adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jordanhill school has been mentioned, but as I do not know the details, I shall discuss only one general principle. The fracas that was caused by the Jordanhill case three or four days after the legislation came into force last April has been a dominant news story in the papers in Scotland, to the detriment of the school and individuals involved. Some would wish it had not occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given this wording, can the Minister guarantee that such cases will not recur, nor have such public
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
exposure? We must develop professional and sensitive procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going into the detail of that case, the person concerned was fully accompanied and represented, which is what the amendment is about. On the matter of it being a rather public and extended procedure, the governors were following the section 88 procedure, which later in the Bill we plan to abolish. Therefore, I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks, and I hope that he will support the Government in abolishing the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a miniscule amount of agreement with my hon Friends, but there is a much wider issue involved. If the Minister can say that, as he will devise sensitive procedures, no problem such as that at Jordanhill will recur, I should be happy. However, the clause contains no suggestion that sensitive procedures will be adopted. As the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnson) said, if the Government are serious about developing such procedures, they should make the voluntary code of practice mandatory. That is reasonable. It was introduced more than 14 years ago to give practical guidance to employers and employees on drawing up sensible disciplinary rules and procedures, and on how to develop those effectively. That voluntary code of practice requires employers to provide written information for their employees about aspects of disciplinary rules and procedures. That information must be available at the start and then elaborated on. I should like the Minister to say that he agrees with that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Mention has been made that an employer may be ordered to reinstate or re-engage an imployee if an industrial tribunal decides that, but I understand that it is hard to get to an industrial tribunal. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, it now costs £150.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no way in which I can see the correlation between what the hon. Member is saying and the amendment to the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I am saying that employees who are dismissed need the best representation and the best rules and procedures drawn up so that their cases can be dealt with adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment does not cover that. It refers to
	<br><q><p>"the right to be represented by a member of their professional association or trade union, a colleague or a friend at any hearing".</p></q>
The hon. Member must try to confine his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you again, Mr. Hogg. I shall not go back on what I said about your good self a few moments ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
I am worried about the lack of procedures referred to in the clause. We are trying to focus our attention on that so that the Government can take cognisance of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing not a clause but a schedule. I say that to bring home to the hon. Member that we have been discussing the schedule for some time. He must try to confine his remarks to the proposal. If he succeeded in doing that, I am sure that he would remain in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You remind me of my old headmaster, Mr. Hogg. Every time you stand up, I tremble and wonder what is coming next. I shall not risk getting the belt. I have tried to argue my point as well as I can and hope that the Minister will consider the matters that were raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has been sitting down for some time. Perhaps the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) was engaged in the acclamation following his hon. Friend's speech, but there was a long pause and the hon. Member knows that I do not like long silences. I assume that when that happens, the Committee is satisfied that the issues have been debated fully. However with the characteristic generosity for which I am becoming noted, I shall allow the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden to make his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I was waiting for the acclamation on the Conservative Benches to die down and thought that you were rising to bring them to order to listen to my speech on this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually, when I stand up, your face drops somewhat, Mr. Hogg. Perhaps that is because I do not have the lilting tone of voice of my hon. friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). It is a pleasure to hear him speak as his voice conjures up a picture of the Western Isles. We can almost see the rolling roads and the smoking peat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Rolling fog and roads to the isles are not mentioned in the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member will now refer to it. After all, he is speaking on behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that my hon. Friend is speaking on behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition, but it was clear from the way in which the Minister sat down when you, Mr. Hogg, spoke to us that those who speak on behalf of Her Majesty's Government have no intention of replying to the debate. That is an alarming development as many questions have been asked to which the Minister is duty bound to reply. Does my hon. Friend agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The only reason why I mentioned the rolling roads was that teachers must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
go down them and pass the peat fires to reach the schools in which they work. My comments were relevant to the amendment. We are worried about non-trade union members who are sacked from those schools down the rolling roads. I was simply trying to illustrate the background to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous discussions, our remarks have always been prefaced with references to Strathclyde, Our Lady and St. Francis, Notre Dame or Paisley grammar. Education in Scotland is about not just the political prejudices against Paisley grammar, but the sacking of teachers who do not have proper representation at hearings. Teachers might be sacked from Paisley grammer, so the amendment could be relevant to them. But there is more to education than that school. We are concerned about pupils, parents, teachers and others involved and employed in schools. The amendment refers to the rights of individual employees, which will not be protected properly by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister tried to wind up the debate and give us reassurances. He said that he hoped that he had been helpful. Occasionally, he has been most helpful, for example, when he unexpectedly accepted an amendment this morning. At first, he said that he might consider it but, for clearly tactical reasons, he was bulldozed by his Back Benchers into accepting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, the Minister tells us that he will be helpful, and that the provisions will be part of the great code of conduct in the Employment Protection Act 1975. We would usually accept some of his helpful suggestions and reassurances but, after this morning's experience, we must consider the matter in more detail. We thought that we had an understanding with the Minister in that he would introduce proposals for a democratically elected parental majority on boards of management. Perhaps he did not say that. We might be wrong to suggest that he reneged on such a commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. I gave a clear commitment to the Committee that it would be possible for the boards of management to have a parental majority. The Opposition were in difficulty, because they were tabling an amendment that contradicted what they proposed previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will not respond to the Minister's intervention. We are now raking over coals that died down hours ago. We are dealing with amendment No. 90.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. We are arguing, whether rightly or wrongly, that the Minister reneged. Perhaps we wrongly interpreted what he said. Because of this morning's experience, it is our job to probe him to find out what is happening. We are discussing the employment rights of individuals. The Minister said that the code of practice is good practice, and that we must trust the boards of management; they would go against that legislation at their peril. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>437</span>
said that he would instruct them on how they must act. The Minister says that he does not need to accept the amendment because he will give the boards of management instructions, but we need to know what those instructions will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the important issue of Jordanhill, which affects my constituency. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is always keen to talk about Our Lady and St. Francis, Notre Dame, or Paisley grammar, which are well outwith his constituency, on the basis that the children of some of his constituents may be pupils there. I do not wish to deal with individual cases, because they are not our concern, nor do I wish to question the good faith of those involved in boards of management, but we want to know whether what happened will be the norm in the future for boards of management. We have to agree that matters were handled badly, as a result of which the issue was dragged through the press. That would not have happened had matters been in the hands of the Strathclyde education authority. That body would have used the correct procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that throughout the dispute neither the hon. Member for Eastwood nor the Minister ever saw fit to mention the matter or to pass an opinion for or against what was happening. It is also surprising that they were never interviewed or that other procedures were not followed that usually create mischief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not want to castigate those who were involved—I am sure that they acted in good faith— I wonder which procedures were followed. Was the code of practice followed in detail or was it broken? Did someone always accompany the person at the hearing? I am surprised that the Minister fails to rise to reply to those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem that faced those people, who were no doubt well-intentioned and had good will, was a matter not only of the procedures to be followed but of good personnel practice? Only people with company experience in such matters could be expected to know about such practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not blame the individuals involved because they may not have been experienced in good personnel practice. That is why our amendment is necessary. But it is a question not only of good practice but of good behaviour. That is what was missing. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Employment Protection Act 1975 set up a code of practice, but that code does not mention standards or quality of behaviour. Sometimes it is necessary to write that in. Individuals do not go out of their way to be malicious, but such things happen in the course of normal behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had time to read the code of practice. What it says is interesting. Section 2 says:
	<br><q><p>"Disciplinary rules and procedures are necessary for promoting fairness and order in the treatment of individuals and in the conduct of industrial relations. They also assist an organisation to operate effectively."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
The amendment ensures that self-governing school boards operate effectively. We are considering relationships with staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Achieving high quality education involves many factors. Pupils, of course, are part of that, as are the parents. But for too long in our discussion of the Bill we have neglected teachers. They are an integral part. Without an input from teachers beyond the terms of reference of their contracts, education deteriorates. We have seen that since the industrial dispute generated by the hon. Member for Eastwood which resulted in him being sacked from his position— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the Minister wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the Minister will indicate if he wishes to intervene. The hon. Member should continue his speech. I am waiting to hear what he has to say next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that I cannot tell whether the Minister is speaking or grumbling. I thought that he wished to correct me about the result of the industrial dispute generated by the hon. Member for Eastwood, who is not here. I am sorry about that and I shall wait until he returns and perhaps discuss the matter further then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dispute, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) will recall, broke down the important part of the teachers' input into the school, the part beyond nine o'clock to four o'clock. My hon. Friend who is a teacher and is very knowledgeable about these matters knows that there is more to education than simply what goes in in the short space of the day. To ensure that that part is put in, it is essential that the teacher feels part of that school and that he is treated properly and fairly. If he steps out of line, the matter should be dealt with properly and efficiently. As long as teachers feel part of the body politic of that school their contribution will be greatly enhanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton knows, contributions come after school in sport and music for example. Many teachers take children on holidays. That broke down as a result of the efforts of the hon. Member for Eastwood, from which Scottish education is still trying to recover. We do not want that to be exacerbated further by boards of management who do not adhere to proper procedures in dealing with individuals. The example of Jordanhill school does not give us any grounds for comfort and makes us even more worried about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend would wish to know that this part of the schedule dealing with dismissal has been taken in its entirety from the Education Reform Act 1988. Does that have a bearing on the lack of response that we have had from the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it has a bearing perhaps I should sit down and let my hon. Friend describe it. Otherwise I shall return to the matter that I was pursuing. I do not want to belabour the point but the Bill, apart from being prefaced in Strathclyde, is all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
about parents, parents, parents. It never mentions the child. I made that point in the first debate on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can well recall the hon. Gentleman's speeches and I fear that I have heard that particular point from him on a number of occasions. I would hate to charge him with being repetitious. I am sure that he can stay with amendment No 90 to schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I do not wish to filibuster. Having studied some educational psychology and learning techniques I know that to get the message through, it is necessary to repeat it on a number of occasions, particularly when one is dealing with those who are not very receptive, such as Conservative Members. I am just using standard educational psychology techniques to try to get the message through. I am sorry that you, Mr. Hogg, pick it up very quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in the hon. Gentleman's educational psychology techniques, but I would be more impressed if he were enthusiastic in adhering to our Standing Orders and remaining in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always only too pleased to remain in order. You must agree, Mr. Hogg, that it is unusual for me to be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned repetition, which he has not yet elevated to an art form. He said that the Bill is about parents, parents, parents. The Bill concerns less than the 1 per cent. of the parents in a school who will be invested with executive powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member's intervention would have been more helpful if, instead of drawing attention to what is or is not in the Bill, he had referred to what is definitely in amendment No. 90.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, and I shall not respond. My hon. Friend said that the Bill is not about parents, but my point was that the Government maintain that it is about parents. The amendment is about the rights of individuals employed in schools. We must deal with the rights of teachers. I shall quote from the Bible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I take it that it appears in the code of practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is relevant. The Bible is an excellent code of practice. Conservative Members seem to read 	<i>Life and Work</i> at great length, so I shall read a verse from the Bible and I shall ask them to tell me where it comes from. It concerns the rights of teachers, which are referable to the amendment. The verse is:
	<br><q><p>"shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying, This is the way, walk ye in it".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
Can any Conservative Member tell me where that comes from, because they are all great exponents of the Church of Scotland and religion in school? I call their bluff. Can they even tell me whether it is from the Old or the New Testament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must not sit down. He can invite Conservative Members to respond, but he must continue his speech or I shall conclude that he has finished his remarks. However, I am fascinated to know where the quotation came from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning we were subjected to the use of religion as a political tool. I used this quotation from the Bible to justify the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member knows that I am always impressed with scriptural support for an argument but that is stretching the point a little far. After he has told us where the quotation comes from—I am sure that the 	<i>Hansard</i> writer needs to know—I hope that he will return to the amendment. It is amendment No. 90 in case he has forgotten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will refer to amendment No. 90. We should note that Conservative Members were even unable to say whether it is from the Old or the New Testament. It is from Isaiah chapter 30 verses 20 and 21. I shall not pursue it, but I warn Conservative Members that I shall use my knowledge of the scriptures to find out whether their knowledge is limited to a cutting from 	<i>Life and Work</i> or goes deeper than that. Their behaviour this morning was disgraceful. They used religion as a sectarian political tool rather than as a means of formulating a system of life, a code of conduct and a standard of morals in their relationship with one another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been more than tolerant with the hon. Member. He is clearly enjoying himself, but he must stay in order. I have now heard these arguments rehearsed at length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have not heard Isaiah chapter 30 verses 20 and 21 before, Mr. Hogg. However, I shall return to the amendment because it is about the rights of individuals and teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will realise that the Minister is resisting the amendment on the basis that there is a voluntary code of practice. The code allows an individual to be accompanied by a trade union representative or by a fellow employee of his choice. That is different from the amendment, which states that the individual is entitled to be accompanied by whoever he wishes. Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses might wish to be represented not by a trade unionist or a fellow employee, but by a member of their own faith. The voluntary code of practice would discriminate against such groups, but the amendment would help them. Does my hon. Friend not agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Western Isles pointed out that the Opposition are often accused of being interested only in trade unionists. However, we are also concerned about members of other organisations and for that reason, the amendment is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the code of conduct is applied, individuals will have redress to courts or, should they feel it to be necessary, to an industrial tribunal. That is a difficult approach for an individual to adopt. We should try to prevent that happening because it leads to dissent and unhappiness within the school and to a deterioration in the quality of education. The amendment, in trying to protect the rights of individuals, will ensure that everyone feels part of the school, and is committed, and makes a contribution, to it. It is unacceptable if the only option that people have is to go to an industrial tribunal. That might take some time, and even if it finds in an individual's favour, it only provides compensation and does not give him back the position that he had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we support the amendment. Earlier, if the Minister had given us assurances, we might have considered other courses of action. However, after our previous experience, we realise that we need to explore the issues properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important amendment about the rights of individuals working within schools. The Government do not believe in rights, but use the word as a political tool. The Minister has suggested that the amendment is unnecessary because there is a code of practice and that we should trust boards of management because they would renege on it at their peril. Our experience of the one school that might be relevant gives us no confidence that we should leave the Bill as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Despite the length of the debate, no new points have been put forward with which I did not deal in my introductory remarks. The amendment is unnecessary and the issue straightforward, as the Opposition believed this morning. All the points relate to general employment law. The board of a self-governing school should not be treated differently from other employers, including local authorities, in relation to its staff. On that basis, I should have thought that Opposition Members could have answered some of the specific questions themselves, but I shall try to cover all the matters of substance that were raised.

might be wrong. Inaccuracies creep into speeches, but it is not a point of order to say that a statement is wrong. A point of order relates to the provisions for order as laid down in the Standing Orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in order for the Minister to give information, even if it is inaccurate. The Chair can do nothing about that. Presumably the Minister makes statements in good faith. If hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It always pays to listen to the end of a sentence before pronouncing, but if hon.

The board is in exactly the same position as any other employer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the qualification was added later, but it is important too for the Minister to acknowledge that in most cases where an industrial tribunal makes a judgment on a dismissal, compensation is paid in lieu of a person being taken back. Industrial tribunals may make a ruling, but it is not up to any organisation to accept or adopt what they recommend. It is important to put that on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the advantages of being a Minister is that one has access to a great body of advice, particularly legal advice. I shall repeat what I said for the hon. Gentleman's benefit; he will find that it encompasses his point. I said that if the tribunal orders reinstatement or compensation, the board must comply on pain of enforcement in the courts. The hon. Gentleman is making a point about compensation. What happens if an industrial tribunal so orders and reinstatement is not carried out is that compensation is awarded. Therefore, the position is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
clear for all employers and I hope that that clarifies it to the satisfaction of Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made it clear that if a decision is ignored, it can be enforced through the courts.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now asking me to go deep into employment law, which is not what we are discussing under the amendment. I was answering the point about the position of the employee. The employee's position will be exactly the same in a self-governing school as it would be under any other employer. The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that the amendment to the schedule is about whether it would be possible for someone to be accompanied by a friend or representative which, as I have said, is covered in the code.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister understand the point of the amendment? The constant reference to an industrial tribunal is one step removed from it. Having a professional association, trade union or friend involved may facilitate a solution or better representation, which would avoid recourse to an industrial tribunal. Why does not the Minister apply himself to the simple, reasonable and fair-minded point made by amendment No. 90?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I made when we began the discussion—it seems like several hours ago; I do not know how long ago it was—was that the code of practice would apply and that it was a code of good practice which any employer should follow. If an employer disregarded it, there would be certain consequences—in particular, if an employee was dismissed and the tribunal to which he appealed found that some aspect of the code of practice had not been followed, that would be a reason for treating the case as an unfair dismissal. As the code specifically provides for the individual to be accompanied by a union representative or a fellow employee of his choice, which is the gist of the amendment, the question put by the hon. Member for Fife, Central is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon.

The Employment Protection Act provides for rights of redress if the individual feels that the matter has not been properly handled, and that is how the disciplinary procedure should be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said that education authorities have agreed disciplinary procedures with their unions and that the code of practice was not enough. The code itself recommends that employers have such written agreements. He asked why we should include a provision in the Bill in that case. We have done so to ensure that the agreed arrangements are incorporated in the scheme of government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that employment law is not the Minister's area of responsibility, but I thought that it was common knowledge that, even if someone is awarded reinstatement in his job by a tribunal, the law does not enforce it. Because of the unpleasantness surrounding the events, that person may not want to return to his old job, but totally inadequate compensation is awarded. The Minister has shown no sign of taking those points on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how the hon. Lady can say that, because I have already dealt with that point. If an order is made to reinstate but the employers do not do so, compensation can be awarded. The hon. Lady is right to say that it is common knowledge that employers cannot be compelled to reinstate. That is why I was astonished when Labour Front-Bench spokesmen jumped up as if they had discovered a loophole in my remarks.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier the Minister expressed the belief—he has just reaffirmed it—that there was no need to accept the amendment on the ground that a body of parents was to be treated the same as any other employer. Surely there is a crucial difference between parents coming together in their spare time to form a body to run a school and employers who, in the normal course of events, practise their jobs and conduct personnel affairs daily. If the Minister asked parents about the amendment, he would see that they would welcome it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Therefore, I expect that the hon. Lady will join the Government in arguing for the abolition of the section 88 provisions, which are exactly the type of provisions that she argues are inappropriate. It is not inappropriate that the board of management
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
should be bound by employment law, or that the rights or freedoms given to employees of the board of managements as for those of any other employer. If, in carrying out their duties, the boards of management behave unfairly, there will be a right of redress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister met my points fully when he said that a teacher in a self-governing school would have the same protection as a teacher in a school run by a local education authority. In the latter case, the teacher would have the protection of written agreement, which would give him the right to have a chosen representative at a disciplinary procedure. Presumably, if the local education authority broke that written agreement and dismissal resulted, that would be sufficient ground for a case of unfair dismissal to be brought. Presumably that would not be the case where a self-governing school had no such written agreement. Will the Minister confirm that a teacher dismissed by a self-governing school without a written agreement would not have sufficient justification to bring a case of unfair dismissal to an industrial tribunal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) complained, I arranged for the code of practice to be available in the Committee Room, although you said that there was no obligation for me to do so, Mr. Hogg. If the hon. Gentleman had studied it, he would have found that the point about which he was concerned was there. It is a matter of good practice. I have already dealt with a case in which an employee had been dismissed and gone to a tribunal. If the code of practice had not been followed, the tribunal would be able to take a view on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's point is covered. If he is concerned about the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, this is not the appropriate Bill in which to amend it. The amendment is not concerned with that. The hon. Gentleman's legitimate concern should be whether teachers employed by the board of management of self-governing schools should be treated differently from those employed by the local authority. I have already given assurances on that which I hoped would result in us being able to proceed, and the amendment being withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[Mr. Allan Stewart 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stewart. I am sure that we shall benefit from your wit and wisdom when you intervene to bring me back to order as I argue against the schedule being part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles of constitution seem to apply only to Catholic schools in Scotland, and so discriminate against other denominational groups in Scotland. Catholics would have an unfair advantage by having the right to appoint someone from the Catholic Church to those schools described as being Catholic. In a school with a roll of between one and 500, only three co-opted members will be entitled to be on the board of management. The Catholic Church will have the right to nominate up to one third of the co-opted members. The Church of Scotland does not have the right to nominate co-opted members to the board of management of any school. I am the first to admit that I have an Irish Catholic background. Three members have admitted to being Scottish Presbyterians, but I am an Irish Catholic, which is an important strand in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making an important point. The Church of Scotland, Islamic and other denominational groups in Scotland should not be discriminated against in that way. One of the aims of the Bill is the emergence of denominational schools that represent other faiths in Scotland. Many Conservative Members argued that they wanted Presbyterian, Moslem and Hindu schools in Scotland. They said that they wanted schools that were based on the idea of religious separation and that from the age of five children should be sent to a denominational school, whether those schools were Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopalian or whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman see the reported speech and television appearance of the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparbrook (Mr. Hattersley), in which he said that the Labour Party's policy was to establish denominational schools for Moslems? Does the hon. Gentleman disagree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will listen to my argument, I shall explain my point of view. I had to be reminded who my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) is, and of course he is the deputy leader of the Labour party. A continual thread in our debates is the Minister's habit of citing examples of what is happening in England as if they applied to Scotland too. That is what we mean by the anglicisation of Scottish education. The Minister keeps trying to apply the English experience to Scottish education. That does not work. No Opposition Member would argue that the practice in England should necessarily be replicated in Scotland, as we have a distinctive educational system. We treat it differently, and it is dealt with as such by the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first paragraph of the schedule can be applied fairly only if it covers—all types—not just Roman Catholic—of denominational groups. They should all have the same rights. In the main, the denominational schools in Scotland are Roman Catholic and have been since 1918. People do not consider that there is anything wrong with that, but I doubt whether anyone would welcome the introduction of the concept that, at the age of five, children should be divided and put into separate schools because they happen to belong to different religious faiths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what would happen in those circumstances to the parents' charter which is much beloved of the Minister. He argues that every child must have the right to be accepted into any school. Earlier, he referred to schools having a distinctly Christian ethos when he spoke about Catholic schools, but that description cuts across a range of groups, such as Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopalians and wee frees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents want their children brought up as Catholics, they would not be likely to send them to a school with a distinctly Presbyterian ethos. Equally, if Presbyterian parents wish their children to be brought up as Presbyterians, they are unlikely to wish to send them to a school that has a distinctly Catholic or Moslem ethos. The Bill will result in developments that are unwanted by everyone in Scotland. It will award rights to people on the basis of the religious denominational group to which they belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 states:
	<br><q><p>"The articles of constitution for a school shall provide that—
	<br><q><p>(a) a person who is eligible for election to a board of management as a staff member shall not be eligible for election as a parent member, or to be an appointed member, of that board."</p></q></p></q>
The provision will discriminate against parents who are also teachers at the school. Other parents will have the right either to be co-opted members or to be elected on a different basis to the board of management, but a parent who also happens to be a teacher will be prohibited from being appointed to the board or elected as a parent member. That is unfair. Surely it is up to the electorate to decide whom they wish to represent it on the board of a self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people wish to be represented through a parent member by someone who is a teacher at the school too, it is up to them. It is not for the Minister to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>449</span>
dictate to them. We are always hearing that he wishes to increase people's choice, yet he is narrowing down that choice by telling parents who they can, or cannot, vote for. If I were a parent and a teacher in those circumstances, I would have a good case to take before the European Court of Human Rights as the Bill would unfairly discriminate against me. The Minister would find it difficult to justify such discrimination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know why teachers who are also parents of children at the school should be so excluded? What is the Government's reason for excluding people who know about teaching?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Government's objection to such a proposal is because such people know about teaching and might be sympathetic to teachers. Throughout our debates, we have realised that the Government have a deep distrust and dislike of teachers or teacher representative organisations, such as the Educational Institute of Scotland. They continually attack teachers and their organisations. This is blatant discrimination against teachers in Scotland. It serves no other purpose than satisfying the Minister's baser instincts in getting at teachers whenever he can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's slick PR phrase in the Committee has been, "Trust the parents". Do we take it that we trust the parents so long as they are not teachers, but if they are teachers, we should forget about them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the case. The Minister has so far shown himself to be very unfair in his treatment of teachers in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3(a) is unfair and discriminatory. In itself it is sufficient justification for hon. Members to decide not to agree to the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3(c) states:
	<br><q><p>"a retiring member of a board of management shall not be disqualified, by reason only of such retirement, from further election, or appointment, to the board."</p></q>
[Mr. Norman Hogg 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision, on its own, suggests that there is no limit to the time that a person can serve as a member of a board, whether as a parent or as a staff member. That is unhealthy. We do not want the same small group of parents being in office continously and running the school's affairs through the board of management. Paragraph 5(b)(iii) states that membership of a board shall be terminated if the member
	<br><q><p>"is either a parent member who has ceased to have a child in attendance at the school or a staff member who has ceased to be a member of staff of the school."</p></q>
That seems fair, but paragraph 6 states:
	<br><q><p>"No provision shall be made under paragraph 5(b)(iii) above in relation to any person the unexpired period of whose term of office is less than two years."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
That suggests that a parent could transfer his child from one school to another because he had fallen out with the board of management but that he would still be entitled to serve his remaining period of office, which could be one year, 11 months and 30 days. That parent could still exercise a significant influence on the school's affairs although his child was no longer a pupil there, and he had no direct interest in the school. It may be possible under the schedule for a person to be elected to one board of management in one self-governing school and to move his child to another school while simultaneously being elected to the board of the second school. So a parent could serve on the boards of management of two self-governing schools at the same time. Those schools might be in competition with each other in trying to attract pupils. That would be an unhealthy development and the Minister should look closely at that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One good thing has come out of paragraph 4, which states:
	<br><q><p>"The articles of constitution for a school shall, without prejudice to paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 to this Act, provide that the term of office of appointed members shall be such period of between five and seven years as may be specified in the articles".</p></q>
But the Committee has already accepted an amendment that will change the five and seven years to two to four years. That is one of the few signs that the schedule is worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more serious complaints have been made about the schedule. I am worried about the management structure that it allows a board of management to impose on a self-governing school. For example, the board has the right not only to set up sub-committees but to delegate to them full powers to take important decisions. In itself, that is serious enough, but it becomes even more serious when we consider the people who can serve on those subcommittees. They need not be elected members of the board of management; no parent member, no staff member, no head teacher need be on a subcommittee. It would be open to the board of management to compose the membership of subcommittees so that they consisted entirely of co-opted members. Furthermore, it could ensure that members of sub-committees were not even members of the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8 states that
	<br><q><p>"the provision mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) above may provide for a committee to include persons who are not members of the board of management."</p></q>
The vital word is "include" but there is nothing to say that it cannot comprise entirely persons who are not members of the board of management. It would be open for a small group of parents, elected on a very small turnout, to form sub-committees with delegated powers, which would take important decisions affecting all the children in those schools, and for those committees to consist of people with no relationship to the electorate. I simply cannot understand how that is putting power back into the hands of parents and making boards of management accountable to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 is even more alarming. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The board of management of a school may be empowered by the articles of constitution to pay to their members and to such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>451</span>
other persons as are, by virtue of paragraph 8 above, members of a committee established by virtue of sub-paragraph (b) of that paragraph, such travelling, subsistence or other allowances as may be determined in accordance with a scheme made by the board and approved by the Secretary of State."</p></q>
We know that that means that the Secretary of State must approve whatever payments those people agree to make to each other. Surely it is a very unhealthy development that a small elite group of people can be elected to a board of management and can then decide to allocate to themselves such allowances as they deem fit. Moreover, they can appoint their friends to the sub-committees and make allowances for them. I assume that "allowances" means payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the few arguments that is advanced in support of the privatisation of bus companies is that the people who serve as directors of those companies can then receive payments. As long as they were under local authority control, they could not receive payments. Here the Government are encouraging people to set up boards of management and to pay each other what could be fat allowances. It would be difficult for parents to find out what was happening. When we debate later parts of the Bill, we shall see just how much information will be made available to parents about what happens inside the board of management and its committee structures and what chance they will have to make the board of management accountable for its actions. This is a serious matter and I would vote against the whole idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate we discussed how people had the right to be represented at any disciplinary hearings called by the board of management. The Minister made it clear when he wound up that debate that the right of any staff member employed in a self-governing school to be accompanied by whomever he wished at a disciplinary hearing could not be guaranteed under the employment legislation and industrial tribunals. Ultimately he conceded that if a self-governing school's board of management resisted the decision of an industrial tribunal, it would be left to the employee to try to enforce that decision through the courts. Any individual who does not have much time or money and tries to take his employer to court runs the risk of losing his case and having the costs awarded against him. That is a sufficient disincentive, to ensure that no employee whose board of management resisted an industrial tribunal decision would risk taking the board to the courts to impose that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which the staff member could have been guaranteed the right to be accompanied by whomever he wished at a disciplinary hearing would have been to accept amendment No. 90. The Minister and his hon. Friends voted to ensure that that right would not be extended to staff members who were in dispute with their board of management. That does not surprise me. Only a matter of hours ago on the Floor of the House the same Conservative Members were cheering loudly at the prospect of the reimposition of the human auctions that used to take place at the docks, when people were hired and fired on a daily basis. It does not surprise me that they are also trying to diminish and to keep to the minimum the rights of employees under the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
Paragraph 2(a) of part II of the schedule states:
	<br><q><p>"that the board of management shall so exercise their functions as to ensure that the school continues to conform to the description for the time being so contained".</p></q>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "for the time being" is another reason for not supporting the schedule. Clause 16(4) requires a description of the school: whether it is a single-sex school, a school open to boys and girls, a denominational school, or a school with an admissions policy based on academic criteria. The schedule requires the board of management to write down the description of the school as at the time of transfer to opted-out status. The words "for the time being" enable the board of management to change the characteristics of the school. It could change it to a school based on academic selection or religious denomination or to a school that precludes the provision of special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2(b) of part II deals with the appeal committee structure that the articles of management lay down in the event of
	<br><q><p>"the admission of pupils to the school; or … the exclusion of any pupil from the school."</p></q>
I am in favour of an appeals procedure that allows people to appeal against decisions of boards of management that are elected by such a small electorate. But I am worried that boards of management will be able to refuse pupils admission to their school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister refers to the control of admission by boards of management, the only example that he cites is that when the school is full up, the board will have to refuse pupils even if they live in the same street as the school. But that is not the only case of refusal of admission. The school may be charged from a secondary school to a mixture of a secondary school and a further education college that may include adults. The Government insisted on the right of the board of management to have further education classes in the school. It may want a significant portion of the school to be dedicated to further education and on that basis deny access to pupils who live locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to academic criteria. A school will be able to establish admission procedures so that only pupils who pass examinations set by the school will be allowed admission. If it has that power, it is no good setting up an appeals procedure because it would only confirm the right of the school to refuse admission to any pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that self-governing schools will not be able to walk away from the problem of indiscipline. But under the Bill such schools will be able to do so because they will be able to exclude certain pupils. Once a pupil has been excluded, the school no longer needs to concern itself with the education of that child. But the education authority cannot walk away from that responsibility. It must deal with that pupil. The self-governing school could expel pupils who are causing problems and dump them on the education authority, which would have to deal with those recalcitrant pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, a self-governing school could not only dump its discipline problems on the education authority, but could throw out any special unit set up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>453</span>
by the education authority to deal with indisciplined pupils. It could tell the authority to find another way of dealing with those pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the height of hypocrisy for the Government to try to pass this schedule, which will damage the education infrastructure in Scotland, and, at the same time, claim that their aim is to give parents more choice and freedom. That is why I am bitterly opposed to the schedule. I have yet to hear an argument from Conservative Members to convince me that working-class people's opportunities for education will be enhanced by the Bill. In reality, opportunities for working-class kids will be diminished. The Bill will strengthen the position of the privileged, and the underpriviledged will suffer even more than they do now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully concur with the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), especially when he said that the Bill would not provide more openness, access or choice. It is about exclusion and selection. That is clear from the reluctance of the Government to accept the Opposition's amendments that would make the Bill more acceptable to the main body of the Scottish people. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, in opposing schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some questions about the schedule; my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East referred to one of them in passing during his speech. Paragraph 9 refers to allowances to members. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The board of management of a school may be empowered by the articles of constitution to pay to their members"</p></q>
various sums, including travelling, subsistence and a broad category of other allowances. The Minister should explain what the broad category contains. Does it include a wage or salary to be paid to members of the board of management?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is my own fault that I do not know this, but I am not clear whether parents taking leave from their workplace to serve on the boards would have the same right to be paid off as councillors and those serving on juries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point, but I do no know whether the answer is contained in the Bill. We must await the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled about another item. Paragraph 9 refers in broad and generous terms to sums of money being available to the board of management for travelling, subsistence and, possibly, salaries, fees and so on. In the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill, the paragraphs on the "Financial Effects of the Bill' make no mention of the financial implications of schedule 1. That is puzzling. The opening sentence of the first paragraph states:
	<br><q><p>"the financial effect of allowing schools to become self-governing (clauses 1–47) should be generally neutral."</p></q>
It continues:
	<br><q><p>"Schools will also qualify for capital grant and limited other expenditure (Clauses 25–27)."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>454</span>
It also states:
	<br><q><p>"Small additional costs to the Secretary of State will be the funding of parents' ballots (clause 14) and the remuneration and expenses of commissioners for school assets (Schedule 9)."</p></q>
However, there is no mention of schedule 1. Is it in order for the opening part of the Bill, which describes its financial effects, to exclude or forget to mention the crucial schedule 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for me. My responsibility is to ensure that the debate is conducted according to the Standing Orders laid down for Standing Committees. It is for the Minister to account for what is in the Bill. I am sure that he will have noted the hon. Gentleman's point and will respond to it at a suitable moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I am willing to give way to the Minister at any time if he wishes to explain why the financial effects of the Bill do not cover that crucial schedule and the possibly open-ended sums in respect of
	<br><q><p>"travelling, subsistence or other allowances".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I should prefer to wait until the end of his speech before answering his various points, assuming that we remember what they were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that I shall not have to remind the Minister of the points that I shall make as that might try the patience of those hon. Members whose memory is better than his. It is odd that this clause and schedule are excluded from the financial effects in the Bill. Schedule 1(9) may belie the claim that the financial implications of the Bill will be generally neutral. If travelling expenses, subsistence payments, salaries and fees are to be paid to members of a board of management, the mind literally boggles as to what they could include. Part III of the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill states that clauses 25 to 27 offer further information. I read those looking for a clue about the financial effects of clause 9, but clause 25 refers to clause 7(1). The two clauses combined appear to give the Secretary of State responsibility to subsidise a board of management in any actions that
	<br><q><p>"provide suitable and efficient school education".</p></q>
If that includes requiring him to subsidise travelling and subsistence payments, where will the line be drawn? If members of the board of management found it necessary in pursuing a superior form of school education to investigate education elsewhere in this country or in Europe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>455</span>
hon. Friend has made a crucial point. The schedule refers to "other allowances". I cannot believe that members of the board of management would go to places such as Hong Kong to examine the education system there—although they might, because Conservative Members have been talking about the benefits of education in France and in various other areas. But we must explore what "other allowances" might entail so that I may consider the matter and perhaps return to it when I speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to dwell too long on that because I have other points to make. I shall leave it to my hon. Friend to pursue that line, although the "other allowances" to which he referred do not appear to be relevant to trips to Hong Kong or elsewhere because there is a specific mention of payments for travelling and subsistence. Presumably that means board members being put up in hotels when they go to Hong Kong, America or Sweden to examine the various forms of education being pursued in those countries. The heading "other allowances" may be a category distinct from that of travelling and subsistence. Does it refer to the possibility of some sort of fee, wage or salary being paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There could be car allowances. We await the Minister's remarks on what the allowances are and what are their financial effects. Will he give estimates of the allowances that the Secretary of State would consider it reasonable for a board of management to incur for travel and subsistence in pursuit of its own education about the education systems of other countries? What ceiling will the Secretary of State put on such allowances? Will the Minister also explain the more technical matter of why that was not mentioned under the heading of "Financial Effects of the Bill"? Could it be that he was trying to slip it through under our noses? If so, we should be grateful that we are taking time to consider this important schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of travel expenses and allowances, my hon. Friend will know that in Scotland there are committees and quangos of all kinds which have at least some Government involvement and for which there are varying levels of travel allowance and subsistence. The Minister has failed to tell us what level he has in mind. It will be interesting when he tells us because it will reflect how much importance he assigns to the parents who will receive those allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Given that the Minister is apparently applying a general rule of making financial awards to self-governing schools roughly equivalent to the financial allocations to education authorities, the education authorities will listen with interest to the Minister's reply in the hope that if extra sums are to be disbursed for such activities, they will be able to enjoy some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the finance that is available to self-governing schools is roughly in line
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
with what they would expect from the education authority, as the Minister stated, does my hon. Friend find it surprising that allowances are not consistent with allowances for local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. We await the Minister's response to all those questions. But I wish to move on to other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred to what he apparently sees as the great need for more denominational schools in Scotland. In a remark relevant to paragraph 1 of the schedule, he said that only denominational schools were characterised by a religious ethos. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) thought that he said "Christian ethos". He did not; he said that only denominational schools are characterised by a religious ethos. Opposition Members were completely taken aback by that, and I shall carry that statement back with me to my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dinner, we were discussing some of the financial implications of the schedule. I particularly wished to pick up the Minister's reference to the fact that, as he saw it, no schools in Scotland had a distinct religious ethos other than denominational schools. It will occasion some surprise when I convey that message back to my constituents. I wonder whether the Minister meant what he was saying. It must be clear to him that schools in my constituency such as the Nicolson Institute and Liniclate have a distinct religious ethos without being denominational schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman takes a close interest in the Nicolson Institute. He will know that it was inspected last year and that its provision of religious education was among a number of subjects noted by the inspectorate as needing further development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the Minister did not wish to narrow the notion of having a distinct religious ethos to a specific part of the curriculum. I sought to point out that the Christian ethose and values which are strongly held in my constituency imbue the Nicolson Institute in all its actions and aspects, not simply as a part of the curriculum. The whole ethos of the school is dominated by a reference to and an acknowledgement of the Christian values of the community. It would not be the Nicolson Institute without that distinctive Christian background from the community which pervades the school. The same is true of Liniclate, which has managed to achieve the same sense of all its activities and the behaviour of staff and pupils alike being imbued with the values of the Christian beliefs predominant in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents will take great offence at the Minister's slight upon them, and the inference that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
they can capture that distinct religious ethos only by, for example, Liniclate school becoming a specifically Catholic school, and the Nicolson Institute becoming a specifically Presbyterian school. That would be contrary to the wishes of the community, which is for an integration of the different faiths—a correspondence between the schools' ethos and the Christian ethos of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) emphasised religious education in respect of the schedule. Perhaps I should say a little more about ethos. This morning I said that the only schools with a religious ethos were the denominational schools. At present, those are the only schools that guarantee that the whole school will be organised on Christian values. A self-governing school could have it written into its scheme of government that it would be so organised, and the school could have a formal link with a church, which would make it a denominational school. That is a separate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The author of the 	<i>Life and Work</i> article that we discussed earlier said that a self-governing school, whether denominational or not, could proclaim itself a Christian school. That is a wider issue than the standard of provision of religious education in the curriculum and I make no judgment on it. All schools must make provision for that subject and, as is to be expected, the quality varies across the country. In some schools the provision is of a high standard, and I do not underestimate the contribution of individual teachers and head teachers. Nor would I deny the contribution that a Christian union might make to extra-curricular activities in, say, the Nicolson Institute. However, the school as an institution remains subject to the policies of its local authority, which must limit the extent to which the school can stress the religious ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in the less fevered atmosphere of a Committee without representatives of the fourth estate, the position will now be clear to Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the previous HMI report—I think that it was in 1986—said that the majority of non-denominational primary schools had no religious education policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I do not wish to detain the Committee by going into that in detail, but there was an inspectors' report entitled "Learning and Teaching—Religious Education" in 1986. It said:
	<br><q><p>"Nearly all schools inspected since 1983 claimed to provide religious education as part of the curriculum. However, provision varied from regular and frequent lessons in all classes in denominational and some non-denominational schools, to spasmodic and occasional teaching in others. In addition, most schools had some form of religious assembly on a weekly, fortnightly, monthly or termly basis, and a majority of non-denominational schools had no planned policy for religious education and followed no guidelines from regional or national sources. In many cases it was left to individual teachers whether to teach the subject and, if so, what to teach."</p></q>
My hon. Friend is right to point to that, just as earlier in the day several of my hon. Friends placed great
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>458</span>
emphasis on it in line with points that have bee made by parents—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that this does not interest Opposition Members, but it is c considerable interest to parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituents will be very interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that Lenzie academy has two full-time qualified religion education teachers, one of whom is a principal teacher, and that the school provides one hour a wee of religious education for all pupils and enters some candidates for O-grade in religious studies. I am sure that the teachers do an excellent job, but whether that shows a particular religious ethos, or whether the hon. Gentleman would describe that one hour a week as spent on witchcraft, is a matter that he can resolve with his constituents. They will undoubtedly find his remarks in the Committee of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The glory of schedule 1—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The emphasis on religion brings out those words. There is a glory in the schedule. Even the hon. Member for Western Isles did not hit on the glory of part II, which is that the provisions are not exhaustive and are not meant to be so. They are open-ended, allowing a scheme of government to include matters that the school considers significant. In short, they allow a school to define its district ethos and to entrench that in its constitution. That is why I commend the schedule to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about travelling expenses and related issues. The board of management will need to determine those and will take account of the position in the local authority sector. Indeed, contrary to everything that the Opposition have sai about the Bill, the schedule leaves decisions to be determined locally, and that is how it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

welcome my comments and, as he is known to be a bit of an iconoclast, he may become positively ecstatic. Who knows? Even the other Minister, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), might raise a drowsy head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is an awe-inspiring, horrible example of legal gobbledegook. It oozes mature pomposity. No self-respecting practitioner of the English language would use such arcane, clumsy, inelegant, incomprehensible phraseology. I read it three times, and that old, familiar feeling began to suffuse me— that deep feeling of puzzlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It occurred to me that such documents provide a way out—after all, there is an explanatory memorandum. I turned to it hastily, and it said:
	<br><q><p>	<i>"Clauses 7, 8 and 9 (and Part II of Schedule 1)</i> set out the powers and duties of the board of management and lay down what should be included in the articles of management."</p></q>
To say that what should be included is laid down is not exactly an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the clause together in a relaxed and informal way under the benign but gimlet eyes of our chummy Chairman, if I may so describe you, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(1) states:
	<br><q><p>"A document is validly executed"—</p></q>
I always thought that "executed" meant topped, but in this case it means bottomed—
	<br><q><p>"by a board of management if it is subscribed on their behalf by one of their members or by any other person duly authorised to do so."</p></q>
Neither "executed" nor "subscribed" means what it normally means, and why we have to be "duly" authorised instead of just authorised, I have never understood. The Minister will be aware of the existence of a grammatical form known as "tautology". Indeed, if he spends any time in the Committee, he will be sharply aware of it. "Duly authorised" is very tautological.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><q><p>"A document is to be presumed … to have been so executed if it bears to be so subscribed and to have been sealed with the board's common seal (whether attested by witnesses or not) unless the contrary is shown."</p></q>
I have changed the order a little. What the heck does "unless the contrary is shown" mean? If the contrary is shown, how is it shown; and if it can be shown, why is the statement made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to recognise, as do Opposition Members, that the Minister often speaks with a pleasing simplicity. That is a comment on the form rather than the content of his contributions. However, he would do a great service to the Committee, to the people who have to understand the Bill—both now and when it is enacted—to the English language, and thus to posterity, if he visited the peole who wrote this high-falutin', obscurantist, ritualistic, legal litany and told them that this is simply not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a simple, layman's suggestion to the Minister. In English, so far as I can make it out, clause 8(1) means that a document written by a board of management will be in order if it is signed with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
the board's agreement. I understand that to be the meaning, though it is not easy to know when one is dealing with executions, subscriptions and duly authorised matters. The second part seems to be wholly vitiated by the fact that if the contrary is shown, the whole thing goes down the Swannee river. Presumably only other lawyers can prove that the contrary can be shown. It should be written in English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been talking about religion all day, but none of the religious chaps are nearly as good as lawyers in dreaming up difficult language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(2) means that a document stamped with the board's official seal would be accepted as representing the board's opinion. That may be wrong. May we have the meaning in clear, straightforward English? It is about time that a clean wind blew away the dust of legal jargon in which this and much other legislation is shrouded. The Minister should fill his lungs and blow—I am sure that the Lord Chancellor would approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The truth is that I took this wording from the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) presented to the House. I think that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) was on the Committee that considered that legislation. That was cited as a precedent, so my hon. Friend is the real author of this wording. With his legal training he was able to assess the need for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to tell me that he was dissatisfied with the wording of the clause, so I reconsidered it and asked for advice. I have sympathy with his view. On the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 and on this Bill we tried to keep the language as simple as possible. We have been less successful on this Bill than on the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can help with the terminology, which I am advised is understood by lawyers. That may explain their existence. They no doubt earn a living by using these code words, which are a mystery to all of us. "Subscribed" is the term usually used for a document that is executed—signed at the end. It is common in conveyancing law. In contrast, the monarch superscribes documents; she signs at the top whereas commoners sign at the bottom. "Presumed" is used as part of the provision which creates a legal presumption that if a legal document has been executed in a particular way—signed by an authorised person and sealed with the board of management's common seal—it will be taken to have been validly executed. It will be for any challenger of the document to prove the contrary. If it were not for such a legal presumption, it would be for the board of management to establish the authenticity of the document in any legal proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining the basis for the legal presumption. If it were not for that legal presumption it would be for the board of management to establish the authenticity of the document in any legal proceedings. The term
	<br><q><p>"If it bears to be so subscribed"</p></q>
means that the document is taken to require no proof of its authenticity if, on the face of it, it appears that the requirements of clause 8 have been satisfied, that is, bears to have been signed by an authorised person and has been sealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber has the unanimous support of the Committee for his case. However, I have been advised that the terms are enshrined in legal case law and to depart from them could place the matter in doubt. I understand that the Scottish Law Commission has published a report, "Requirements of writing," which proposes reforms and simplifications of the law on the signing of documents and the legal formalities required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to keep the language and provisions of clause 8 as simple as possible, but in view of the opinions expressed by the Committee, I undertake to re-examine the commission's report to ensure that the terminology used is in line with that recommended by the commission after substantial public consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's remarks. The last words of clause 8(2) are
	<br><q><p>"(whether attested by witnesses or not)."</p></q>
First, why are those in brackets? Surely they should have had a modest comma in front of them. Secondly, if it makes no difference whether it is attested by witnesses or not, why have it at all? If, for all the theological, legal reasons about which the Minister was being frantically briefed a minute ago, it has to be there, could we not simply say "whether witnessed or not"? To heck with all this attestation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer and the hon. Gentleman has chosen the one part of the Bill on which my knowledge is weakest. The reason why the phrase
	<br><q><p>"(whether attested by witnesses or not)"</p></q>
appears in parentheses is by way of explanation. I would imagine that the term "attested" has a particular meaning of the kind which I have suggested. I have just been passed a note which says that the phrase is for the avoidance of doubt, which seems to be the same as by way of explanation. The other point that I would make to the hon. Gentleman, because I am unable to read the writing on this note,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
is that it seems that 8(2) makes it clear beyond doubt that whether or not the document has been attested by witnesses, it is to be presumed valid unless the contrary is shown. The presence or not of witnesses' signatures will not alter the validity of the document. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. I hope that on the basis of what I have said he will feel able to agree to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hope again that this is not a crucial amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are helpful probing amendments.

The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->

I hope that the Minister does not want to return to Victorian times, of when there were high walls around schools and signs saying "Boys" and "Girls" and that the rector would be available to see interested parents between 2pm and 3pm except on Fridays when he was at the Rotary club lunch. To prevent a return to those times, reporting back must be elaborate. That is particularly important for the parents who are not represented on the board, which accounts for the parents of 99 per cent. of the children. The Scottish Consumer Council has also asked for the reports to be published. From what the Minister has said, are we to infer that he agrees that the information should be made public annually? The public must be satisfied that the money made available to self-governing schools will be put to the best use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some places in a school where signs saying "Boys" and "Girls" can be useful and where they are as appropriate for the 20th century as they were for the 19th century. I was aware that the amendment had been tabled by the Opposition but proposed by the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. The Scottish Consumer Council also proposed a similar amendment. There is no difference of opinion between us. When we debate clause 25, I shall again give an undertaking in respect of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a mistake to include the requirement to provide information in primary legislation because it would be so difficult to change it. The glory of regulations—sorry, I used that word again. I meant the advantage of regulations is that they allow changes to be made in the light of experience. Some Opposition Members shared the delightful experience of serving on the Committee that considered the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, in which everyone was content that the issue should be covered by regulations. Although the Scottish Consumer Council and the SPTC seek a commitment that information should be provided, they would not wish it to be enshrined rigidly in legislation, so that it could not be altered until another education Bill was introduced. There have been two Bills dealing with education in Scotland in successive years, but that precedent will not continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The point of the amendment is evident. We had a long debate on clause 2; we shall return to the matter under amendments to clause 16(4) and clause 28. The Opposition are concerned about the debate surrounding ability and aptitude, and we link that to selection based on academic criteria. It is not appropriate to debate the matter further under this schedule; I imagine that we would go over many points that we have previously covered. I merely serve notice that it remains one of the more odious parts of the legislation and we intend to have a significant debate under later clauses in order to pinpoint the distinctions between ability, aptitude, giftedness and academic criteria as the basis of admission. We would welcome the Minister's comments, but we are aware of what they might be at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
