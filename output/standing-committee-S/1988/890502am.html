	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were stunned by the Conservative criticism that we often discuss clauses without tabling amendments. Therefore, to formalise the situation, we have tabled some amendments so that we may debate some of the issues involved now, and also on stand part later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our two amendments to clause 42 are probing amendments. We are concerned about "stopping the clock" when self-governing status is sought by a school board. In earlier debates we expressed our concern about staffing at the outset of the procedure to create a self-governing school. If the clock stops, there are transfer and movement problems and life is made very difficult for both the school and the education authority. Clause 42 is about the removal of property from a school by the education authority. In some respects, the clause is straightforward. However, there is the matter of the procedure that would be involved, which has been covered under clauses 33 to 41. We are concerned that that is written into statute. If the legislation exists, there is always a temptation to use it for some minor areas of property within a school. That may not be in the best interests of harmony between the school and the education authority at a particularly tense and difficult time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the added problem that the Government are intent on making it as difficult as possible for the education authority to do anything once the procedure has started. I understand the Government's concern about what the education authority may get up to in relation to both staff and property, but a balance must be struck, as the education of children cannot stop just because a school is seeking self-governing status. Clearly, an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1148</span>
element of movement of staff and property is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about what might happen if a piece of property—for example, a temporary hut—is used as temporary accommodation in a school. That facility, provided by the education authority, may be in school X one day and then removed to school Y two or three months later. It would be absurd if there were a debate about whether that should be the property of the education authority or should remain the property—at least at that stage—of the self-governing school. All those minor headaches would arise, and the best way to resolve them would be through discussion between the two parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill suggests that as soon as self-governing status is sought, war is declared between the two groups. That may or may not be the case. If a school is opting out because of potential closure, or after a period of bitter wrangling with the education authority, that may sow the seeds of trouble and discontent. However, I am assuming that other feelings will prevail and that the school and the education authority will have to consider the matter sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue that seems to be missing from debates in Committee and elsewhere is what happens to the children. The baseline for the Opposition—I am sure that Conservative Members share our view—is quality of education. Throughout the first part of the Bill, which deals with self-governing schools, there is the danger that discontent, irritation and trouble could be fomented, partly because of the nature of the school and partly because of the pressures that are now being enshrined in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the disruptive nature of the procedure for schools seeking to become self-governing. This provision is one more sign of potential problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that all the school's facilities, amenities and equipment would be handed over to the board of management when the school became self governing? Worry about the removal of equipment and disposal of assets could be detrimental to the future of the school. It is straightforward—the schools would just leave what is already there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable distinction between equipment and property. However, I referred to what is called "moveable property" in clause 42(1)—the portakabins and temporary accommodation which, sadly, litter so many of our school playing fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, despite our concerns about self-governing schools, that equipment already in the schools would stay there because it is required for the education of the children. However, moveable property gives rise to larger areas of concern. I have given one example of temporary accommodation to highlight that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman makes a reasoned case that common sense should, I hope, be an arbiter in such situations. However, I fear that, with the pressures
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1149</span>
and tension on both sides, redress through the courts and the commissioner may be the first port of call rather than the last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be caution when dealing with what are ostensibly minor considerations in the education of children and in the Bill. Nevertheless, such considerations could be a recipe for increased bitterness, tension and difficulties between the education authority and the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are probing amendments, designed to raise our concerns about that matter and to seek assurances from the Minister that there will always be a drive for reasonableness, without any prodding or encouragement to refer to the commissioner or to take court proceedings after deliberations between the two parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, these are probing amendments to ensure a debate on the important matter of the removal of property when a school moves from education authority control to self-governing status. The hon. Gentleman referred to stopping the clock. We hope that such transfers will not take place when, as the hon. Gentleman said, war has been declared. But he is correct that it could be a sensitive period, to use a neutral term, and a time of potential difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The head teacher will, in practice, have to resolve many of those problems. Parents, teachers and education authority officials will see him to discuss them. He will be in a possibly difficult but certainly responsible position and will have to take the decisions. That is not unusual for a head teacher, who is a key person in the education system. I have long been concerned about the general position of head teachers within the system. They have to take crucial decisions. The negotiating structure within the constraints of the Scottish joint negotiating committee has always seemed unsatisfactory—I received representations about it when I was involved in education—because the negotiators are negotiating on behalf of a much wider body of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the issues raised by the clause, on the removal of property from a school by an education authority. Much of the onus of responsibility will fall on the head teacher. The problem needs to be faced and the proper role of the head teachers recognised. They will be in the front line; they will be asked about the huts or whatever is to be moved. The sensitive nature of the problem underlines the serious responsibilities that Scottish head teachers have to bear throughout the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), I believe that the Committee should consider carefully this important matter and not accept the clause on the nod. These clauses are not technical clauses that should be passed on the nod and left to the Minister and civil servants to sort out. Subsection (1) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an education authority who have received a notice under section 13(6)".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
That is a written notice of the intention of a school board to ballot parents with a view to obtaining self-governing status. Under the clause, when an authority receives that notice it shall not
	<br><blockquote><p>"until one of the conditions specified in subsection (2) of section 38 of this Act is satisfied … remove or withdraw from the premises of that school any moveable property which is owned or held by that authority wholly or partly for the purposes of that school."</p></blockquote>
The three conditions outlined are, first, the prior consent of the school board. It is unlikely that the school board will consent to giving up valuable property that it holds on behalf of the education authority until the procedure is completed. The second condition is that the result of the ballot shows that the school does not have a simple majority in favour of self-governing status, which could take weeks or months. The third condition is that the proposal for self-governing status is rejected by the Secretary of State for Scotland, which may or may not be likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the clause amounts to a freeze on the recovery of any equipment by the education authority from a school once that school has shown its intention to ballot its parents on self-governing status. A series of questions remains to be answered. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) referred to temporary huts. That is important. Several schools in Dundee have been repeatedly subjected to fire— raising as a result of which classrooms have been destroyed. The education authority holds a stock of huts to provide temporary accommodation until the insurance claims enable it to do up the classrooms. Those temporary huts belong to the education authority, not to particular schools. A school board could try to gain possession of those huts because the ballot of parents might take place when the huts are on the school premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help the Committee and state how long the temporary accommodation is used in schools that have suffered in Dundee—one month, two months, one year, two years or three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That depends on the extent of the fire damage. Temorary huts can be in use for six months, a year, 18 months or two years. But the point of principle is still the same. The huts are not for the use of one school. The education authority loans huts out of its stock to any school under its control that may catch fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 42, a school board that is successful in a ballot and gains permission from the Secretary of State for Scotland to opt out, could retain ownership of the huts, even if it did not need them, until the commissioner for school assets made his decision. It should be made clear that some property should be returned to the education authority at that time, because a fire might occur in another education authority school, which then requires those huts. If the school board is unco-operative, the education authority may pre-empt its decision and take the huts away. The commissioner for school assets could then take it to court. That is worrying for anyone who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
genuinely wishes to avoid causing friction in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central is right that not everyone will be happy about the ballot procedure. The population connected to the school could be bitterly divided about it. The school board could be highly politically motivated and make decisions simply to upset the education authority. Those circumstances should be taken into consideration by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the fact that feelings may run high, can the hon. Gentleman give a commitment on the behalf of the Labour party and Labour-controlled education authorities that they would not use any power over property or buildings to influence the decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will explain to me how any education authority could use its power over buildings and property to influence the decision taken by parents in a ballot, I shall gladly respond. But I cannot understand the point that he is driving at. Can he give me a specific case in which the education authority is trying to influence parents by threatening them or through its ownership of property? If the hon. Gentleman's vivid imagination finds such a case, perhaps he will explain it to the Committee. I do not see the point of his vague intervention. Tory Governments and Tory authorities try to intimidate parents, trade unions and others, but Labour authorities have never been known for their intimidation. Tory authorities still intimidate the ordinary people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem does not rest with temporary huts. In Tayside we try to ensure that every classroom has a personal computer. As computer studies develop in secondary schools, far more sophisticated computers may be introduced for the use of pupils not only from that school but from other schools. Fifth and sixth-year pupils from all over the city may have access to such computers. What happens to that sophisticated computer system if the school in which it is located goes to the ballot? It will depend on the climate when the ballot takes place. If the school board is so animated against the education authority, it might not allow people from outside the school to gain access to the computer until the period of the freeze is over, which could damage the educational interests of children elsewhere in the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be problems in other areas, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Classics has been in decline since the 1950s or 1960s when nearly all senior secondary schools in Scotland had a classics department. That is no longer so in many education authority areas because of a decline in interest, and classics departments are now located in particular schools. Children who wish to take Higher or A-level classics often have to travel to other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I knew of one young girl who had to travel from Kirkton to Harris academy in Dundee. What would happen if the school with the classics department decided to acquire self-governing status? Not only would the teachers become employees of the board
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
of management but the department's resources— books, tapes and videos—might also transfer to the self-governing school. What right would the education authority have to gain access to those materials? The Minister must explain what would happen in such circumstances. Would the education authority retain ownership of the resources, which are important for all education authority schools, or would they pass to the school that happened to have them in its possession when it opted for self-governing status?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is particular concern in Scotland over computer studies and the number of companies who are keen to see the emergence of self-governing schools to do deals with them. The companies offer to provide computer equipment in exchange for being allowed to profit from it out of school hours when it is not being used for school purposes. Companies cannot do that with education authority schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trying to decide what belongs to self-governing schools or to education authority schools is a highly dubious business. Self-governing schools have the potential to turn the resources allocated to them to commercial profit. Any resources claimed by a school board for school purposes—for which no fee is charged—and which pass to a board of management could be used for profit, outwith school hours, not necessarily for the school itself but for the private sector sponsors with which it may have made deals. I find that offensive, and I am sure that most members of the Committee would, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a technical clause. It deals with the rights of education authorities and the schools that remain under their control. The equipment in any school at any given time has been paid for by the ratepayers and taxpayers. As such, it should go to the schools that decide to remain under the control of elected education authorities, but the Minister has decided to interrupt that arrangement by introducing the procedure for balloting to opt out. He neither sought nor received the permission of the Scottish people for the new procedure, but he is using it to steal from education authorities the property that they purchased for use by pupils in their sector. He seeks to transfer that property forcibly to a new sector of his own creation. In doing so, he could seriously damage the educational interests of children who remain in schools under education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must deal with the problems that I have outlined. If property that cannot be allocated to a particular school is held by one school on behalf of all the other schools in that area, it is important that all the other schools retain the right of access to computers, temporary huts, textbooks or whatever may belong to the education authority and the people of the area. The assets should not be the preserve of the small elite or clique which has opted for self-governing status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to an interesting exposition of the Labour party's views on the use of local assets. I am sure that it will make good reading and that it will be often quoted back to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that temporary classrooms have sometimes been necessary for the continuance of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
education throughout Tayside, not just in Dundee. However, it is nonsense to suggest that temporary means that they are in place for only a few weeks or months. I am reminded of the temporary prefabs that were built at the end of the second world war. People are still living in them today. I am sorry to say that some of the temporary classrooms, put up in times of difficulty, are still in use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noted that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) first outlined the reasons that he felf justified an education authority's removing huts or classrooms? He then refused to answer when I asked him to make a commitment that an education authority would not use its rights over the temporary classrooms to exert pressure on a school. I find that interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that could be an important factor in the decisions affecting a school. If an education authority states that the temporary classrooms are its accommodation and that it will remove them should the school become self-governing, that will have an impact on decision-making. Some people would consider that a form of blackmail, and that is what we wish to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is clear. If the accommodation, playing fields and facilities of a school are deemed to be necessary today because the school is under education authority control, I fail to see why the position should change tomorrow when it becomes a self-governing school. Surely, it is important that a school carries on with the minimum—and preferably no— disruption to the education of the children and to the available facilities. For example, land may have been designated for a school's expansion because of envisaged changes in the local community. If so, it would be wrong to dispose of that land because the education authority can point out that there are no buildings on it at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When planning for the future, one should recognise that changes will take place. There are schools in areas where the population is declining and there are schools in areas, such as Blairgowrie where I live, where the population is growing. The population in Blairgowrie is growing because it is a fine place to live. People want to live there. Like me, the hon. Member for Dundee, East will be pleased that Tayside and Dundee have at last been endorsed as being among the finest places to live in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me as my experience of Dundee is a bit longer than his.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of life in my area is second to none. We appear at number 3 in the table showing the results of the latest research. I am sure that also applies to our schools. Schools may have facilities and amenities, and among the reasons why people want to move to Blairgowrie are the community atmosphere and the amenities on offer. If schools
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
possess computers and other equipment, they should be used in the evening as well as during the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the tragedies of education is the limited use of facilities. I remember when a voluntary body had great difficulty in using school accommodation in the evenings. That seems to be bordering on the criminal, because the local community considers that the assets belong to it. Under the School Boards (Scotland) Act and this Bill, the local community will consider the school to be its own and will want to make maximum use of its facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East may wish to return to this matter later. He said that local authorities would not intimidate school boards on those matters, but a Derbyshire county council advertisement in the Derbyshire 	<i>Gazette</i> of 11 January 1989 told parents that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a £1.9 million building programme"</p></blockquote>
—for a school—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be scrapped if it opts out."</p></blockquote>
That was a false statement. The building programme would have gone ahead only if the school had opted out. the Bill must guard against such intimidatory behaviour by Labour-controlled local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend again for that helpful intervention. Local authorities' behaviour in England has caused us grave concern. I should not wish any Scottish education authority to behave in such a way. But sadly, when somebody appears to get away with something, the habit spreads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Gentleman, I agree that Dundee and Tayside are among the best places in Britain to live. Perhaps that is because they are controlled by a Labour administration at regional level. However, he seemed to suggest that the alleged abuse in England was spreading to Scotland. Where in Scotland has intimidation been used by a Labour authority against anyone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman often heard me speak about my concern for rural schools. There was a period under a Labour administration when rural schools in my area were starved of essential resources—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Dundee, East should be careful before debating this matter: his memory of Tayside and Dundee is not as long as mine. My political carreer in Dundee began in 1950, whereas the hon. Gentleman is a Johnny-come-lately. I remember vividly problems with the use of resources and assets. I have never suggested that the Labour administration of Dundee's old city council—the old "cooncil"—which covered education in those days, or of the regional authority, has had an adverse impact on the quality of life in Tayside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor do I claim that Tayside's quality of life is the result of Tory administrations. Not only does our area have natural assets but, long before the hon. Member for Dundee, East and I became involved in politics—before the second world war—far-seeing politicians gave us facilities that must have been the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
envy of the rest of the United Kingdom. Dundee was decades ahead of other cities, and we must be grateful for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East criticised one of these assets: the Harris academy. He has often suggested—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish what I am saying. It is on record that the hon. Gentleman has said that too many people want to go to the Harris academy for snobby reasons. I did not use that word. Like the Morgan academy, the Grove academy and Dundee high school, the Harris academy is a quality school which Dundee enjoys thanks to far-seeing people. The high school dates back hundreds of years. Those are the local assets that we inherited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about property under the school boards legislation, because politicians may take narrow views for political reasons at education authority level. They may not have the same far-seeing view as pre-war politicians, who were not motivated by partisan policies and were usually independents or liberals with a small "l". They left an inheritance in Dundee and Tayside that has resulted in the area being accorded the title of the third best place to live in the United Kingdom. We must bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, I want to draw attention to what my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said. I shall refer to the headmaster when we discuss later amendments, but I must say now that the headmaster will be caught up in the pressures exerted by the education authority when it wants to remove equipment and temporary classrooms—to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East referred— sell playing fields and try to stifle further development. The headmaster is effectively the manager of the school. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood that the headmaster in Scottish schools has not enjoyed the position that he should have had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend mentioned selling playing fields, Opposition Members giggled. In the London borough of Ealing, the Labour-controlled authority is selling playing fields to build houses. That is a real threat, and it is why we need to protect schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are discussing the removal of moveable property. Are playing fields moveable property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parts of playing fields could be listed as moveable property. [Hon. Members: "The goal posts."] I have in mind changing rooms, which are often portable buildings, and the goal posts. I do not want to follow the route suggested by my hon. Friend, but I am worried about what the hon. Member for Dundee, East put his finger on—temporary classrooms. They often become semi-permanent and it would be wrong if they were removed. We shall deal with this when discussing my later amendment,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
but the clause should retain the notion that an education authority will be in difficulty with the commissioner if it tries to remove what is essential to the school being able to continue tomorrow as it exists today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to bring us back to earth. These are probing amendments to try to clarify what could be a murky area in the Bill. The intentions behind them are modest. The idea that they give education authorities a veto over schools that are about to opt out is nonsensical. It is nonsense to attribute such motivation to education authorities in Scotland— and, moreover, that has nothing to do with the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments suggest that decisions about taking removal of property to court should be subject to the Secretary of State's approval. If they give a veto to anyone, it is to the Secretary of State and that should show why they are probing amendments. They do not more than re-state what is implicit in the clause and in schedule 9. The commissioner for school assets has some discretion when deciding whether to pursue an education authority for the removal of property, and acts under the orders of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has the ultimate discretion to decide whether a case should be pursued. What complexities does the Minister envisage might arise in that process? My hon. Friends have already mentioned possible difficulties with temporary huts or other moveable property such as computers. The local authority might have put items such as theatrical props in one school, intending that they be used by other schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a scenario to the hon. Gentleman? A school which is considering opting out has a number of computers, but there is a shortage of computers in the local authority area. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the local authority would be justified in removing those computers on the ground that that school was about to opt out of local authority control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be perfectly justifiable for a local authority, which has a duty to look after all the pupils in its area, to move computers out of the school that was opting out if that made those computers available to a wider body of pupils within that community. If the local authority transferred those computers to another school it could still make them available to the opted-out school, but it would prevent the opted-out school from denying access to them to other pupils for whom they had been originally intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman now realise that, even if we are not talking about intimidatory behaviour, even if the local authority is acting entirely in good faith, the scenario I described could enable a local authority, under any circumstances, to remove all or most of the moveable property in a school? A local authority can always argue that there is a shortage of books, computers, desks or temporary classrooms in any part of its area.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1157</span>
Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that that is why the clause as drafted is necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonaid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A local authority can always argue that, but we are talking about the bounds of reasonable argument. We do not suggest that the local authority should have absolute power to move property. We suggest that the Secretary of State should have some discretion in the interpretation of clause 42(1), which states that moving any moveable property could result in court action. We are trying to find out when the Secretary of State would consider it reasonable for a local authority to remove certain items of property if that made them more widely available to the body of pupils in the community. That discretion rests with the Secretary of State under clause 42, combined with schedule 9. We are hoping to elicit from the Minister some recognition that it is not a case of "either/or" or of black and white, because there are some grey areas. Where does he see those grey areas? Where would he consider it right to allow the local authority to move some of the property that has been used by a particular school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary. The commissioner will raise an action against an education authority only if he believes that it has some chance of success. Under clause 42(3) the court can grant decree in his favour only if he has previously issued an interim certificate under clause 36. An interim certificate is issued only when there has been a dispute between the commissioner and the education authority. Such a dispute must be referred to the Secretary of State, who then has to determine it. He is required under clause 36(2) to consult the education authority before making his determination. A commissioner would be unlikely to go to such lengths to recover trivial amounts; but if he did so, the Secretary of State could, under clause 36, end the matter by determining in the authority's favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything that the amendment is designed to achieve would be achieved in practice under clauses 36 and 42. Therefore, I invite the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to withdraw his amendment.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) stressed the new responsibilities that head teachers will have. After receiving representations from the Headteachers Association and the Association of Head Teachers, the Government are to inform both the management and the teachers' side of the Scottish joint negotiating committee on further education that we are considering legislation to empower the Secretary of State to remove deputy head teachers and head teachers from the SJNC negotiating machinery, which deals with schoolteachers' pay and conditions of service. We recognise that head teachers have a key management role and that they will have additional responsibilities and powers. The system should reflect that. We understand the frustration
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
felt by members of both associations, which led them to ask the Government to take action. Both organisations are expected to support the Government's decision unanimously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that head teachers will welcome that decision warmly. Will the Government introduce such legislation in this Bill, or in a future Bill? Will my hon. Friend comment on the timetable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall write to both the management and the teachers' side of the SJNC today. They should have an opportunity to comment on the proposals. The Government expect them to respond by 25 May, which will allow sufficient time to table the necessary amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three weeks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should recognise that both the Association of Head Teachers and the Headteachers Association have requested the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that some head teachers are not members of either association? Has he consulted members of the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we decide to proceed, I believe that more head teachers will join the HTA and the AHT, because they will have a new role. The SJNC has not recognised the position of head teachers and we must remedy that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked whether temporary huts that are moved from school to school would be caught by a freeze on the movement of property. The Bill requires that the school board consent to any freeze, and that such consent should not be unreasonably withheld. Even the hon. Gentleman would probably admit that a school board would protect its own school's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I detected a conflict in the arguments advanced by the Opposition when we discussed grants. I think that the hon. Member for Dundee, East said that he was opposed to self-governing schools, but did not want them disadvantaged. He wanted them to have the same security as education authority schools. Yet he has performed a volte-face with his position on essential moveable equipment for schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no such conflict. I am worried that education authority schools will be disadvantaged, and I want to press the Minister on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to see how education authority schools could be disadvantaged by equipment remaining at a school when, in the opinion of its board, the school needed that equipment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A self-governing school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1159</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether a school is self governing or controlled by the education authority, it is still a state school and should have the appropriate equipment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend notice that when the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) raised the issue of temporary classrooms, and I asked him to give a commitment that education authorities would not use such classrooms to put pressure on schools considering opting out, he refused to do so, and ducked the question? The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) gave circumstances in which he thought that education authorities would be justified in taking away moveable articles from a school that was considering opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that, but I was not suprised. I also noticed the distinction that the hon. Member for Dundee, East made between Labour-controlled authorities in Scotland and those south of the border, as if there were two types of Socialist and two types of Labour party. The only difference between the actions of Labour-controlled authorities on either side of the border that I am aware of is that Scottish authorities have not had the chance to act, because the legislation has not yet been passed by Parliament. I expect Scottish authorities to behave in the same way, although we welcome the progressive developments in Strathclyde, led by Charles Gray, and in similar Labour authorities. The argument may have been won, because recent policy papers produced by the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) have a flavour that I recognise. Whenever we mention those policy papers, the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Dundee, East leap up and say that they apply only to England. If such division among the Opposition continues, the prospects of electoral success for the Conservatives north of the border will improve day by day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shows a sense of humour today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that, like the Labour party with its education policy, we start from a low base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) asked about books and tapes for special classes. The hon. Member for Western Isles mentioned theatre props, and asked where the responsibility for ownership rested and how it would be determined. Where such equipment is used by more than one school and cannot be apportioned between the education authority and the board of management, paragraph 2(2)(b) to schedule 8 will apply. The equipment would either be retained by the education authority or transferred to the board of management, depending on which of them would be likely to make the greater use of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked whether there should be a discussion between the school board and the education authority during the opt-out process. I think that there should be, and that the commissioner's first task should be to try to get agreement with the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the rules of clause 42 which deal with moveable property as
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
opposed to equipment. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North noted that a school's equipment is only one example of moveable property. A school board will doubtless consider reasonably a request for the withdrawal of some items of moveable property, such as a portakabin used for temporary works at a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help but note that an amendment paper that previously contained one or two amendments on four or five technical clauses now bristles with technical amendments which arouse great interest in debate. My hon. Friends will no doubt mention the obvious implication of that during the timetable debate on the Floor of the House tomorrow evening. The sudden emergence of those amendments is a prime example of the Opposition's desire to delay the progress of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister attribute the same desire to delay the progress of the Bill to those of his hon. Friends who have spoken to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to lend the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) the transcript of the interview that the hon. Member for Dundee, East did for the BBC radio programme "Good Morning Scotland". In the interview—which, typically, contained no balancing response—the hon. Gentleman announced to an astonished Scotland that he would be talking though the night on Report to delay the progress of the Bill because there was nothing else to be done. I am sure that one of his hon. Friends will take him to one side and explain how the guillotine procedure works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forgive me that digression, Mr. Martin. The amendment achieves no purpose and is unnecessary. The hon. Member for Fife, Central should withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments are always interesting if frequently wide of the mark. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is well aware of the guillotine procedure. What a pity that the experienced team of parliamentarians on the Government side have had to resort to a guillotine to end discussion on a Bill that is considered uniquely objectionable in Scotland. We intend to continue the campaign in Scotland against the Bill even after it has progressed through its Report stage and through the House of Lords. The Minister may be worried about the present low base of electoral support for the Government in Scotland, but we are out to make that base even lower as the weeks and months go by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Fife, Central knows what happens when a guillotine is imposed. However, the transcript of the radio interview, which I should be happy to let him study, shows that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) does not, as he clearly believes that he will be able to talk all night. The transcript buries the hon. Member for Dundee, East under his own words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the intervention of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
However, I am here to praise my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East, not to bury him. I suspect that the extravagant language of Conservative Members does not do justice to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about head teachers. An interesting, ad hoc development this morning was that, because of the representations that he has received, the Minister is to write to both management and teaching sides of the SJNC to suggest that head teachers and assistants be removed from the consultation procedure. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East rightly asked whether there had been such a welter of representation from the SSTA and the EIS on that subject. I shall give way to the Minister so that he can tell the Committee what representations he has received from those organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the Headteachers Association and the Association of Head Teachers have written to the Government urging us to take the necessary powers during the passage of the Bill. They expressed dissatisfaction with the Scottish joint negotiating committee on further education, which they believe does not adequately represent the interests of their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was also great resentment about and dissatisfaction with the EIS's handling of head teachers' pay claims. Moreover, at its last conference, the EIS went as far as to pass a motion asserting that all teachers should be paid the same, regardless of their responsibilities. Its national policy has been to squeeze differentials, which has caused resentment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention confirms that there has been no discussion with the EIS or the SSTA. The Minister and his hon. Friends are right to seek to reward excellence, commitment and positive contributions to education, from the youngest recruits to the profession to head teachers in large comprehensives—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is straying from the terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is connected with head teachers, Mr. Martin. I hope that you will show me the leniency that you showed the Minister when you allowed him during this morning's debate to make a major contribution about a change in administrative policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously, the Government's new interest in head teacher's problems is coupled with a major attack later in the Bill on the conditions of service of lecturers in further education. That will be exacerbated by registration and the possible introduction of licensed teachers in Scotland. The Government are effectively launching a major general attack on the Scottish teaching profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not fully understood what I said. He said that there will be a major attack on further education lecturers later in the Bill, but I propose only to put head teachers
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
in the same position as that proposed for further education lecturers. Thus, their pay will not be determined by a statutory body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is far too wide of the amendment, which is about the removal of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The removal of property, Mr. Martin, impinges on the responsibilities of head teachers and deputies—the principal actors in schools. I am conscious of staining your tolerance, Mr. Martin, but the Minister is proposing to give a form of reward to headteachers, and that must be seen in the context of the whole teaching profession. Later provisions affect further education lecturers. If they are to lose their joint negotiating machinery, they will be on the same level as head teachers. That is not logical. It does not square with further educationists' expectations of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition supports all teachers, including head teachers. The creation or further divisions in Scottish education is unhelpful to the Committee's deliberations and to the difficult period ahead, with the implementation of proposals on both school boards and self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is a team effort. We deplore the fact that special treatment is being given to one section of the teaching commnity without due regard to the implications for the major teaching unions or for the quality of service and the morale of the teaching profession generally. I have exhausted your tolerance, Mr. Martin, on this item, but those points had to be made. This is not the moment for this initiative to be introduced. It smacks of creating further divisions in Scottish education. However, that is consistent with the Government's overall policy, so no one should be surprised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by bringing him back to the amendment. I wish to be fair to him, as the 	<i>Official Report</i> will be studied closely. I know that he will accept that, whatever our differences on the issue, the children and their education in a school that is considering opting-out must come first. On behalf of the Labour party, will he give a commitment that Labour-controlled education authorities will not seek to remove property, either for intimidatory reasons or for what they might consider to be good reasons? For example, there maybe a shortage of computers in the education authority as a whole and the authority could be worried about losing control of one if the school opts out. That commitment would be useful for parents in schools that might consider opting-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention requires two responses. First, any action taken in Scotland will be by Labour education authorities, as there are no Conservative authorities to undertake any activity on behalf of any child in Scotland. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman is besotted by the press coverage of the handful of schools in England which have decided to opt out. The hon. Gentleman wishes to transfer potential or perceived problems to the Scottish context. He is a million miles wide of the mark. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
would be helpful if the Minister gave him not only a press briefing but a tutorial on Scottish education; on the qualities of our system and the responsibilities exercised by Labour-controlled education authorities and others with no overall control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that, beneath that load of waffle, the answer is "Yes", and that the hon. Gentleman can guarantee that Labour education authorities will not seek to intervene in such a way. May I have such a categoric answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer is that Labour-controlled education authorities have always exercised their responsibilities carefully and sensitively in the interests of children and parents. That will not change because of the Bill. Scotland will need a greater degree of strength and sensibility to ensure that Scottish education thrives and comes first when this piece of political nonsense is stuck where it should be—on the damp, dingy shelves of St. Andrew's House. If that is the answer that the hon. Gentleman seeks, I reaffirm that Scottish authorities will continue to be as responsible as they have been for years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the answer is that local authorities will not intervene in the way that I described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether that is a form of tautology or torture. I think that the hon. Gentleman heard me say that Opposition Members do not need lectures about the English experience. About 50 out of more than 5,000 schools have decided to opt out. There does not seem to be a flurry of English schools rushing to opt out these days. I see that I am encouraging the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) to wish to speak. A number of schools could be discontented with a change that took place in earlier years, and now seek to return to a grant-maintained system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I inform the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) that education in Scotland is different and education authorities always act responsibly. In the delivery of any service, differences of opinion will always arise between councillors and bureaucracy or those they represent, or between teachers and elected members and the bureaucracies that administer the service. That is understandable and necessary and a natural dynamic in any system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not got through to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) that Scottish education is very different from English education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may wish to discuss that general point with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has spent a long time not answering the reasonable question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). In his answer to my hon. Friend's question "yes"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members sit down; I rise. The weather is fine, and I expect that we can
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
carry on like this for a while. Simple points are clearly the most difficult for Conservative Members to absorb, so I shall reiterate the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how sensible Scottish education authorities will be when faced with a school seeking self-governing status. Scottish education authorities will continue to be as responsible as they have been. Any discussions about moveable property or equipment should take place in a context in which the needs of children in the self-governing school are catered for to the same standard as those of children who remain in the local authority sector. That is the principal point which the Under-Secretary has stressed during our sittings, time without number. That is a comprehensive answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does it mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a subtle difference between what it means and its comprehensiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes or no? Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there will be no use of intimidatory tactics such as have been used in the south by seeking to prevent opted-out schools continuing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the provocation of some of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked a specific question. Unfortunately, questions from the Minister always have two parts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for an Opposition Member to describe Conservative Members as gangsters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just on the borderline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked an important question, but, as always with he Minister's questions, there are always two parts. I shall not compare the situation in Scotland with that in England. I have only read about the press coverage given to these so-called incidents, problems and intimidation in England, but I can say that there will be no intimidation in Scotland by Scottish education authorities to schools seeking self-governing status. I can be no clearer than that, and it should settle any lingering doubts that Conservative Members may have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to withdraw the amendment because we have had a reasonable discussion on our worries about the distraught state of affairs that may ensue if a school seeks self-governing status. That is part and parcel of part I. It is political nonsense, educationally divisive and has no place in Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1165</span>
The issues that we have raised have at least allowed us to debate what we regard as key, live issues—not technical points—which will arise if any Scottish school decides to opt out. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 280, in page 28, line 2, after "him" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or by the board of management.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is straightforward, and I hope that the Committee will see that it makes sense. Under clause 42(2)(b), the commissioner may recover
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenditure reasonably incurred by him as a result of"</p></blockquote>
any action that he has had to take in the removal of school property. The amendment includes the school board in that category, because it may incur expenditure as a result of the removal. I shall not go into our earlier debate about headmasters, but a headmaster working in conjunction with the school board could also incur expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that we had just completed a reasonable discussion on the two previous amendments. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) wants to speak to my amendment, but I do not know that, when he was interviewed by the BBC, he clearly showed again what has sadly been the case in much of our discussion on the Bill—that Opposition Members do not understand parliamentary procedures, rules and conventions and have got themselves into the most appalling muddle. He certainly got himself in another appalling muddle when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What I would argue is that when it comes back for its Report stage"—</p></blockquote>
that is, my amendment and the rest of the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which is an open-ended stage in Parliament, that we make every effort to ensure that that debate goes on for as long as it takes and if that means going through the night and into the next day and disrupting the next day's business, then we do that".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman was displaying the sort of ignorance that has been so apparent throughout the proceedings of the Committee; the absence of an old hand with his hand on the helm to keep the Opposition from going adrift has been very noticeable. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman will live to regret that and many other statements, because, when he stands for re-election at the next general election he will realise that all the interesting things that he has said in Committee will have been noted. Equally, I realise that everything that I say will be noted, but that does not worry me because I always make sure that I say the same things down here as I say in Scotland. I also make sure that I am in order and that we are debating matters properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is typical of the sort of amendment that I care about in that it concerns the situation in which a school board may find itself. If we create a school board, and, as the result of legislation, give parents the opportunity to have a school board, the people who stand for election to it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
must feel absolutely sure that any expense that they incur as the result of the removal or withdrawal of school property is recoverable. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) defend himself as always knowing what he is about. He is asking the Committee and the Minister to accept that any expenses incurred by a school board should be reimbursed, yet he has failed to give an example of the sort of expenses that it might incur under the clause. Everyone knows that expenses will be involved, but they are still waiting for him to give an example of the kind of expenditure that a board may incur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 36, the commissioner for school assets decides whether action should be taken. Before he take any action, he must go to the Secretary of State for Scotland who then consults the local authorities and makes a determination. Only after that will the commissioner for school assets raise the case in the courts. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North will explain where in that process the board incurs expenses, I shall consider whether the amendment is justified for inclusion in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman made no reference to the type of expenses that may be incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, I do not understand parliamentary procedure as well as the hon. Member for Tayside, North does—I have been here a much shorter time than he has—but I represent people from Dundee, East in Parliament. I do not represent Parliament in Dundee, East, unlike the hon. Gentleman, who represents Parliament in Tayside, North, rather than the other way around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at one of our earliest sittings, I am determined to ensure that we debate the Bill properly. The only prerequisite for any Scottish Member of Parliament is that the legislation should be examined in detail, line by line, and given proper consideration. I do not accept that a false majority, such as that which the hon. Member for Tayside, North will have behind him on Wednesday night, can cut short an important and legitimate debate on this Bill which affects the people of Scotland and, more importantly, the education system in Scotland. I shall take whatever steps I can to defend the interests of the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) speaks, I ask that we get back to the amendment. While hon. Members' records may be impressive, they have nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East should realise that the motivation for the amendment is that I can be seen to be protecting the interests of those people in my constituency who decide that their schools should become self-governing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should read the clause and the amendment. We have already agreed that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
commissioner can recover his expenses. If the board also incurs expenses it should, on the same principle, be able to recover them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again the hon. Member for Tayside, North shows his ignorance. He could not have been listening. Perhaps his earphones are not working. My point is that he must explain how the boards will incur expenditure. As the Bill stands, I do not see where they will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenditure will be incurred by the commissioner for school assets. He will take action against an education authority which, it is believed, is not falling in line with the spirit of the legislation in terms of the transfer of moveable property from the self-governing school to the education authority. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North will explain where the boards incur expenditure, we can consider the amendment. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Tayside, North if he can give an example of the kind of expenditure which a board can incur under this procedure. The hon. Gentleman is ducking below the table—I do not know whether that is from embarrassment. He does not want to intervene, because he does not know of an instance in which a board may incur such expenditure. If so, why has he moved an amendment to that effect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is wasting the Committee's time. I expect him to take my side in the guillotine debate tomorrow night and fight for the people of Scotland by ensuring that the Committee's proceedings are not cut short. The Minister accused people such as the hon. Member for Tayside, North of filibustering and deliberately delaying the Committee's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I am doing is filibustering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked when a board would be likely to incur expenditure. Without being patronising, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that one of the problems of living with legislation when it is enacted is that people often cannot recover reasonable costs. It happens all the time with individuals who get caught up in various planning problems. If they resort to recovering their costs, they can incur legal costs and moving costs. This simple amendment takes care of all that. It makes sure that any reasonable costs can be recovered from the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In keeping with what the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, I hope that an education authority will respond in a reasonable way. If it does, there will be no case, but, if there is a problem, a school board must be able to recover expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Opposition were to behave in the same way as the hon. Member for Tayside, North, we would be accused of filibustering. We certainly would if we read through the Bill for every instance in which we could say, "Just in case something might happen, we will add this," and were still unable to explain the circumstances in which the amendment would be valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given the hon. Member for Tayside, North three opportunities to explain the costs that a school
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
board may incur. He says legal costs, but I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 42(2) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an education authority have removed or withdrawn any property in contravention of subsection (1) above, the commissioner for school assets…may raise against the authority an action."</p></blockquote>
It does not say the school board, but the commissioner for school assets will incur legal costs. So how can the school board ask for legal costs to be recovered? I shall be delighted to understand how I am misinterpreting the clause. The hon. Member for Tayside, North has yet to explain what legal action the school board will take under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North also mentioned moving costs. What are the moving costs? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that hon. Gentlemen are embarrassed and want me out of the room to vote in the division in Committee Room 9, but I shall not go. I shall continue to attack the absurd amendment that has been tabled by the hon. Members for Tayside, North and for Eastwood. If the hon. Member for Eastwood wishes to give me an example of costs that might be incurred, I shall gladly give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will speak when the hon. Gentleman has finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously trying to rescue the hon. Member for Tayside, North, who cannot hear him from that side of the Committee. Perhaps he could use a loud stage whisper so that his hon. Friend can answer my questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the moving costs? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It seems that the Minister has an answer and wishes to pass it to the hon. Member for Tayside, North to rescue him from his embarrassment. At least the Minister seems to understand the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the moving costs that a school board may incur? As I understand it, the education authority may take moveable property away, so it would incur moving costs. I see that the hon. Member for Tayside, North has his answer from the Minister or from the civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I did not need any message. I wanted to see how far he would follow his argument. I shall quote the hon. Gentleman's words back to him, which he will not like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, he referred to computers. If a school board finds that computers have been removed, but wishes to continue the existing curriculum, it will have to hire computers. That is the sort of reasonable expense that may be incurred. The hon. Gentleman himself referred to computers. I have a long list of other examples, but computers are good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North now suggests that an education authority will take property from any schools without legal authority. As soon as any school gives written notice of its intention to hold a ballot, nothing can be moved. The education authority knows that, and it will have legal advisers to advise it. However, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1169</span>
hon. Gentleman's amendments assumes that every education authority in Scotland is capable of breaking the law deliberately and in contravention of legal advice. But is there a chief executive in the country who would advise an education authority to break the law to remove property to which it did not have legal entitlement? If there is not, the hon. Gentleman has just slugged all chief executives. If any authority undertakes action that is outwith its powers, the school may be surcharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 42 describes the legal process by which the commissioner for school assets will force an education authority to accept his decision about whether property should belong to self-governing school or the education authority. In that legal process, the commissioner for school assets will be involved in legal action and will have to recover the costs. I assume that the Minister knew that and that that was why his civil servants advised him that clause 42(2)(b) should cover costs incurred by the commissioner for school assets instead of those incurred by him, the school board or the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is serious about the amendment, it should not just state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or by the board of management".</p></blockquote>
It should also include the education authority. In a legal case, the court could decide in favour of the education authority and against the commissioner for school assets. In those circumstances, why did the hon. Gentleman not include the education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways, unless he is suggesting that it is right for the Committee and the Government to be partial in favour of school boards and against education authorities, which may act more legally than the commissioner for school assets. The hon. Gentleman should think matters through before he wastes the Committee's time on such amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not think on his feet. In doing that, he digs more holes for himself to fall into. He should realise that something must happen before the commissioner acts. Under clause 42, the commissioner is given powers should the education authority do something that is considered to be against the interests of the school; for example, if it removed property. If the education authority removed some computers, the school might not have the equipment that it needed to perform some tasks. It is that type of expense that the amendment covers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has, at last, described the purpose of the amendment. I have tried for 10 to 15 minutes to find the answer, and it is only after the Minister slipped a piece of paper to the hon. Gentleman that he came up with an answer. I do not know whether the Minister knew the answer or whether it was supplied by a civil servant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that we now see the rationale for the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tayside,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1170</span>
North, but which was not explained when he moved it. The rationale is flawed. Why is the hon. Gentleman only interested in defending the position of the board of management? Why is he not worried about defending the position of the education authority? It never occurred to me that such an amendment was necessary. It occurred to the hon. Member for Tayside, North, but it was only after 15 minutes that he described the reason. I want to know why he thinks that the costs incurred by the boards of management should be covered, but not those incurred by an education authority even if a court has found in its favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An education authority's expenditure comes from the taxpayers and poll tax payers. Those people will now know that the hon. Member for Tayside, North does not care whether their money is wasted because an education authority is not allowed to recover it even when it is in the right. The hon. Gentleman is happy to see that money go down the drain, but he is prepared to do all in his power to protect the boards of management. That is sad. The amendment is seriously flawed, and I hope that the Minister will think carefully before accepting it. It needs tightening up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has made an incredible meal of the amendment. It is straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers disputes. When they occur, the board of management may incur expenditure either by making representations to the commissioner to ask him to take action, or by covering the costs of property removed because of a dispute about its ownership. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) gave a good example. It is not inconceivable that there could be a dispute about the ownership of computers that were part of a general education programme rather than specific to one school. In such circumstances, a board of management might incur expenditure, so it is reasonable that it should have the opportunity to recoup that expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept the amendment. It is a sensible proposal covering an important but limited point, which is not worth an endless, wide-ranging debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that the response of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was a reaction to being caught out and was intended to cover his embarrassment about the guillotine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert on the hon. Gentleman's psychology. I also read the text with considerable interest but I know that you, Mr. Martin, would not regard favourably any further references to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for tabling the amendment. It will strengthen significantly the remedies available to a commissioner for school assets if he is ever faced with the situation where an education authority has

	<span class='label label-info column'>1171</span>
removed or withdrawn, without the consent of the school board, moveable property pertaining to a school in the process of seeking self-governing status, unauthorised asset-stripping by an education authority could cause considerable inconvenience and additional expenditure for a board of management which, as a first step on incorporation, might have to restock with essential equipment. The amendment would enable a commissioner for school assets to recover damages sustained by the board of management as a result of the education authority's unauthorised activities, in addition to the value of the property itself. I welcome the amendment, which I am pleased to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still waiting for an explanation. If a board of management incurs expenditure in making representations and the court finds in its favour, it is able to recover that expenditure, so why cannot an education authority do likewise under the clause? A board might incur expenses in moving property, but similarly an education authority might also incur expenses to recover property stolen from it by self-governing schools. There are resource centres in most major centres, which provide equipment and materials for the use of schools under education authority control. It is not beyond belief that a school could borrow equipment just before opting for self-governing status and then refuse to return it. The education authority would then have to incur expenses in getting the equipment back. If the Minister believes that it is right to reimburse school boards and boards of management, the principle should also apply to education authorities. I should be grateful for an explanation of why it should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What exactly did the Minister mean when he spoke of reimbursing a board of management for making representations? It is not the same as reimbursement for representations made to a court. I imagine that representations made to a commissioner will involve a letter and a stamp, so where is the expenditure.

	<div class='title'>EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 28, line 10, leave out "shall" and insert "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 43(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where, immediately before the incorporation date in relation to any school, an educational endowment is to any extent vested in an education authority solely for the purposes of the school, the endowment shall, on that date and to that extent, be transferred to and vest for the same purposes in the board of management of the school."</p></blockquote>
We would substitute "shall" with "may" because we can envisage circumstances in which those who gave an endowment to a school would be unhappy if that endowment went to a self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example from my experience. Maurice McManus, an ex-Labour councillor and ex-Lord Provost of Dundee, left a citizenship award to Kirkton high school in the area that he represented. The award involves giving a trophy and a small amount of money to the pupil regarded as the best citizen in that year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maurice McManus took part in the 1926 general strike. He was a striking miner and during the 1920s and 1930s was blacklisted by the mine owners—the class of people to whom the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that the people of Dundee should be grateful. The class that gave us Dundee high school also gave us blacklisting, and the people such as Maurice McManus suffered under the blacklist that operated then. He came to Dundee from Fife and worked his way up from delivering coal to becoming a local councillor and Lord Provost. He was a tremendous success—a legend in his lifetime. I had the great privilege of helping him in 1982 during the last election in which he took part. He died shortly afterwards. He was loved by everyone in his area and the award that he left meant much to the local people as well as to himself and his family. He believed passionately in Socialism, in comprehensive education and in equality of opportunity. He despised the old selective system of education and the idea that pupils of the age of 12 should be discriminated against because they failed or passed exams that they had to sit at such a young age. He would have despised this Bill, which the Minister is keen to push through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be an affront to Maurice McManus if the citizenship award for pupils, in support of the comprehensive sector, were awarded to a school that had turned its back on comprehensive education by obtaining self-governing status and that had reintroduced academic selection. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am getting a bad voting record in Committee Room 9, but it is more important that we get this matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I knew Maurice McManus—he would not have supported the Bill or the reintroduction of academic selection. He would bitterly resent the award that commemorates his name and his contribution to the fight in Dundee being given to a school that had turned its back on what he stood for in a lifetime of service to the Labour party and Socialism.

The clause should at least provide flexibility. It should not provide that the award must go, but that it may go to the self-governing school if that were appropriate. In some circumstances it will be inappropriate for endowments or awards to be given to self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other cases, apart from Dundee. A classics prize may have been left by a classics teacher to encourage the study of classics in schools serving that community. In Dundee in the old days, senior secondaries served a wide community; people all over the city could attend them. But that is not the case with self-governing schools, because access will be by whatever criteria the board of management decides. It could reintroduce academic selection and virtually control who gets into the school. It would be inappropriate for a classics prize left for the children of an area to be allocated to a school that took pupils from only a small, narrow section of that community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An endowment may be left to encourage multicultural education. A self-governing school may opt out of education authority control and change the denominational character of the school to reflect a narrow religious group. It could become a Moslem, Protestant, Presbyterian or Catholic school and thus keep people out because of its curriculum. It would be inappropriate for a prize meant to encourage multicultural education to be awarded to such a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose a prize were left by someone who wanted to encourage sex education in schools, to be used by the education authority across the whole area, but a school decided to opt out, changed to a single-sex school and shunned the very idea of sex education. It may not want to teach children of that tender age about sex and AIDS. It would be inappropriate for that prize to be allocated to that school, but that could happen under the subsection. Prizes and endowments that were totally inappropriate would have to be given to a self-governing school because they were located there when the person handed them over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit of endowments left by individuals for education is to encourage all the children in an area. They may be for one given school, but that school would serve the whole of the area when the endowment was left and would not select from a narrow range of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to accept this modest amendment. The matter should be left to discretion and should not be enforced by legislation. The Minister should accept that in some circumstances it would be inappropriate for a prize or endowment to be given to a self-governing school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The meaning of clause 43(1) is, at least, clear. It means that, where an educational endowment is vested in an education authority and the endowment exists solely for the purposes of a particular school, the administration of the endowment is to be transferred to the board of management when the school becomes self-governing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has argued the contrary view, namely that the education authority should retain control of the endowment, although that does not make much sense. However, the amendment neither opens the gate nor shuts it; it just leaves it swinging on its hinges. It does not say whether the education authority or the board of management is to administer the endowment. Nor does it say who is to decide or how decisions will be made. The amendment would not improve the Bill from any angle, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the example that the hon. Gentleman gave, many people who left endowments to some of our older schools would have been worried—had they been alive—by events post-1969. But I imagine that most people leave endowments for educational purposes in a particular school and leave it to the best judgment of those responsible for the schools' administration to decide how that is delivered. No school will become self-governing unless it commands the support of the parents concerned. Schools are to serve children and to meet parents' responsibilities, and it is appropriate that the administration of an educational endowment should be done by the board of management rather than some remote authority. I am not sure whether the amendment would do what the hon. Gentleman thinks it would do. Even if it did, I would still invite him to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's answer. He complained that the amendment leaves the clause swinging on its hinges. That is an imprecise way to describe what is wrong with an amendment. On many occasions, members from both sides of the Committee have suggested technically flawed amendments, which the Minister was prepared to accept or to introduce later in another form, so that the principal enshrined in the amendment would be implemented by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that people leave educational endowments on the basis that they should serve educational purposes. I did not argue to the contrary. I accept also that those people leave it to the better judgment of those involved in educational administration to decide how the endowment should best be used. However, when they left the endowment they clearly understood that the education authority was responsible for that. The Minister has now introduced a new concept of boards of management. Although the Minister argues that no school will be run by a board of management unless it is declared the will of the majority of parents, the Bill does not suggest that that is so. The Bill says that a simple majority of the votes cast will be sufficient for the Secretary of State for Scotland to decide to allow the school to opt for self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although pressed several times, the Minister has refused to give any sign of the criteria that the Secretary of State would use in deciding that a simple majority of votes cast in a ballot were sufficient grounds for allowing a school to opt out. As usual, the Minister is doing everything in his power to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1175</span>
improve the position of self-governing schools at the expense of schools that are left under education authority control. That is why he is resisting a moderate amendment, which does not alter the balance but tries to maintain equality between the treatment of self-governing and education authority schools. It tries to protect the position of those who make educational endowments so that their endowments are not used in a sector of education to which they would have been bitterly opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Minister fails to understand. He is besotted with the idea that his huge parliamentary majority gives him sufficient strength to do as he likes in education in Scotland. He fails to understand that the wishes of the Scottish people are also important, and that, in spite of the huge majority, he still has a responsibility for listening to their wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the wishes of those making endowments are protected. The commissioner for school assets or some other neutral body could easily resolve which endowments would be appropriate to go to the self-governing school and which would not and should return to the education authority. The Minister is saying that he does not want it done because he wants to ensure that the self-governing school is strengthened as far as possible. He is not concerned whether that strengthening is fair or unfair, or whether Scottish people or the parents and pupils in any area want it. He is out to be unfair and has a majority enabling him to force it through. We shall withdraw the amendment, rather than be defeated in another Division, but we do not accept that the Minister can give no arguments while refusing to accept the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 28, line 21, leave out subsection (3). This amendment is similar to amendment No. 297, in that it is a probing amendment that seeks to discover how the scheme would operate. The notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>Subsection (3)</i> provides for the situation where an educational endowment is held by an education authority for the benefit of all or some of the schools in their area, or for the pupils attending those schools (and thus would not transfer to the board of management of a self-governing school) and ensures that, although the endowment will remain fully under the control of the education authority, the authority is to remain under an obligation to apply the endowment for the benefit of any school in its area which becomes self-governing, or, as the case may be, for its pupils, as if the school was still managed by the authority.</p></blockquote>
That refers to endowments not allocated to particular schools, but given to the education authority to administer on behalf of all or some of the schools in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Roch cup, a sports cup in Dundee, is administered by the education authority, some on behalf of Catholic primary schools in the area, others on behalf of primary schools in the area. However, it would be wrong for an education authority to discriminate and decide that a self-governing school would not be allowed to enter a team for a particular competition, because the cup had been left for all the Catholic primaries or all the primaries in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
Perhaps the Minister would explain where such discrimination would take place. Most areas have school orchestras which perform well and allow all the children from the area to learn musical instruments and take part together in concerts. It is a valuable contribution. I do not believe that education authorities would use school orchestras to keep out self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-governing schools could remain under the state education system and under the direct control of the Secretary of State for Scotland, clearly still in the public sector. But, from what has been said so far in Committee, and particularly from the contributions of Conservative Back-Bench Members, it is clear that they will not be satisfied if self-governing schools remain part of the state sector and directly under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland. They are keen for those schools to move further away from the state sector and acquire independent status, albeit independent status with direct funding from central Government. I should be unhappy with the idea that schools that move from the state sector towards independence should continue to benefit from the general endowments available to state schools in a given area.

It is a fundamental principle that parents who are not prepared to send their children to the same schools as other citizens but seek to buy a better deal—it must be a better deal involving privilege because they do not want to buy the same deal— should do so without assistance. If it is intended that the subsection should apply not only to self-governing schools that remain in the state sector but to those that go one stage beyond into the independent sector, I should be very unhappy for it to remain in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to understand the reasoning behind the amendment. Clause 43(3) is designed to ensure that where an education authority has to administer an educational endowment for the benefit of all the schools or of any group of the schools in its area, and one of those schools opts out, the pupils at the opted-out school are to continue to benefit from the endowment to exactly the same extent as they would have done if the school had remained under the management of the education authortiy. That means that pupils at self-governing schools will continue to benefit from the area endowment schemes, which are administered by education authorities throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying principle is very much the same as that embodied in clause 24. Clause 24 provides that where education authorities have a duty or a power to provide any benefits or services for pupils at schools under their management and at self-governing schools, the authority is not to discriminate between the two categories of pupils. The Opposition did not challenge that principle, and whatever view they take of self-governing schools, I should not have thought that they would want pupils to be penalised when a school opts out, which would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1177</span>
be the effect of the amendment. For that reason, I cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer is what I expected, as he was reading the newspaper instead, of listening to what I was saying. I said that the amendment was not intended to penalise pupils who remain in the self-governing sector under direct state education control. He will not be happy with the Bill's provisions alone. He wants self-governing schools to go further and enter the independent sector, which would require fresh legislation so the clause would not apply to schools opting out of direct state control into another sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot expect me to pick up each red herring that he drags through our proceedings. He has studied the Bill as carefully as any Opposition Member, and he knows that if a school becomes independent, the Bill will no longer apply to it so there is no problem. Independent schools are a red herring in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a red herring, or a blue herring, introduced by the hon. Member for Eastwood in an amendment that he tabled to a previous clause to allow independent schools to receive the same treatment as self-governing schools. I thought that the issue was worth exploring, given the time that the Minister had devoted to the amendment of the hon. Member for Eastwood. The Minister dealt with that debate more constructively than he is doing now. It is important to establish principles. The Minister has made it absolutely clear that a school that is independent now or becomes independent later will not benefit from the Bill. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments which cover a wide range of topics. Although they all have the effect of substituting the word "may" with the word "shall", they cover three clauses and in so doing they raise a number of issues. It may be helpful if I go through them backwards and deal first with the later amendments which raise more technical questions, and then discuss the amendments to clause 44 which raise more central matters of greater principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 301 substitutes the word "may" with the word "shall" in subsection (4) of clause 45. My concern here is one that has been expressed several times in this Committee. Why, in some circumstances, is it thought necessary to introduce the word "may" when the word "shall" might appear to be more appropriate from a reading of the Bill. If we compare "may" in the relevant sentence with the foregoing paragraph—paragraph 4(b)—there seems to be a conflict. Paragraph 4(b) almost makes a judgment; it states that when it appears to the Secretary of State that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is appropriate, on that account"—</p></blockquote>
that is, on the various accounts—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to exclude that land or moveable property of that class or description, from transfer to the authority, he may in an order under the said section…transfer"</p></blockquote>
such property or such land to another person. So the measure states that where it appears to the Secretary of State that it is appropriate to exclude a certain class of property, he may so exclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question naturally arises that if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to exclude such land or property, why would he not exclude it? Why is there an element of discretion there? Because of the way in which paragraph 4(b) is written, it seems to have prejudged the case. If it appears to the Secretary of State that it is appropriate to exclude the property or land, the logic is that he should exclude it. If the word "may" remains, we are leaving the Secretary of State the option of not so excluding. If he does not exclude, he seems to be taking a course of action which, according to the face of the Bill, is not appropriate even in his own eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That oddity of drafting is similar to the oddity which amendment No. 307 points up in clause 47. Subsection 2(b) of that clause provides that where the Secretary of State is satisfied that a set amount of money
	<br><blockquote><p>"ought to be paid, or the investments ought to be transferred",</p></blockquote>
he may require the board of management to pay that money or transfer it. If the Secretary of State believes that money ought to be paid or transferred, why does he need the discretion that the word "may" gives him? If it appears to him that that should be done, he must surely do it and the operative word in that context should be "shall". He should draw the conclusion from his judgment and should not need any discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 301 and 307 deal with the uses of the word "may" when it seems more appropriate to use the word "shall". That follows logically from the previous wording in the Bill. Previous amendments raised similar, but different points
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1179</span>
about the appropriateness of the word "may". After the Minister explains the use of that word, it might turn out to have been inappropriate in those earlier amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 288, 289 and 290 raise a point of principle for the Opposition. We suggest that when a school is being wound up, the property should go to the education authority. The amendments would nullify the provisions of clause 46, which gives the Secretary of State the option of transferring the property that is being wound up to a new and independent school that is not in the education authority's control. Even in the Government's own terms, Opposition Members wonder about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clause 44 state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On closure of a self-governing school it is the responsibility of the education authority to secure adequate provision of education for the pupils concerned."</p></blockquote>
We wonder how the education authority can fulfil the responsibility that the Government say belongs to it without having any of the properties that would enable it to carry out that responsibility. There is a contradiction in saying that, on the closure of a self-governing school, the education authority has the responsibility to secure adequate provision of education for the pupils involved, while potentially denying it the facilities with which it could carry out that responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A tension runs through clauses 44, 45 and 46. The obvious course of action on winding up a school would be for the education authority to take over the responsibility of educating the pupils and so take over also the facilities of the previously self-governing school. That is the gist of those clauses. But at the last moment another option was slipped in which allows the Secretary of State to dispose of the propeties to a new independent school. The two options sit unhappily together, especially in view of what the Government have said about the responsibility of education authorities after the closure of a self-governing school. There does not seem to be much of an option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses say that it is the responsibility of the education authority to make adequate provision of education for the pupils involved after the closure of a self-governing school. The notes on clause 45 state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The normal expectation is that its property should revert back to the education authority."</p></blockquote>
There is an element of tension. The major responsibility is attributed to the education authority, but its option to exercise that responsibility may mean that it has to do so without the necessary facilities. We hope that the Minister will consider that tension and that is why we moved amendments Nos. 288 to 290. Depending on the answers that we receive, we may return to the matter on clause 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 298 and 284 are both technical amendments, but the reasoning behind them may not be clear. Amendment No. 298 amends clause 44(1). From the logic of subsections 1(a) and 1(b), it follows that the Secretary of State shall by order make provision for the winding up of a school. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1180</span>
proposals made by the board of management for the discontinuance of a school are approved by the Secretary of State or if, under clause 31, he has given notice that he intends to withdraw grant, the key decisions will have been taken. Therefore, there will no longer be any scope for discretion in the Secretary of State's actions. The Secretary of State should follow the logic of his decisions. If he has approved the board's proposals or given notice that he will withdraw the grant, he should make provision for the winding up the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those decisions have been taken, one assumes that the Secretary of State has though about them. If so, why is it necessary to give himself room for manoeuvre in the Bill? If he has approved the proposals for the discontinuance of the school, or if he has given notice under section 31, what other option has he but to make provision for winding up of the school? The Minister may have in mind other options which would require the use of the word "may". If so, we wait to hear them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 284 contains no point of principle, although there is scope for discussion of the items in subsection (2). Under the clause, the order of the Secretary of State merely provides for action to be taken or confers powers in relation to winding up. Subsections 2(a) to (k) refer to optional items, so why does there need to be a double option— a double jeopardy? Why does an extra option have to be built into the clause by the word "may"? Some of those items are not optional; they require action. Subsection 2(a) says "stipulate" and subsections (h) and (k) say "require". If action is required, why is it made optional by the use of the word "may" as a prelude to the list? We do not wish to set in stone the requirement in subsection 2(k) because we want to remove it by another amendment, but that is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so much time. It was necessary because the amendments are the same in one sense but have different purposes according to the clauses to which they apply. I hope that the Minister will clarify the technical points made and deal with the main principle. If the education authority has the responsibility to provide education for pupils after a school has been wound up, why has it not been given the facilities to carry out that task?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on the amendments which explore the highways and byways of the use of the term "shall" as opposed to "may" in statutory provisions. Amendment No. 298 seems innocuous, but it would require qualification if it was written into the Bill. It would place the Secretary of State under a duty to make a winding-up order if he had given notice under clause 31 of his intention to cease to maintain a self-governing school. However, under clause 31(8) the Secretary of State may withdraw any such notice that he has given. In those circumstances, he should not be obliged to proceed with a winding-up order, but if amendment No. 298 were accepted without qualification that would be its effect. The Secretary of State must have some leeway on whether to make a winding-up order, consistent with his power under clause 31(8) to withdraw or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1181</span>
vary a notice that he has given of his intention to cease to maintain a school. Hence the use of the term "may" in clause 44(1) is appropriate, whereas "shall" would not be so. The simplest and most appropriate solution is to continue to use the word "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 284 to clause 44(2) would require that any winding-up order would have to contain all the matters listed in paragraphs (a) to (k) of that subsection. However, under clause 44(2) more than one winding-up order could be issued. Indeed, the provision envisages that different orders for different purposes would be required in the course of any winding-up of a self-governing school, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East acknowledged. The final such order would include a provision for the dissolution of the board of management, on the Secretary of State's being satisfied that all the liabilities and other obligations of the board had been discharged in accordance with earlier winding-up orders. The effect of amendment No. 284 would defeat the possibility of different orders, covering differing points, being made in the winding-up procedure. The amendment is, therefore, not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that a winding-up order should be capable of dealing with any, although not necessarily all the matters specified in clause 44(2), amendments Nos. 288, 289 and 290 are also objectionable in that their effect would be that every order under clause 44 would have to provide for the disposal of land or moveable property. Indeed, amendment No. 289 would create an additional problem by requiring that a winding-up order should specify that all land or moveable property of the board of management should transfer to and vest in the education authority. That would contradict the case provided for in clause 46, where the school property was to be transferred to the proposer of a new, independent school. The use of the term "may" in clause 45 gets it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the hon. Gentleman's point about how an education authority would be able to meet the education needs of pupils in the event of the demise of a self-governing school. Hon. Members believe that clause 45(2) leaves it open to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
Secretary of State to dispose of property, which originally belonged to the education authority, to some third party, perhaps for a non-educational purpose, and with no recompense for the education authority, that it is not so. The general effect of the way in which clauses 44 to 46 are drafted is that the Secretary of State may, in a winding-up order, do those things and only those things which the clauses say that he may do. However, if the property had originally been procured at the expense of the education authority, those clauses leave the Secretary of State no option but to order that it be returned to it, with the sole exception of the case covered by clause 46—where someone wishes to acquire it to establish an independent school—and in that case it is specifically required that the education authority should receive value for its property. Obviously if the Secretary of State was persuaded that the buildings were needed by the education authority, he would take that into account before reaching a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 301 and 307 should be resisted. In both cases the Secretary of State has a discretion. The word "may" allows him to do something if he wishes, but the word "shall" would be misleading and imply a duty. The word "shall" is appropriate where there is an objective test which, when met, requires the Secretary of State to take action. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. First, it would not establish the effect that he desires and, secondly, it would introduce bad drafting into the Bill implying a duty that does not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
