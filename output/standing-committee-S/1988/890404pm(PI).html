	<div class='clause'>Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->

	<div class='title'>POWERS AND DUTIES OF BOARD Oh MANAGEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day];</i> No. 39, in page 4, line 30, leave out subsection (3).—	<i>]Mr. McAllion.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have had a break, because I realise, incredible though it is, that the amendment is indeed in the name of the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). I find it difficult to believe the amendment paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides an opportunity for opted-out schools to offer additional education, apart from the statutory requirement to educate children. I have deliberated on the effects, were the amendment accepted. I had a conversation just before the Easter recess with a headmaster of a school in my constituency who proudly told me that his school offered education to adults who wanted to take GCSEs and A-levels—the examinations are different in Scotland— alongside the education provided for schoolchildren.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 would rule out opportunities that we all wish to see extended to adults. Several schools in my area have voluntarily provided adult education, which is given in the classroom at the same time as the schoolchildren are being educated. One 70-year-old is taking an A-level course at Sir John Nelthorpe school in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7(3) would enable an opted-out school to become part of the community. Whether schools are opted-out schools, local authority maintained schools, private schools or public schools, surely we all agree that in any community in the United Kingdom schools should maximise their facilities and opportunities not only for schoolchildren but for the whole community. Of all the provisions, subsection (3) should commend itself to Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Floor of the House the criticism is often made that Governments do not encourage the maximum use of school facilities for adult education. It is said that during school holidays local education authorities do not make available their school premises and other services. Subsection (3) enables an opted-out school to maximise its facilities for the benefit of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
whole community. An opted-out school may wish to take advantage of a particular expertise. For example, a Russian teacher may wish to run a summer school for the local community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Russian?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman laughs, but if he came to a school in my constituency that is run by the local education authority, he would find that the teaching staff voluntarily make their time and services available during school holidays. In clause 7 we are writing into legislation that powers shall be given specifically to an opted-out school to do precisely that. That is a welcome provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members may have intended the amendment to be probing, but that did not come across in the speech of the honourable Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend has not spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. Perhaps the honourable Member for Fife, Central is having second thoughts during my speech. The way in which the amendment was moved suggested to me, if not to my honourable Friends, that it was intended not simply as a probing amendment but as a means of preventing an opted-out school from doing what Opposition Members do not like. They do not want flexibility and freedom for the board of management to do more for the community than simply educating children. But they have frequently said in Committee and elsewhere that a school should be about more than simply educating children, and that has been recognised in the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the honourable Member for Fife, Central will think carefully before supporting the amendment. I hope that he would not dream of pressing it to a Division, as that would mean that the Opposition were against adult education and summer schools, and against schools being part of their communities. I hope that the honourable Member for Fife, Central will tell us what his honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) meant when he moved the amendment this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members have told us that they did not consider that 40 pupils were too many to have in a class. Will they tell us today how many would be too few? The Bill will cause a problem that they do not appear to have noticed. They should have noticed it because some of them have had teaching experience, including experience in further education. They should know—I hope that they will tell their honourable Friends—that below a certain number of pupils a class ceases to be viable. It lacks the interchange of views and stimulation provided by a class of a reasonable size, with pupils interacting with each other and helping each other. For subjects in which discussion is necessary, there must be a reasonable number of pupils. I used to teach, and I know that the hardest task is not teaching 25 or 30 pupils. One of the hardest tasks is to put something into a class with three or four pupils, without the interchanges of a bigger
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
group. Discussion cannot be stimulated so easily. Perhaps unwittingly, the Bill will create the problem that if opted-out schools invite adult students in the community to take part in their classes, the local authority might find it difficult to fill a night class or special adult daytime group on the same subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned not with the convenience of local authorities but with the possibility of their not being able to run certain classes at all. If one or two people have their needs met in their immediate locality, it might mean that there would not be enough people to form a viable class for people drawn from a wider area. The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is smiling—perhaps he will tell us why later. I am talking about the realities of teaching. Often classes cannot be formed because not enough people come forward, and would-be students of certain subjects are disappointed. The problem does not consist simply in the threat of the class being too small to gel together and form an active group of people learning a subject; it concerns financial viability. In my nine years of teaching classes often had to be cancelled because fewer than 10 people applied for them. They may not have been sufficiently popular to attract more than 10 people, but a number of people— perhaps nine—would be disappointed and unable to go to any class because of the lack of financial viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a common problem and that is why local authorities try to organise such classes and publicise them in areas where there is a reasonable catchment so that people have a chance to take them if that is at all possible. That applies particularly to large education areas such as the Glasgow division of Strathclydc regional council. The classes become possible if they are organised and planned, but the Government are proposing that individual schools do whatever comes up their hump and never mind the consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like a camel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Government do not recognise that that failure to plan could mean that some people would not get the classes that they needed and wanted. Conservative Members say that we are opposed to flexibility and freedom. What nonsense. We want people to have the chance to acquire new skills and education, qualifications, but only if they are planned for in a local authority area can we hope to provide the skills, training and qualifications that people want— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), who is muttering, will explain why he opposes what we are saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady, with her usual charm, has let the cat out of the bag. A class is any good only if the director of education and the education authority provide it and force it down. There is no choice; we have it. I am grateful to the honourable Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman cannot have been listening for the past few minutes. My point is that unless classes are planned and organised by somebody—the most relevant person would appear to be the director of education—things will be done in an unplanned fashion with people doing it or not, as they
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
please, in different localities. That will damage the hopes of others who may not be able to attend a class because they live further away and their local school is not offering that further education class. The local authority's further education sector may not be able to find enough people to run a viable class as there is one person here, one person there and one person in some other place and they are all going to individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members cannot understand that, 1 do not know how much more clearly I can explain it. If people are hiving off in ones and twos in different places, it makes it less likely that a viable day-time or night-time class can be formed within the further education sector. That is the case not for the big, popular subjects where hundreds of people always come forward but for the sort of subject—there are hundreds of them—where it can sometimes be difficult to get together a viable class. Although some individuals may be able to go to a local school along with the school pupils for a class, others will not be able to do that. I hope that Conservative Members understand that; if they do not, perhaps they will tell me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), I was rather puzzled when I first saw the amendment on the amendment paper. However, I took the charitable view that it was simply a probing amendment because Opposition Members wished to discuss the issue of adult education. 1 was, initially at least, somewhat taken aback to discover from the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that it was not a probing amendment but a serious proposition by the Labour party. My initial reaction to that was to relate it to the publicity that we have all read about the honourable Member for Dundee, East being one of the leaders of the Scottish—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whatever the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is, it does not appear in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr Hogg. 1 shall not pursue that argument except to say—I hope that my doing so will be in order—that the honourable Member for Dundee, East may have been on the verge of bringing the Committee to a complete halt by his tactic. The Minister was almost speechless—which would have been out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister said that he was stunned, but he never said that he was speechless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Hogg. I am not alleging that the Minister was speechless, but I thought for one moment that he was on the point of being rendered speechless by the honourable Member for Dundee, East and that would have brought the Committee to a grinding halt, doubtless as part of a wider plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take the amendment seriously because the honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
Fyfe) tried to justify it. Her view is based on the premise that there will be many opted-out schools. Her argument falls if only a few schools opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will not be hundreds of opted-out schools in Scotland because the Scottish people do not like the idea. Conservative Members are irresponsibly going ahead with legislation that could create problems. They should not fashion the law in that way. I am not sure whether they foresaw those problems and decided that they did not matter, or whether they failed to see them. But they should deal with the matter and give us an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to do so, but my comment stands. The honourable Lady bases her argument on the assumption that a substantial number of schools will opt out. She argues that if opted-out schools throughout urban areas set up adult education classes, numbers in the further education sector may fall and classes may no longer be viable—that is theoretically possible, but it is fairly obscure. The counterargument is that if a class is available in a self-governing school, people should be encouraged to take up those places. So it is not a real problem. But even if that were a theoretical problem, it is astonishing for the honourable Lady to propose that because an occasional class in the further education sector might be undersubscribed if many schools opt out, we should ban all opted-out schools from putting on any adult education classes whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not a probing amendment; it is a serious amendment. Is it the Labour party's policy that self-governing schools should not serve the community through adult education? If so, let the people of Scotland hear it loud and clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) would listen to what I am saying. I pointed out that the viability of some classes may be barely reached—they may have only 10,11 or 12 students—so it may take only one or two students moving to a more local school that had opted out to destroy the viability of the more centrally run class. The honourable Member for Eastwood said that that does not present a problem as people can attend those classes in self-governing schools, but with centrally organised and planned education, those facilities can be made more widely available to a greater number of people. Instead of a hotchpotch, careless system, classes could be planned so that they are viable for Drumchapel and Easterhouse. The honourable Member for Eastwood seems to be saying that if a class is not available in Drumchapel, people should go to Eastwood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask honourable Members to make brief interventions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Lady for the hypothesis on which her argument is based—that schools in Drumchapel and Easterhouse will opt out. That is a positive development in Labour party policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, even if there is a theoretical problem, to say that self-governing schools should not be allowed to use existing facilities and expertise for the benefit of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
community seems to be the height of absurdity. It reflects the Labour party's view on so many issues, that uniformity and planning are paramount and that if something is not planned by an authority, problems are bound to arise. Labour Members never want diversity or the choice to which my honourable Friend the Minster refers. That is the assumption behind this extraordinary proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been criticised for disagreeing with certain aspects of Strathclyde regional council's policies, but I pay tribute to its adult education policies. It has been in the lead in Scotland in bringing adults into school education. My honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was right to point out the need to use opted-out schools' resources and specialist skills effectively. 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> of 26 March carried an article about Moslems planning a schools takeover, which suggests that the Islamic community has an interest in taking part in self-governing schools. Its expertise in organising courses on Islamic studies, for example, may be of wide interest to the community as a whole. That is just an example of the general theme to which my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to see whether the Opposition push the amendment to a vote. It seems reasonable to use an amendment to probe these matters, but to believe, because of an obsession with uniformity and planning, that resources available for education should not be made available to the community is the height of absurdity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nair and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess to being somewhat puzzled, first by the Bill and secondly by the amendment. That makes my puzzlement fairly comprehensive. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Unfortunately, I have not had the same benefit of adult education as the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are discussing whether evening classes should be run in an opted-out school—classes on subjects such as needlework, music or the life cycle of the ant—I do not understand why it is necessary to give the school power to allow such classes to be held. I thought that a school had that power anyway. If I set up a private school in Stirling to teach liberal philosophy and the Minister wisely decided to attend at weekends and to pay me a suitable sum, there is nothing in the law to prevent that. I should be worried if there were. Private classes in almost any subject can be offered at any time by any person or persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However if the subsection is necessary, why should we delete it? I have read the brief produced by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I confess that I found it somewhat dense. By that I mean that the argument was so thick, I was unable to follow it. That might have been my fault. Its argument is directed at clause 7(3) and it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that a school can opt-out will create problems to the education authority in relation to its current duties and to its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
obligations to the pupils in the area of the school."</p></blockquote>
I agre with that. It is part of the general argument against the Bill, but it has little to do with the subsection. The brief continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority could also be faced with an organisation which has the ability to provide other forms of education which must presumably include what is now defined as Further Education or Community Education in competition."</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly long sentence, but we get the general drift. However, I do not understand why that is different from what is already possible. As I said, people can set up schools to teach anybody about anything and as far as I am aware there is no law against that. As they say, "What's new pussycat?" I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last sentence of the brief states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The education authority will still have an obligation to provide these facilities in the area of an opted-out school and logical planning would seem to be impossible."</p></blockquote>
With respect to COSLA, that is rubbish. In reality, little logical planning is possible in some areas of further education. It is dependent on demand and whether enough people wish to attend a class to justify it as a viable proposition. It also depends on whether there are enough teachers and whether there is enough money from the Government or local authorities to make it possible. I do not understand that argument from COSLA, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) made the only argument that was worth considering. She said that such classes might affect the viability of other classes that were being run by the authority in the area. Competition would mean that other classes would have to be abandoned because they would no longer be viable. It is a logical argument, but I doubt whether it is realistic. I do not approve of opted-out schools, but one must presume that people will act logically. I do not understand why an opted-out school would lay on classes and charge for them when the number of people going to such classes in the area is already small. I do not see how the danger that the honourable Lady fears would occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the honourable Gentleman genuinely seeks information and that he will listen to my explanation. A school providing subjects at the senior level may have space for a few adults to join their classes during the daytime, whether for French, German, history or whatever. If people took up that option in their own locality it might mean that similar local authority classes, perhaps in the city centre if Glasgow is taken as an example, would no longer be viable because individuals here and there took classes more locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, services should be run as locally as possible but some classes will attract only a few people so they must be held somewhere that is easily accessible. A class in ancient Greek philosophy should be held not in a peripheral part of Glasgow but in the city
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
centre. It would need only one or two people to opt out and go to a local school for a class to cease to be viable. I am sorry for the length of my intervention, Mr. Hogg. I hope that you understand the point that I am trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. You might be interested to know that I have been trying to learn German. There arc many ways to learn it and I could speak about them for some time if I were so minded, but I do not believe in long-windedness. I could have learnt with Linguaphone, the Reader's Digest and the BBC, who were all keen to send me cassettes for a suitable sum of money. There are already a great many people and agencies in the market place offering that service. I doubt whether it will make any difference if one or two schools with the capacity to let rooms for that purpose decide to opt out. I shall conclude as I am aware of your concern for time, Mr. Hogg. I am not making an intervention but speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To sum up, I wish to ask the Minister why the subsection is necessary. The only argument for deleting it is that it is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michaelm Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For members of the Liberal party life is one puzzle after another. They arc beset by waves of indecision and uncertainty. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R Johnston) is known as a reasonable, well-intentioned, kindly man who is disposed to sec the best side of everything and everyone. That explains his puzzlement. When I first read the subsection I was puzzled as to why it had been included. I was also puzzled by the amendment. My puzzlement continued, but not for as long as that of the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber. It ended during the speech of the honourable Member for Glasgow, Mary-hill (Mrs. Fyfe) about the need for a centrally organised education. When she stressed how dangerous it would be for adult education classes to take place on the premises of self-governing schools, I began to sec the dangers, my puzzlement stopped and I understood the need for the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With every hour that the Committee sits, it is becoming clearer that the Bill, and the self-governing schools that it will introduce, has many dedicated enemies who are determined to frustrate those schools and freeze them out of the main education system. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber should not be puzzled. It is necessary to have an assertive and positive subsection in the clause, determining the right of self-governing schools to hold activities such as adult education classes on their premises. That is why the subsection is necessary and why the amendment must be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are puzzled not by the amendment but by the subsection. I understood the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) to say that he was puzzled when he first read the subsection. That in itself justifies tabling a probing amendment to try to discover what the Government's intentions are. For the amendment to remain probing, the Government must give a genuine response to the questions that we are trying to raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman absolutely correct. It is normal in Standing Committee proceedings to table a probing amendment and for its mover to reserve judgment until the Minister has responded. But that did not happen with this amendment. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asserted that the amendment aimed not to probe but to delete the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it surprising that the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) can assert what I said as he could not even remember that I had moved the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the history of the previous amendment, I should understand perfectly if my honourable Friend had said what Conservative Members believed him to have said. After reflecting on the inadequacy of the Government's response, we felt that we had to press the previous amendment to a Division. When we fail to get a realistic response from the Government to one of our amendments, we might have to express our dissatisfaction by pressing it to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eagerness with which the Government grasped the red herring of whether the amendment was probing is indicative of their desire to avoid the real meaning of the subsection and to start banging on about Socialist centralism. No such sentiment has come from Opposition Members. We simply want to know the point of the subsection. Will it interfere with the ability of the education authorities to provide further education classes?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a good question. Conservative Members seem to be arguing that without the subsection, self-governing schools would be unable to provide the sort of classes that were referred to by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Locha-ber (Sir R Johnston). If it were not in their power to do so without the clause, that would be a reasonable argument for including it. I am astonished that we have had to wait all this time for the first genuine argument in its favour. We have been trying to elicit such an argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. We have yet to have a clause stand part debate on clause 7. We are debating whether subsection (3) should be removed from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. The amendment is in order. Our purpose in tabling it was to find out the Government's reasoning. The Opposition worry about the potential for the introduction of such classes to disrupt education authorities' ability to provide similar classes is reasonable. I am puzzled about the status and financing of such a provision that might be offered by a self-governing school. I wonder
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>
whether the subsection is designed to enable a self-governing school to use moneys from the Secretary of State to provide that sort of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would make it different from the examples that were cited by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber where organisations offer classes in various subjects and charge full fees for doing so. There is nothing to prevent them from doing that. Is the subsection intended to go a wee bit further and enable self-governing schools to provide courses, not as self-financing schools to provide courses, but in such a way as to make it legitimate for them to employ Government finance? If that is the case, it gives us cause for real concern, as it will be hard to prevent self-governing schools acting in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend has made an important point that I had intended to put to the Minister but he could have taken the argument a little further. If charges are made for parents to attend a school, could they be entered on its roll? If so, by August next year some people could be denied access because parents were on the roll of the school for whom charges were made because money had to be found to pay techers to instruct their pupils, be they adults or children. That aspect has grave cost implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another danger. The honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) suggested, quite reasonably, that the clause might be designed to prevent a self-governing school from acting ultra vires by attempting to behave in the same way as other private organisations. I wonder whether the subsection is intended to allow the Government to provide finance for that sort of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the honourable Gentleman said, and I must confess that I had not thought of that aspect. Clearly, it would put a different complexion on matters. I could be wrong, but I should have thought that the clause would have had to be longer and more specific if it were intended, as the honourable Gentleman suggests, to allow an opted-out school to share in the subsidising of evening classes, which is provided as a matter of course to a regional authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could be so, but we shall have to wait to hear what the Minister has to say before we can discover whether it is true. If that is the case, all the worries that Opposition Members have voiced are entirely reasonable. Certainly, the local education authority in my area tries to provide as much further education as it can, but the viability of some of its classes is threatened by the paucity of the numbers attending them. If some of those pupils are to be diverted to other classes or similar subjects, which are financed out of Government funds, I wonder what will happen to the remainder who are not so diverted but still wish to receive further education from the local education authority. What will be the position of
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
those whose classes will no longer be viable? Will they be left without classes or will they have a right to access to others offered by the self-governing schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members talk about access, but if a self-governing school using Government finance sets up a further education class that makes the education authority class no longer viable, will those expected to take the education authority class be entitled to access to the class at the self-governing school? Our concern is that such further education opportunities should still be available, and that access should not be denied, but if the numbers are so few for some classes that only one such provision can reasonably be made within a locality and the education authority's ability to make that provision is disrupted by a self-governing school channelling away prospective students, what recourse will the remaining pupils have? That is an important point, but we have heard no argument whatever from Conservative Members. Instead, we have had gleeful Aunt Sallys, and apart from the ultra vires point made by the honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, no attempt has been made to explain the reasoning behind the subsection. I hope that the Minister can enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we all wish to hear the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Puzzlement" appears to have become the key word in this debate. Perhaps that is because it is sometimes difficult to undersand provisions. We arc looking through a glass darkly and trying desperately to understand the thinking behind the provisions. The only explanation on subsection (3) given in the Scottish Office briefing is that it would enable the provision of adult education at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sounds fine; no one objects to the concept that an opted-out school should continue to provide adult education, but amendment No. 39 should be regarded as a probing amendment as several organisations have told me that they wish to understand the reason behind the provision. For example, the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does it allow a Board of Management to set up a private FE College or nursery school in competition with the state provision? If not, what kind of education is envisaged?"</p></blockquote>
Organisations want a further explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed with interest the arguments made by the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) about finance. I look at the matter from a slightly different angle. Clause 11(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The board of management of a self-governing school may make charges in respect of some or all of … the provision of school education."</p></blockquote>
The Minister made it clear at an earlier sitting that school education is that defined by the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. We are all relieved to find that no alteration has been made to that. My fear is that a board of management may see the provision as an opportunity to provide only courses that are extremely popular. People with minority interests may be denied access to adult education in their own commu-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
nities. The fear of such inequality worries Opposition Members and we should like further clarification before deciding whether to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COSLA briefing referred to the use of the word "planning". That is a trigger for Conservative Members. They are Pavlovian in their reactions because to them planning signifies something unacceptable. Perhaps planning should be looked at differently. We are looking for a coherent strategy for adult education in Scotland. Adult education is a vital part of our education system and it would be wrong if pockets of inequality and lack of opportunity built up as a result of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have made much play of their commitment to adult education. That would carry more conviction if the Government had shown more commitment to Newbattle Abbey, our only residential college for adults. That is a straight political point. Over the years the Alexander report has been allowed to gather dust, and it has not been fully implemented. The present Government and the previous Administration of a different colour must share the guilt for failing to implement that report, which was one of the most exciting and dyamic education reports ever produced. It is a condemnation of Governments of both parties that they have failed to implement it in full. Will the Minister tell us exactly what he has in mind concerning the power to provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"education other than school education at the school",</p></blockquote>
and how he envisages that people will have equal opportunities irrespective of where they come from? Adult education must play a full part, and I should not like any opted-out school to be denied the opportunity to provide it, but I want to know how it will be funded. Will it be supported through charges or central funding? We must know the answers before we decide on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall develop some ideas that have already been raised, especially by my honourable Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). It would be too dangerous to leave the subsection saying simply,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the board of management … shall … have power to provide education other than school education at the school."</p></blockquote>
It needs definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adults can already come into classes in schools in Scotland if there is room in the class. If there were no room that would have staffing implications and adults could not be accepted. Which classes would be open to adults would depend on the school curriculum. Some schools might need extra staff for the adults, if the entitlement for the year were 1.6 members of staff for the number of adults. For staffing purposes an adult in ' school for a certain time equals a certain percentage of a pupil—say, 0.5 per cent. There are implications for staffing and finance. The viability of classes is important, and it varies from subject to subject. For English or mathematics 33 is a viable class size, whereas for chemistry, biology and other sciences the number is 20. I have had experience of adults asking whether they can enter an O-grade chemistry or biology class and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
school having to consider staffing levels by looking at the S3 curriculum to find out how many pupils were provided for the year before. If we had provided for, say 18, there would be two places left for adults, but if we had already provided for 20 no adults would be able to study chemistry or biology at the school. Adult education would not be viable there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation has implications for self-governing schools. Such a school could decide to attract adults to chemistry and biology classes and under the Bill it could say to the Secretary of State that it wanted several sections that included adults. The Secretary of State could then allow extra finance for a self-governing school that is not now allowed for local authority schools. That would be a distortion of the curriculum available to particular communities because of the link between a self-governing school making certain provisions in a curriculum and the Secretary of State accepting them. That is why we are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier the admissions policy of schools in Glasgow some years ago. A parent took Holyrood secondary school to court because his child was not given access to that school. My recollection is hazy, but I remember that the authorities argued that the school had 1,500 pupils so was full up. The sherrif ruled that the school was not full up because another one pupil would make no difference. It was suggested that that child was an S3 pupil and the S3 sections were full up. An extra pupil in a school of 1,500 makes a tremendous difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when we see the fine detail we accept that the clause should contain definitions. It is dangerous to allow the clause to go through without further examination. The provision that the Secretary of State has in mind for self-governing schools is crucial to the education authority as a planning authority and to schools and further education colleges. The concept of education that has been promoted, especially in Strathclyde, in the past few years has had a community dimension. The school is not seen as an island but as a part of the community. Without further definition, not only will adult education be undermined, but other forms of education, even nursery school provision. The Minister should give us a further explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has generated more heat than light. I shall generate even more heat. I was grateful to my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) for the revelation that an adult education class would be non-viable if it had 10 or fewer members. It is an interesting thought that if all the Conservative Scottish Members came together, they would not justify expenditure by an education authority on a part-time teacher, yet they believe that they have the right to rule Scotland. It is a strange business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to learn that my contributions to the debate have left the Minister variously stunned or speechless. In the previous Committee on which I served with you, Mr. Hogg, the Minister was continually saying that I took his breath away. Some in Scotland wish that I had done so permanently. Failing that, we shall continue the debate.

The contributions of Conservative Members were disappointing because they did not deal with the Opposition's arguments. Instead, they ignored what we said and conducted a desperate debate using their fevered imaginations. The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) said that the amendment meant that school teachers would no longer be able to take classes outwith normal school times, that there would be no summer schools, and that there would be an end to voluntarism in self-governing schools. No Opposition Member suggested any such thing. That idea came from the honourable Gentleman's fevered brow and from nowhere else. I made it clear that if the sort of adult education provided in state-maintained schools at present was the only education other than school education available in self-governing schools, we should be prepared to consider the matter with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know the relationship between those responsible for the strategic planning of further education and community education in any education authority area, and those charged at local level with the responsibility of implementing that strategic plan. We must ask questions about the extent to which self-governing schools will be allowed to provide non-school education and whether restraints should be imposed on them, especially for further education and community education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Fyfe) raised a good point about further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Division, I was saying that the amendment deals with the key question of the relationship between those responsible for the strategic planning of further and community education in an education authority area and those who are charged with the responsibility of implementing that plan at local level. The honourable Member for Moray made the good point that there is a danger, because of subsection (3), that a self-governing school could set up a further education college in competition to those in the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that sense, a self-governing school could disrupt the strategic plan of the education authority for the provision of further education in its area. The Minister must deal with the Bill's potential to cause that type of disruption and tell us how he sees self-governing schools submitting to the overall strategic control of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, strategic control of the provision of further and community eduction is placed firmly with the education authority and with no one else. Circular 929, which was issued in April 1975, deals with section 125 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, wherein it is stated that it is the duty of education authorities to appoint college councils to discharge functions of management and supervision of education, subject to directions given by the education authority and
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the authority shall determine."</p></blockquote>
Under the existing legislation, education authorities can delegate some functions to college councils, but overall control remains clearly with the education authority. That is spelt out in the guidance contained in circular 929. In dealing with the representation for education authorities on college councils, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In fixing the number of education committee representatives authorities should take account of the functions being delegated to the college council. The greater degree of delegation … the greater should be the number of education committee representatives to be appointed."</p></blockquote>
That shows the direct relationship between the functions carried out by further education colleges and the responsibility for them, which is placed clearly and exclusively with the education authority. The guidance also deals with the functions themselves. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority, in consultation with the college council, should be responsible for determining the general education character of the college and its place in the authority's educational system."</p></blockquote>
That is the key phrase with which the Minister must deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has a system for the provision of further and community education. The Minister must spell out where self-governing schools will be placed in that overall system and what their relationship will be with existing further education colleges. The guidance adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The functions of college councils should therefore be clearly defined and the councils should be entrusted with the maximum powers consistent with the education authority's ultimate responsibility."</p></blockquote>
That is clear, and as I understand it the Minister is yet to repudiate the sentiments of circular 929. In fact the opposite is the case. The Government endorse the circular's general approach They seek to change it in other ways, but not to change its basic premise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1981 the Council for Tertiary Education in Scotland produced a report reviewing the structure and management of tertiary education in Scotland. It included "desirable characteristics" of the system, one of which was that the system should be able to meet changing needs by allocating or reallocating resources in the most efficient way in co-operation with universities, secondary education and the providers of training. It clearly recognised the need for an integrated, comprehensive approach to the provision of further and community education in Scotland. It spelt it out even more clearly by stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The system must be effective in deploying its resources in line with the needs which arc given preference. When resources are limited"—</p></blockquote>
even the Minister must admit that resources for Scottish education have been limited for many years—
	<br><blockquote><p>"additional provision to meet new or growing needs must be balanced by a continual re-appraisal of the provision for needs whose relative importance is declining, leading to the switching of resources from the latter to the former with the minimum of delay. Co-ordination with universities and secondary education is needed to ensure that each need is met in the system best suited to provide for it, to share resources where possible and to avoid unnecessary duplication. For many vocations, tertiary education and practical training together form an integrated preparation which requires to be planned by the education and training systems together."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
The operative word is "planned". The Minister has not yet explained how such planning could occur if self-governing schools were allowed a free hand to indulge in further and community education, irrespective of what the education authority might be attempting to do locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, in the most recent consultation document, which the Minister has authorised to be sent out, on proposals to improve the management of further education colleges in Scotland, the Minister endorses all of the previous documents. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government believes that the diagnosis of 1973"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973—
	<br><blockquote><p>"1975 and 1981 is as valid now as it was then."</p></blockquote>
The document spells it out for all to understand:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the Council for Tertiary Education suggested, the objective should then be that once a college's budget has been determined the college council would then have maximum scope to deploy resources as it sees fit to achieve its objectives, within the education authority's strategic plan for further education in the area."</p></blockquote>
These are not my words but those of the consultation document issued by the Minister.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Within the education authority's strategic plan for further education in the area."</p></blockquote>
Where do self-governing schools stand within an education authority's strategic plan? How would subsection (3) affect the rights of self-governing schools to set up further education colleges or anything else in competition with the education authority's strategic plan. The Minister has not dealt with those questions. Many red herrings have been raised about self-governing schools not being the same as state schools and teachers not being allowed to give their time voluntarily to take summer schools or evening classes in knitting. That has been the level of the debate so far, but we are alarmed about serious matters such as YTS training and apprenticeships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for everyone's convenience if I suggest that we have our break for dinner from 7.30pm to 9.30pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely civilised of you, Mr. Hogg, and I am sure that the Committee is grateful for that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will deal seriously with the amendment, because it does not just involve basket-weaving, knitting, or other extracurricular activities that will take place in self-governing schools in the evenings on a voluntary basis with part-time teachers. It involves the wide powers given to self-governing schools under subsection (3) to provide education
	<br><blockquote><p>"other than school education at the school".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
The Minister must be specific about what other education self-governing schools can participate in. Will they be able to provide places in the youth training scheme, to provide places under Employment Training, to provide apprenticeship training, to set up alternative further education colleges to those that are run by the education authority and, if so, how will they be brought within the overall pattern established by the education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-governing schools might have a part to play in such provision, but that would have to fit in with the existing pattern of overall provision made available by the education authority. It would also have to fit in with the priorities set down by national and local agencies, including the education authorities and the local training boards, which will be established by Scottish Enterprise. In my area, for example, the Dundee Project brings together trade unions, business and local authorities and tries to provide an integrated approach to economic development, which I am sure that the Minister applauds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That integrated approach can continue only if bodies such as self-governing schools are made to fit in with the overall pattern and are not allowed to act as mavericks and pursue whatever is popular or profitable for them. The Minister seems shocked by my saying that, but it is important. Although more money might be made from diverting scarce resources into providing knitting or basket-weaving courses, that might not suit the local area. Priorities established through local training bodies, through local projects such as the Dundee Project, through consultation with education authorities, through a desire to develop the local economy, meet local training needs and direct them towards good long-term employment, should be adhered to by everyone involved in local training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have not even given a thought to those issues, but merely wish to give self-governing schools a free hand to provide whatever education outwith school education they see fit to provide in the interests of the self-governing school and not of those living in the area. I am interested to learn how wide the remit will be for self-governing schools to become involved in such courses and how those courses will be integrated with other courses made available through the bodies that the Government have established to try to develop the local economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a scandal for the Minister to allow self-governing schools to rampage like bulls in a china shop through local training provisions, directing resources away from priority areas and back into areas which may suit the leisure needs of some local people but which do not suit the economic needs of the vast majority of people. That is an important argument and I hope that the Minister will explain his thinking. So far, he has failed to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

he is naturally provocative, honourable Members may wish to intervene during his speech to probe his remarks further. It is evident, Mr. Hogg, that you are concerned about the length of interventions. Clearly, you have no wish to be arbitrary in exercising your authority. Consequently, it would greatly assist the Committee if you could say how long "long" is. If it is difficult for you to define that, perhaps we could adjourn to discuss it further informally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will not be necessary. An intervention should be roughly half the length of the honourable Gentleman's point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has set a new standard by which we are to judge further education- courses. He said that knitting can be bad for people and that organising knitting courses can be bad for communities. He has opined that popular courses that involve leisure pursuits are not good for people, and has argued that there are more serious subjects. His solution, as my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) pointed out, is to remove the ability of self-governing schools to organise courses of any kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the puzzlement of the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R Johnston), but was puzzled by his contribution because he kept referring to the COSLA briefing. Only after I had heard speeches by other Opposition Members did it dawn on me that COSLA is briefing only one side of the Committee. People can draw their own conclusions about COSLA's independence and ability to represent all the local authorities in Scotland. I have not been privy to the briefing to which the honourable Gentleman referred, but I agree with his analysis of it—it makes no sense. However, the amendment is predictable as it seeks to retain the local authority monopoly of the provision of further education courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood in his congratulations to Strathelyde regional council on its efforts to bring adults into schools and on the progress that it has made in adult education. But a confident local authority system would not fear competition or the end of its monopoly. If Opposition Members were sincere in their belief that no schools will become self-governing and that existing provisions are ideal and reflect the needs and wishes of communities, they would not need to table protective admendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To his credit, the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) did not add his name to the amendment or speak in the same terms as other Opposition Members. He said that it was simply a probing amendment. From what we have heard, the COSLA briefing is more than probing and the amendment is protectionist. The honourable Member for Western Isles was right to distance himself from that. He asked why subsection (3) was necessary and my honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) answered that fully when he said that there must be no doubt that self-governing schools have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Gains-
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
borough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) asked the honourable Member for Western Isles whether, if a self-governing school provided further education courses that interfered with the local authority, he would be opposed to action through the courts to test the school's ability to deliver those services if subsection (3) were not included? The honourable Member for Western Isles did not answer that question. It was answered by my honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the debate, it has been apparent that the Opposition do not wish self-governing schools to be able to provide further education, whether leisure or academically related, which is in competition to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I recall, my honourable Friend and Member for Western isles (Mr. Macdonald) replied to that question, which the 	<i>Hansard</i> record will show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment was tabled so that we would receive an answer to a simple question. What will happen if a local authority provision is no longer viable because there are not enough takers for a class in which there may be only a small amount of interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unnecessary for the honourable Lady to repeat her speech in an intervention. She referred to that many times during the debate and I shall respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand the Minister to be saying that the only reason why the subsection is included in the Bill is to make it clear that that power exists, so that there will be no doubt about it? Who raised the doubt? Has the Minister had legal advice on the necessity to include it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on to deal with the honourable Gentleman's argument as he crystallised it during his speech. My honourable Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that if it were not clear that the self-governing school had the power to provide non-school education, it would be open to challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) said that there were all sorts of providers of private education and that he was learning German and had considered several possibilities. Perhaps I shall have a word with him later about that on a personal basis. It seemed that he did not make the distinction between self-governign schools and the private providers that exist across a range of subjects. Those schools are financed with public money, so it is important that the money is spent within the statutory powers and authority of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If subsection (3) were not included in the Bill, I am advised that were a school to provide those courses, it could be open to challenge. Listening to the Opposition in Committee and to the snippets of COSLA briefing, it is perfectly apparent that many people would wish to make such a challenge, if only to preserve the local authority monopoly. That is why subsection (3) is included and why the honourable Member for Dundee, East has spoken to an amendment that is not a probing one, but one designed to maintain the local authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
monopoly, regardless of the consequences to the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard an ingenious argument from the honourable Member for Maryhill, who said that if those self-governing schools were successful, they might run courses in the peripheral areas, which would not make sense because the best place to organise such matters would be in the city centre, so the proposal would disrupt courses and make planning impossible. I maybe doing the honourable Lady a disservice, but she appeared to be telling the Committee that self-governing schools might offer courses that people would want to attend, market them in such a way that people would be attracted to them and run them in areas of the city that were convenient for people Clearly, that would be shocking as it would go against every feature of local government planning, so it must be stopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few of the honourable Lady's constituents are likely to be sympathetic to that argument and I believe that they would welcome diversity. They will be sad to see their Member of Parliament associating herself with arguments of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stand against her at the next election and see what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the honourable Lady is highly respected and deservedly so, and that this is a slip from the standards that she usually sets herself. But I am afraid that her argument that the running of courses that arc attractive to her constituents will upset local authority planning is wide of the mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) asked about charging and said that she was very worried about inequality. I hope that if the amendment is pressed she will not support it as the inequality that concerns me is that which it seeks to introduce: that an organisation that fails to run something which the local authority believes is appropriate will receive nothing. To suggest that inequality will be introduced because it will be possible for charges to be made, as is the case in local authority schools, is a most puzzling line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of diversion, the honourable Lady said that she would be more convinced of our commitment to adult education were it not for the fact that the Newbattle Abbey residential college was being closed. However, if that college had received the support which it claimed it would get in funding from the local authorities and trade unions, we would have been more convinced about their commitment to its adult education residential courses. I believe that the sum of the promises made amounted to£30,000. Local authorities recognise that the proper place to provide adult education is locally and they have worked in partnership with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting thread in the debate has been the Opposition's clear belief that the schools are to be kept apart from local authority schools. It will be apparent to those who believe in planning that it will be possible for self-governing schools to act as agents for local authorities and to run courses as part of the local authorities'
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
programmes. We would want to encourage that, but if they incurred expenditure on their own behalf in so doing they would be in some difficulty without subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment should be rejected as it is an attack on the principles to which we are committed to extend opportunities for continuing education, especially in view of the demographic decline that we face. The thrust of our policy is to encourage people to come back into education, especially those who may have missed opportunities the first time round, and self-governing schools have an important part to play in that regard, as do the local authorities and the private providers of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm whether self-governing schools will be able to use Government funds to provide the sort of courses mentioned in subsection (3)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the honourable Gentleman was not present when I made the first part of my speech, but if he had been he would know that the answer to his question is yes. Self-governing schools will be able to organise courses of non-school education according to what they think is appropriate for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the astonishment of my honourable Friend the Member for Hexham at the amendment. I, too, thought that it was a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Minister did not answer directly the point made by the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). If a self-governing school establishes a further education class, will it be able to obtain the same Government subsidy that the regional authority would get for making the same provision in the regional council area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the self-governing school comes to an arrangement with the education authority, the authority will be able to provide funding for that purpose. The funding from central Government will be commensurate with the funding that would be received for the provision of school education if the school were in the education authority sector. Funds will be deployed on that basis. Equally, the self-governing school could make its courses self-financing through charges or, for some courses, it could get funding from the private sector or from central Government. It will be open to the self-governing school to do that if it wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Adults planning to come back to school do not plan a year ahead. Furthermore, their numbers vary. If a self-governing school asks for funds because it is taking on another English teacher as a certain number of adults want to enrol for a course, what financial arrangement will prevail between the Secretary of State and the school? The Secretary of State will give the self-governing school money, but will that finance be separate from the normal school education? Will the Scottish Office give the school money soley for adult education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had answered that question. The answer is that there will not be a specific allocation unless the self-governing school is involved in a specific project for which it would be appropriate to provide funding. In the normal course of events, funds for whatever out-of-school courses a school cares to provide will come from the overall grant that will take account of the funding that it could have expected to receive had it remained within the education authority system. Self-governing schools will be able to add to their funding by fees or through additional funding from elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seemed to say that a self-governing school could use money received directly from central Government to fund classes other than school education. If I have misunderstood him, will he confirm that a self-governing school using money received directly from central Government, for whatever purpose, as part of its allocation will not be permitted to use that money for education other than school education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the school thought it appropriate to use central Government funding for particular courses or training schemes, that the Government wished to encourage that would be a matter for the board of management. The board of management will have a duty to promote the wider community use of the school's facilities and the provision of further education courses is an obvious response to that duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister further. In his response to me, he mentioned the money received for specific projects that the Government wish to encourage. For example, there may be 25 individuals like the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir. R Johnston), in the heyday of their lives, who would like to take up German, so they go along to a school. Would that qualify as a special project? If it does, there is extra money available, and that is why I am pressing the Minister on exactly what money is available and how it will be used. Would the example given by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber be considered to be a specific project?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) would always qualify as a special project, but my answer to the general question that is being asked, is that I think that such a course would not qualify. The funding that will be provided is for school education and will be provided on the basis of what the school could have expected to receive were it part of the local authority system. If the honourable Gentleman is making out a case for special funding to be provided for self-governing schools so that they can run such courses, I am happy to listen to that case. If he is pursuing that line of argument, I hope that he will not vote for this very stupid amendment, which would prevent self-governing schools from running courses of any kind, whether self-financing or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause states that the school will
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide education other than school education".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has spoken of specific projects and I am asking whether certain money is available under the heading of specific projects or
	<br><blockquote><p>"education other than school education".</p></blockquote>
That is in the Bill, and that is why I am asking the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seem to be achieving a communication link with the honourable Gentleman. The schools in Strathclyde that are taking in adults to study for highers, standard grade and so on are funding that out of the provision that is made for education in Strathclyde, as it is for other education authorities. The self-governing schools will be provided with funding on the same basis. If they wish to run additional courses, of whatever kind, they are free to do so. Their power to do so is enshrined in the subsection that the honourable Gentleman and his Friends wish to see deleted. The freedom to provide those courses is there for self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to funding them, the self-governing schools could provide funding from the grants that are available to them, obtain sponsorship from the private sector or introduce fees in the way that many local authority schools do for courses, particularly those outside school hours—which I was delighted to hear the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber call evening classes. The choice is open to the self-governing school and to the board of management. The amendment would prevent them from competing with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the amendment was given to Opposition Members by COSLA, but it is a real cheek for them to put the amendment to the Committee, having gone around Scotland telling people that the self-governing schools would no longer be part of their community and provide services to it. That is extraordinary, and I can only assume that the amendment has been tabled and is being supported to ring into reality the predictions that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our concern is to ensure that community education is as widely available as possible within a locality's resources to provide for education. The Minister has conceded that self-governing schools would be able to use funds received directly from central Government to finance
	<br><blockquote><p>"education other than school education".</p></blockquote>
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in doing that in a specific class—for example, French—it renders a local authority class inviable because some people attend a self-governing school's course instead, what provision will be made for the remainder of the people who would have enjoyed the education authority course? Will the self-governing school be required to accept them and provide for the same number as the local authority had intended to do until it became inviable to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have already dealt with all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
those arguments, but I shall do so again for the honourable Gentleman's benefit. When he spoke about support for courses, I was not sure whether he was talking about people attending classes with children or after-hours classes. He appeared to argue that some classes would draw people from the local authority pool and make it more difficult for the local authority to operate its existing classes. If so, it would be because classes run by self-governing schools were more attractive. That presupposes that there is a finite pool of people upon which the schools are drawing, but that is not so. It might be possible to add to the number of participants by changing the times of classes or marketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education authority uses resources provided for education, often for adults who go to the school and for which the actual cost is very low and the benefit to the community very great. That also applies to self-governing schools. When the honourable Member for Western Isles was out of the Committee, I distanced him from the position of his colleagues, which is reflected in the fact that he has not added his name to the amendment. He has pursued a different and perfectly respectable line of argument from that of his colleagues and I take his commitment to adult education at face value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for the amendment is that the clause will interfere with the education authority's ability to plan. We believe that the education system should meet the interests of parents and the wider community, not those of the planners and the educationists. That division will be apparent when we discuss later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the honourable Member for Western Isles interrupted me, I was saying that self-governing schools had been portrayed as schools that would no longer be of the community and would no longer offer services to the community. The Opposition have tabled an amendment that seeks to deny them the opportunity to provide those services because they believe that only local authorities are capable of delivering them. That is as absurd as the Government saying that education authorities are unable to provide schools and adult education courses of a standard as high as that in self-governing schools. I hope that the honourable Member for Dundee, East will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. During the debate, the Minister said that one honourable Member's name did not appear on the amendment paper. It is usual for only six names to appear and it is possible that the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) signed the amendment, but additional names after six do not appear on the amendment paper. Whether or not the honourable Member signed remains one of life's mysteries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that that matter has been clarified. The Minister is isolated from the humdrum life of tabling amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) could tell us whether he signed the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) is correct, but we must bear it in mind that the honourable Member for Western Isles is a Highlander, and by nature they are mystical people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members should be well aware of the elementary procedures of the House of Commons after the long time that they have spent here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting debate. We have heard that the Minister was stunned or astonished and that there has been great puzzlement in the Commitee. I refer to one of his attacks on COSLA—he should have no regrets about it not sending him its briefing material. I think that that is a challenge to COSLA, which may wish to consider it during the next few months while the Bill proceeds through the House. That is a matter for COSLA and the Minister, but there is little to be gained by the Minister liaising with a group that during the past 10 years the Government have ignored. I do not expect him to change the habits of a lifetime, but we are not surprised and do not regret the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have raised many matters for discussion and find the relationship between clause 7(5) and (3) very curious. A close reading of clause 7(5) suggests that the opportunity to provide evening and community education classes could be included in that subsection. The last three lines of that subsection state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and they may additionally provide such facilities (whether or not for those pupils) other than as part of the provision of school education."</p></blockquote>
Before I involve the Committee in a half-hour debate on the matter, perhaps the Minister will intervene to tell us the difference between subsections (5) and (3). On that distinction will hang the Opposition's case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is being a little unfair expecting me to give an immediate interpretation of the Bill. Clause 7(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board of management of a self-governing school shall, as part of the provision by them of school education, provide adequate facilities for pupils in attendance at the school,"</p></blockquote>
whereas we are discussing clause 7(3), which refers to the power to provide education other than school education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has completely missed the point, which is a consistent performance. I quoted the final three lines of subsection (5), which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and they may additionally provide such facilities (whether or not for those pupils) other than as part of the provision of school education."</p></blockquote>
It is on that point that the Minister should comment to clarify whether it differs from subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It was my intention to allow a clause stand part debate although my judgment in that respect is subject to my own scrutiny. I am sure that the Minister will deal with that point and he has attempted to answer it. The honourable Member should stick with the amendment, which refers to another part of the clause with which we are dealing and we might make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first contribution on the amendment and it is essential that the Minister should respond positively either now or in the stand part debate. It appears to Labour Members that subsection (3) is very different from the provisions of subsection (5) in that the cultural and community education aspects could be usefully absorbed under subsection (5). If that is the case, what is the need for subsection (3)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has taken the second last line of subsection (5), which includes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"(whether or not for those pupils)."</p></blockquote>
But those words relate to
	<br><blockquote><p>"social, cultural and recreative activities and for physical education and training",</p></blockquote>
whereas subsection (3) is about
	<br><blockquote><p>"education other than school education",</p></blockquote>
which goes far wider than physical education and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the honourable Gentleman is saying that the effect of clause 7(3) and 7(5) is to give a belt and braces commitment for self-governing schools to be able to offer a wide range of activities to the community, that is precisely what we intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) made a point about a philosophical or practical difference, but we merely seek an explanation of what the three lines of subsection (5) mean so that we may clarify subsection (3). the clarification offered by the Minister was inadequate. You, Mr. Hogg, suggested that he may wish to return to the matter in the clause stand part debate, so I shall leave it there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting debate, but our worries go far wider than the Minister's idle rhetoric about freedom of choice, vested interests and protecting trade unions and people and his claims that the Government are closer to sanity than the Labour party in the policies proposed in the Bill. But it is crucial that we should be given further clarification in the clause stand part debate of the essential differences between providing community education, which is something in which most
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
schools are involved, and the more specific aspects of further education. Those latter aspects are developing in the schools through adult education and many adults are returning to the classroom to obtain O-levels and Highers. There is a vital distinction between adult education, community education and the important area of further eduction. We cannot introduce anarchy in an area in the guise of extending choice and freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may be boring you, Mr. Hogg, but you are a Chairman who is rarely bored, so I shall leave the matter there and return to it on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the Minister went some way to answering my question. However he fell short at the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the possibility of a self-governing school providing an after-hours class using funds received directly from central Government. That could result in a class provided by the education authority becoming inviable because it might lose two or three students who would otherwise attend it. The Minister says that that might not be the case and that demand for the class might be not finite, but elastic. That might be so, but what will happen if demand for the class in any year is static?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall elaborate by giving a concrete example. In the Western Isles, the education authority might provide an after-hours class in French. It might find only 12 students interested in attending the class and that would put it on the border line of viability. After all, the education authority once had a duty to its ratepayers and now has one towards the poll tax payers to ensure that its funds are spent responsibly. The authority cannot make provision for classes that are too small to be viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the class of 12, which is on the borderline of viability, is being held in Stornoway. That is the most accessible point for members of the Lewis community. However, the secondary school in Bayble, which is only 5 miles away, might note that two of the students are from that village and might decide to offer an after-hours class in French using funds provided directly from central Government. Given that option, those two students will not travel the five or six miles to Stornoway, because they will make the rational decision to go to the school in Bayble for the after-hours class. As a consequence, the education authority school's class in French in Stornoway may be deprived of two of the students it requires to make it viable. If no further students come forward, the provision a class in Bayble will deprive 10 students of the opportunity to go to a similar class in Stornoway. That is a real possibility and it is one that we have sketched out in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister to say that demand might be elastic. It might prove not to be, and I suspect that it would not be in most examples. What will be the position of the 10 students who will no longer be able to receive lessons in the after-hours class of the education authority? Will they automatically be entitled to go to the class in Bayble? Will

	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
there be a net gain if 10 students travel five miles further and two students travel five miles less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman has now asked that question about five times. As a Scottish Presbyterian, I should think that language classes in a place called Bayble are unscriptural.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Presbyterian, Mr. Hogg, you will be used to detailed questions. I was hoping to elaborate on all the facets of my question in my brief remarks to save the Minister the trouble of my constant interventions each time he mentions a point that I have not covered. However, I appreciate, Mr. Hogg, that you wish to move us on as speedily as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will make a genuine attempt to reply to my question. I suggest that to cure the problem we could simply provide that a school wishing to make such an arrangements should discuss it with the education authority. Rather than being conflicting, the arrangements would be co-ordinated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the honourable Gentleman to start explaining the alternatives, but he did not explain how a self-governing school would manage to run a viable course with two people when the course with 10 people in the other school would not be viable. It was interesting that the honourable Gentleman thought that a self-governing school was a possibility in his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such a class could be provided through the money that the school saves from cutting the wages of non-teaching staff. The school might have an incentive to do so by charging those two Bayble students £5 a head. The Bayble students may be willing to pay that as they would not have to travel the five miles, and the school would make a nice little £10 profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am gratified to find the honourable Gentleman latching on to the arguments that were put forward by my honourable Friends earlier. If the self-governing school could provide a viable course for two people, just think what the benefits would be in terms of the low marginal costs and revenue for taking on the other 10. The honourable Gentleman may say that that would be unfair, because all 12 would then have to travel to an inconvenient location. He is supporting an amendment that would prevent the self-governing school from running any courses, so the 12 people could not choose which school to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not necessarily supporting any amendment; my support depends on the Minister's response. Can he guarantee that those 10 students could attend that school on the same terms as they would have attended the education authority school—for the same charge or lack of charge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that, as the honourable Gentleman is a member of the Opposition, he supports an amendment that was tabled by the Opposition. Perhaps that was a naive assumption. I shall not say
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
whether the honourable Gentleman put his name to the amendment, as that remains a matter of doubt, but in view of what he has told us, we are probably near the answer. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not support the amendment, which is designed to prevent self-governing schools from providing courses of any kind. he says that he is worried about the 10 people being told that the course is not viable, but at least they would have a choice in that the self-governing school would also be in the market to attract their custom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One valuable aspect of the debate is that the honourable Gentleman, by his persistence, has drawn my attention the fact that the Bill as drafted requires the self-governing schools to run only further education activities that are self-financing or incur only marginal costs, like those that I described in Strathclyde. The grant provided is for school education only, so perhaps that is a weakness. In view of the arguments that I have heard, and of the strength of feeling evident among my honourable Friends, I am happy to given an undertaking to review the system of funding and consider whether, when we make the grant regulations, we could provide room for manoeuvre to overcome the type of problem that causes concern to the honourable Gentleman and to other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That remark is insulting to you, Mr. Hogg, as I was paying you a compliment.

I wish to raise only one brief point, but it will probably take me a bit of a while—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a challenge to the honourable Gentleman, as he has mentioned Blackpool? If he could remain within order while making a link between the Blackpool tower and the tower of Babel he would be doing well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being a Presbyterian and having been brought up strictly, I know my Bible reasonably well. I often visit the churches in the constituency of my honourable Friend for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). I was there only last month, when I visited the wee church at Meavaig and discussed the Bill with the Minister there. In fact, we had an excellent erudite discussion of clause 7(3), during which we dealt with the very matter that I am about to raise. Before I do so I apologise to you, Mr. Hogg, if, not having been here for the Committee's earlier discussions on further education and adult education, I go over ground that someone else has already covered and ask questions that the Minister has already answered. If the Minister nods to me I shall sit down if that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I start my main argument I want to respond to something that the Minister has said about education for the interests of parents and pupils, not to meet the interests of the planners. So say all of us. Who said that education was about the interests of the planners? I infer from the Minister's remark that he thinks that a director of education for Lothian, Strathcylde, Tayside or Grampian does not have the interests of pupils at heart. I am sure that the Minister did not mean to say that and that he will wish to withdraw the implication when he winds up the debate. He should not besmirch directors of education by saying that they are interested only in themselves. That was an unprofessional slur by the Minister on extremely professional people. I am sure that he will wish to retract that, otherwise we shall infer that they are interested not in education but only in themselves. That may drive the Minister, but it does not drive directors of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss what is provided for in subsection (3). Are we talking about further or adult education? That is an important issue. I have attended an extramural evening class—a splendid phrase. I have studied philosophy which helped me as I have a problem with the definition of "school education". What does the word "school" mean? I can see how someone might use that to argue over the definition of school and I thought about that. It then became clear that introducing such definitions would be to the detriment of the school, which would not help. My philosophical training taught me that if it is not important to know the definition of a word, we should not bother about it at all. I cannot imagine that it would be helpful to argue over the definition of a self-administering school, so I shall not pursue the matter. The Minister will know that the nature of a word is in its use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A German philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the blue book or the green book. Having studied them, I must say that adult education was not too helpful in that
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory notes refer to adult education, but will further education be provided? If a school wants to teach knitting, that is fine. I say that with due deference to my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). When I was at school, I had to do technical subjects. I gather that it is now called home economics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor were girls allowed to join classes in joinery and technical education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, and the teachers were biased. My father was a technical teacher and he was very much opposed to women doing metalwork, woodwork and technical drawing. One year, when boys could not be fitted into another course, they did domestic science and it was highly successful. My school used to run first-aid evening classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks are relevant to subsection (3) and I am discussing the definition of adult education. Will adult education involve courses without requiring qualification certificates such as domestic science, philosophy, or even music, using the school's faciliites? Will courses for a City and Guild in butchery be available at Possilpark high school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister has one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dissociate myself from that remark. It is unworthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the crucial issue about whether people will be able to go on for further education, which is different from adult education. I can understand that teachers with a special interest might often want to give their time free for their classes. But that does not interfere with the provision in that area of further education, which is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education is not just a passing whim whereby people study architecture for a few nights, leave if they are fed up after three classes and so allow the class to break down. That happened to some of the extramural classes that I attended at university. After a big rush at the start, 20 or 30 people were ready to study logic, but after two classes we realised that it was beyond us, we all left and the class collapsed. That did not matter. No one's career or future job depended on it. The same happened to the architecture classes that some of my friends attended—they all fell away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a further education class, which is set up in competition with another class, breaks down and the other class has not started, that has a detrimental effect on the provision of such education. That is why the Opposition want to know the definition of "adult education". The notes on clauses for this subsection refer to "adult education" and we want to know whether that includes further education or whether it is limited to non-vocational courses of general interest to the public—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that conservative Members will not chase aunt sallies and red herrings and talk about Socialist centralisation, and the lust for planning that they frequently attribute to us. The amendment proposes a reasonable and sensible injunction—there is no compulsion or imposition—that the board of management of a self-governing school enters into an agreement with the education authority to ensure that this vital educational provision for children with special . needs is continued after a school has received self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there are quibbles about the form of the amendment, I hope that the Government will acknowledge that there should be a dialogue between education authorities, which have been responsible for special needs education in the past, and the new self-governing school boards of management about how that provision can be continued properly and effectively after the school becomes self-governing. I hope that the principle of a dialogue is accepted by both sides of the Committee so that we can make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every effort should be made to ensure that children with special educational needs do not suffer from the setting up of a self-governing school. To cater for such children is not an easy task. Appropriate facilities and teachers must be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
