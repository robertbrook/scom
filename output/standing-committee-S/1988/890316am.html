	<time>Thursday 16 March 1989</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are two honourable Members present who are not entitled to be on this Committee. They know of the powers that the House has given me. I ask them to leave. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Order. The honourable Members are not permitted to speak. [	<i>Interruption</i>]. Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That during the procedings on the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.— 	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall oppose the sittings motion and, in doing so, we shall take the opportunity to discuss what most Scots regard as a uniquely objectionable Bill. The sittings motion is about the allocation of time and we shall try to impress upon the Government the view that the way in which they have handled the Bill so far is, politically, a disgrace. We shall illustrate that and identify what has gone on in the past 18 months under the supervision of the Under-Secretary, the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Activities this week have shown that there is deep anger in Scotland about the Bill. We have dissociated ourselves from what we regard as the student antics of the Scottish National party, but I appreciate its frustration, as I understand that of my honourable Friends. Never in the past 30 to 40 years has a Bill been developed in such a shabby manner and never before in the history of Scottish education since the war has an Under-Secretary of State been at war with education interests, including teachers, parents, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Churches. After 18 months of neglect by the Government, we now have, as I have stated, a uniquely objectionable Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is far too easy for the Opposition to indulge in the type of protest to which I referred. However, there is a more meaningful way of demonstrating to Scots and honourable Members the odious nature of the proposals. That is what we intend to do this morning and throughout the stages of the Bill. We warn the Government that, although we have modest expectations about amending the Bill, the Committee stage is only part of a much wider campaign throughout Scotland. It is a friendless Bill and opting-out is poison to Scottish education. Every conceivable interest stands organised to fight it. But that is of no consequence to the Under-Secretary of State. He is on auto-pilot. He is not listening. His ideology has set him on a course
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
where he needs his close political hard-Right colleagues on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something even more significant about our attack: we will not give up the fight against the Bill, even when it becomes an Act. We will ensure that from the Orkneys to the Border every voter is aware of the utter contempt of Scottish education shown by the Scottish Office and, more particularly, by the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad that, unlike under Rab Butler, whom I quoted on Second Reading, we now have a dramatic deterioration of political standards. A system that has been built up over decades of painstaking work by many organisations is now to be dismantled at the whim of a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the Secretary of State for Scotland would be present this morning. The access that the Under-Secretary has to the Prime Minister is the corrosive influence on Scottish education. The Secretary of State should take control of his Minister's activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to interrupt the honourable Member, but we are discussing the sittings motion. He must keep to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion is about timing. I want to demonstrate that the way in which the Government are handling the sittings motion merely heaps insult upon injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires more time because Scottish education has been betrayed. I want to put on the record why the Bill and the Committee are a disgrace. On 27 May 1987, 	<i>The Scotsman</i> said that at a Conservative news conference in Edinburgh, both the Scottish chairman, Lord Goold, and the Minister responsible had confirmed that the Government would be pleased to see opting-out allowed in English schools, but not in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on BBC Radio Scotland on 9 April 1988, the Prime Minister was asked whether she would confirm that opting out of local authority control would go ahead in Scotland. She replied:
	<br><q><p>"No, I cannot confirm that it will definitely go ahead. The first thing we had to do was to see that every school has a school board."</p></q>
Can the Under-Secretary say how many school boards have been established in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable Lady went on to say that the Government would have to take further soundings to see whether sufficient number of people
	<br><q><p>"would like to have opting out as an option."</p></q>
Nearer home, the Under-Secretary of State said in the Scottish Grand Committee on 21 March 1988:
	<br><q><p>"We have always made it clear that if there is evidence of real and substantial demand for opting out, we would not stand in the way."—	<i>[Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 21 March 1988; c.37].</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
Finally, when debating the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, the Secretary of State for Scotland said on 12 April 1988:
	<br><q><p>"I have always made clear, in the election period and since, that given that we do not have a history of school boards or governors in Scotland of the kind that we are now creating, the first stage must be their creation. As my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary and others have said, we must then gauge whether there is a demand for a further power."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 12 April 1988; Vol. 131, c.34–5.]</p></q>
The Government's behaviour is a political disgrace. Lord Goold, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Under-Secretary are all on record as saying to the Scottish people that there would not be a Bill for opting-out until school boards had been established. Does the Under-Secretary want to intervene now to tell us why he has betrayed the trust of Scots on this issue? That is why we need more time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What evidence is there that the Scottish people have any trust in the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An excellent point. Most politicians expect that there will be a residue of trust and confidence in what they do. Education is not safe in the hands of this Minister. By their actions and words, the Government have shown that anything that they say cannot be taken seriously or as a reflection of their real intentions. It is important to state that the Bill is being bulldozed through and that the Minister should respond to that major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another crucial matter is the lack of consultation. Never in post-war history in Scotland has a Bill of such major significance been so rushed through every conceivable stage in the parly or democratic process. I challenge the Minister to tell us—and, with your forbearance Mr. Martin, he may take as long as he wishes—how many organisations have requested that opting-out be included in the Bill. The Minister is too busy writing. Not only does he show contempt for education, but he sits there doing his ministerial correspondence. He is now putting his pen away. Will he respond to the challenge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you confirm that it would be out of order for me to respond to matters of substance under the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All matters discussed at this stage must relate to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always accept your guidance, Mr. Martin, but I hope that 	<i>Hansard</i> will report that the Minister has started doing his correspondence again. He does so in utter contempt and 1 shall point out that every time because the proceedings of our Committee will not only be privy to honourable Members, but will be circulated widely to emphasise the Minister's contempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I was discussing consultation and why we want more time to debate the Bill. I am sure that the Minister has received a letter signed by J. Ian H. McDonald, convenor of the Church of Scotland Education Committee and John Oates, chairman of the Catholic Education Commission. Their letter, dated 8 March 1989, states:
	<br><q><p>"We the undersigned deplore the haste with which the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill has passed through its Parliamentary stages thus far, and the speed with which these procedures seem likely to be completed."</p></q>
The Church has made eloquently the point that we are making. The Minister must respond to that major attack on the Government by the Church in Scotland. He may ignore us, but can he ignore the Church?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent memorandum, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland states:
	<br><q><p>"Contrary to normal practice, the Government did not consult those involved before indicating its intention to introduce legislation."</p></q>
Again on timing, the Scottish Consumer Council told the Government to "Ca Canny". Although traditionally a friend of the Government, it argues that there has been no consultation. The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council referred to the obscene haste with which the Bill is being presented to Parliament. It argued that if opting-out is to be included in the Bill, it should be the subject of proper consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA represents 5 million people, 12 education authorities, councillors, 800,000 children, 1.5 million parents and 50,000 teachers, but 1 shall not burden the Minister by reading out its concerns and recommendations because he has said that it has a vested interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on ad infinitum identifying those involved in Scottish education who argue for more time for the Bill. We received a letter from the chairman of the Inverness Royal Academy School Council dated 3 March. The members of the council were unhappy that
	<br><q><p>"There is no apparent demand among parents for such schools."</p></q>
The Strathclyde school parents' federation made the same point. I have an interesting letter from Dumfries and Galloway regional council, which is not renowned for its Left-wing extremism. The Minister raises his eyebrows. I quote from the letter to honourable Members, dated 9 March 1989, from Mrs. Elizabeth J. Smith, chairman of the education committee:
	<br><q><p>"In particular, my Education Committee wishes to draw to your attention the fact that proposals for Self-Governing Schools were not contained in the Conservative Party Manifesto and that the Government are. therefore, placing a Bill before Parliament."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Unless the point that the honourable Member is making relates to the haste with which it is alleged that the Government are putting the Bill through Committee, I cannot allow that correspondence to be read out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall show courtesy and accept the wisdom of the Chair. In a later paragraph, Dumfries and Galloway regional council expresses its concern about that indecent haste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to show that there has been no consultation. This opting-out proposal has been dreamed up on the back of the Baker Act for England. It is supported by the ideologues at the Adam Smith Institute, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust and the Institute of Economic Affairs. For the first time, one of the Conservative Back Benchers recognises the organisations to which I am referring. Those organisations did not ask for more time to debate the Bill; they want the Bill to go through reasonably quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The composition of the Committee impinges upon the time taken in Committee. If there were 13 Conservative Members from Scotland with a wide knowledge of Scottish education, our sittings would be shorter and better informed. Unfortunately, English Conservative Members, some from the No Turning Back group who are colleagues of the Under-Secretary of State, are on the Committee. I do not want to incur your wrath, Mr. Martin, by going into detail about how ill-equipped those honourable Members are to deal with Scottish education. Suffice it to say that we believe in an egalitarian education system, but the honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horn-castle (Mr. Leigh) is described in "Parliamentary Profiles" as an
	<br><q><p>"elitist who favours 'the gifted and the able'."</p></q>
We shall need more time to examine the arguments of those honourable Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.50 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been very charitable; Scots are extremely angry about the ministerial abuse of the Committee of Selection. We accept that English Members are appointed to the Committee because we have a United Kingdom Parliament, but to select members from the No Turning Back group who wrote the pamphlet "Save our Schools"—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The nursery is in full cry, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As I said, I do not wish to intervene in the honourable Member's speech, but Members must not criticise the decision of the Committee of Selection, because it has nothing to do with this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the Committee of Selection was at fault, but that the names are submitted by the Government who choose who is to be on the Committee. I suggest that the Under-Secretary may be involved in the selection of that team, but if I am wrong I shall be delighted to give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a profound embarrassment to Scots in education. The composition of the Committee has merely heaped insult upon injury. The sittings motion is about timing. However, it may be appropriate to mention a piece of research in which the Under-Secretary is involved. The timing of that research is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
interesting. It is entitled "Survey of parents' views on school education in Scotland." I have a copy of the questionnaire and the interviewers' instructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the matter in relation to the sittings motion because the outcome of the survey will be delivered to the Government in June. Scottish parents will be consulted about the quality of education and parent-teacher school contact. In view of the amount of time that we shall spend on the Bill, would it not be appropriate to suspend the Committee and await the outcome of that magnificent survey? If the Scottish Office is to be given the outcome of the survey, the Committee's decisions will be of little relevance to Scottish parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will adjudicate on that matter later. The Committee will be influenced by the survey, which is to be carried out on the Government's behalf by MVA Consultancy of 27 York Place, Edinburgh EH1 DHP. The survey is supposed to advise the Government on parents' views. Unfortunately, only 3,400 parents will be questioned, but there are 800,000 children in Scottish education, so how representative will it be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with testing and teacher assessment; questions about those matters are contained in the survey. The Minister arranged the outcome of the survey to coincide with the conclusion of the Committee because the proposals have no justification, and he wishes to indulge in spending £132,000 of taxpayers' money to provide answers that are already known. The survey is a cynical, manipulative exercise and is intellectually flawed because it is biased, distorted and smacks of everything that we expect from the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend's reply will help me make my decision about the sittings motion. How will the 3,000 patients—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Once a doctor, always a doctor. I mean, how will the 3,000 parents be selected? Will they be spread across the social classes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand my honourable Friend's anguish, but I shall not indulge myself by giving a full reply. Suffice it to say that before the parents were interviewed for the survey they had to go through a screening process on the doorstep, by telephone and postal questionnaire. Was the aim to discover whether the people ultimately included in the survey would be the right type of people for the Minister? I shall not suggest that, because it would be a slight on the intellectual credibility of the Government and the Minister, and I do not indulge in such activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee's progress if I reply to the honourable Gentleman's point about timing. The survey was conducted by a professional agency according to its own standards. It is reprehensible of the honourable Gentleman to cast a slur on its methods. The sampling of the 20,000 parents in Scotland was intended to obtain a representative sample. If it would be helpful, I shall endeavour to obtain an interim report on the survey, which was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
carried out professionally. What does the honourable Gentleman fear that it might reveal about parental opinion on education that he finds it necessary to cast a slur on the survey in advance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not slur the consultants. Two sets of consultants are involved. Gordon Simmons Research Ltd is carrying out the fieldwork. I am sure that both sets are excellent organisations. They both operate from Surrey, but that is a side issue. The slur is the fact that the Scottish Office is manipulating surveys and using taxpayers' money. That is a serious accusation and I want the Minister to publish in the press the detailed background to the screening process, who is being selected and in which areas and for what purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey begins by mentioning the quality of education and contact between school and parents. None of the 72 questions strikes at the heart of the quality of education, which is about improving standards, O-levels Highers, grades and the quality of teaching. The survey deals only with school uniforms and prizegivings, so it will be used further to undermine Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been thoroughly discredited. Forty seven of its 72 clauses deal with the issue of opting-out, which has never appeared in a manifesto and has not been subject to consultation. It has been derided by every serious organisation in Scotland but has been railroaded this far, after Lord Goold, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary betrayed the people on school boards who trusted them. To say that they were economical with the truth would not capture how they abused those people's trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of the Bill is crucial. We expect it to run for at least six months. We want to take English Tory Members of Parliament, particularly those on the hard Right, round Scotland. We shall have an A to Z of Scottish education for them. In fact, we shall have a map—Scotland is the bit to the north of Watford, although other parts of England intervene. There is massive ignorance about education. The Bill will be bulldozed through the Committee without adequate representation of Scottish education interests. And, as if the timing were not bad enough—	<i>[Interruption.)</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for, Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) has gone to find out where Scotland is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, well. 1 shall not ask for your indulgence, Mr. Martin. The Conservative party has about 370 honourable Members in the House. On the first Division call during our first sitting, one of the far Right Conservative Members, the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) pops up to show us that he is alive and disappears to another United Kingdom Committee. Does that reflect the educational poverty of the Minister's team, or does it show that, even if the Government look beyond Scottish Members, they cannot find enough sane and sympathetic people to populate the Committee? The ho-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
nourable Gentleman has just returned after voting. 1 shall end my comments there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultancy survey is the final insult. It is the icing on the cake for the hard Right of the Conservative party. Conservative Members listen to no one. They bring forward a Bill that has no support and then seek to justify it by framing a consultancy questionnaire whose answers will be another tool to use against Scottish education. Is it any wonder that Scots are furious about the Bill and the ministerial abuse that it reflects?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned two or three issues that I think are germane. The Government should take them seriously. They never want to listen to the Labour party, the Scottish National party, or the Social and Liberal Democratic party. But will the Minister listen to those who have an interest in Scottish education? They not only despise the Bill, but they are becoming dismayed by the Minister's smears and attacks. The group of people that the Minister has angered so much ranges from the Churches in Scotland to individual voters and honourable Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised at the start that the campaign would run and run. We have begun with the sittings motion, but we shall address each clause and table amendments that will bring the Bill back from sheer farce to fiction. The poll tax was a major issue in Scotland. This Bill tears the heart out of Scottish education. It is politically dishonest and educationally divisive. The Opposition will not relent until opting-out is scrapped. That is unlikely under this Government. But when we form a Government, one of our first tasks will be to ensure that opting-out is assigned to the political dustbin, along with the few Conservative Members who remain in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that our sittings should be delayed so that more time can be given to debating the principles of the Bill. He argued that Churches, educationists, councils, COSLA and uncle Tom Cobbley and all oppose the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Committee should sit to debate the principles of the Bill so that they are properly understood. The Bill does not force anyone to do anything. It gives people a choice. The Opposition have talked much in recent months about consumers. The consumers in this instance are parents and children, and it is right that they have a choice and are able to exercise that choice as soon as possible. More importantly, it is right that the principles of the Bill are properly debated.

I adopt the same position as the honourable Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) on the alleged protest. I am prepared to meet the nationalists head on in my constituency. I have seen them off three times, and I shall do so as often as they wish to challenge me. I am prepared to do so on the principles of the Bill. Contrary to the suggestion made by the Honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), I have no difficulty in finding my way

around Scotland. I began my working life as a message boy, so I was taught to find my way around. I have learnt not to get lost, and not to go to doctors who confuse parents and patients. They are sure to give you a bum steer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that the honourable Member for Fife, Central and his honourable Friends will propose reasoned amendments, which the Government look forward to examining. The honourable Gentleman claims that the Government are trying to anglicise Scottish education. If the Opposition believe that, I trust that they will not table amendments to bring the Bill into line with English legislation. If they do, they can be accused of trying to anglicise Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that the words "Englishing" and "anglicisation" have been used, but they are not terms that I use.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not ducking the question. I am not in the habit of ducking questions, as the Scottish Nationalists in my constituency have discovered. I regularly expose their lies and fraud. [Honourable Members: "Oh".] I have evidence of the lies and fraud. The Scottish National party, by trying to prevent the sittings motion and a full debate on the principles of the Bill, has proved again that it has no interest in Scottish education or any other matter. Its members are interested only in disruption and breaking the law. Yet if they were to achieve office, they would expect people to obey their laws. Scottish people will see through that nonsense.

I hope that nationalist Members who do not wish to sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays will not, as people of principle, draw their salaries as Members of the House, claim their expenses or use their travel warrants between London and Scotland. Because they oppose sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays on principle, we should expect them to exercise that principle fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should stop talking about the need to sit and instead proceed with the Bill. We agreed that we needed to do something when we gave you, Mr. Martin, power and authority that I welcome and have seen you exercise, and hope that you will continue to exercise. You have always handled Committees responsibly and I hope that we will be allowed to proceed quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are discussing a sittings motion to establish a Committee to examine a Bill for which there is no demand whatever. It has no mandate by way of support for the Government or from the intentions that the Government announced before the election. That has been well said by the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I came to the House in 1964, there was a popular story doing the rounds about the first visit to the Chief Whip's Office of a Conservative Member who rejoiced in the rolling onomatopoeic name of Van Straubenzee. The Chief Whip looked him up and down, from bald pate to shiny shoes, and said, "Van Straubenzee, that rhymes with McKenzie, Scottish Committee for you". A variant of that principle appears to be in operation now; something that I have not seen in my 25 years in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last thing on earth that would cross my mind would be to criticise another Committee of the House, as you, Mr. Martin, have already mentioned that matter to the honourable Member for Fife, Central. At any rate, if it did cross my mind, I would not articulate it in deference to you, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask some practical questions about the sittings motion. It is Delphic and unclear about the sitting times. It says when the Committee should start but nothing about when it is due to finish, and the latter is every bit as important as the former. We start at 10.30 am and go on until 1 pm. In the afternoon we start at 4.30 pm and sit until we get an hour to eat. I should have thought that most Conservative Members would need more than an hour, but, on the Opposition Benches, with our medical adviser present, we accept that as reasonable. However, a little bird has told me that we would then return to our labours and sit even verily until 10 pm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have escaped the notice of the wise people who make such determinations, but if one lives in the north of Scotland rather than the central belt, sitting until 10 pm leaves one without a bat's chance in whatever it is of catching a sleeper to Inverness or Aberdeen. That is unreasonable on a Thursday, although I admit that it does not apply on a Tuesday. Why has no consideration been given to that problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand—I dare say that this will be an unpopular remark even with Opposition Members on the Committee—why a sittings motion and a negotiated timetable motion cannot be combined. On a long Bill, a great deal of time, energy and wind is expanded on the first few clauses. The Government create a fuss over not having enough time, a rigid timetable motion is slapped on, and inadequate time is left to discuss the later part of the Bill. That is not sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Member for Fife, Central, said, the Government have the majority, irrespective of how representative they may be, and they will get their way. But surely it would be better to discuss the Bill in a balanced and sensible way over the whole

I support the sittings motion. This is a very important Bill. I began my Committee life 10 years ago when I was privileged to be placed on a Scottish Standing Committee. It is appropriate that the Committee of Selection chose me on my 10th anniversary as a Member of the House to serve on another important Scottish Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an honourable Member who has so far served on three Standing Committees this session and who has been in Standing Committee since last November, I wish to make it clear that the Committee of Selection or the Government Whips would have taken it into consideration if I had said that I did not wish to serve on this Committee. The fact is that I volunteered and was anxious to serve on it.

My honourable Friend the Minister, contrary to the view put forward by Opposition Members, is not an extreme Right winger but a moderate man. My task in the Committee is to ensure that there is no backsliding. Opposition Members do not understand how meek, mild and reasonable my honourable Friend the Minister is. To ensure that there is no backsliding, it is essential that he has strong men behind him. It is an excellent Bill, but my honourable Friend the Minister has a reputation for conceding amendments to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of conceding amendments, I do not wish to indulge in a game of ministerial mugging, but if the Under-Secretary is a moderate in Scotland, what does that make you and your honourable Friends from the No Turning Back group, which produced the pamphlet, "Save our Schools"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), I believe that we need sufficient time to debate the Bill in Committee. Then, its principles will be properly understood by Conservative Back Benchers, who do not understand it at all, and the Scottish people. That is why it is important that the Committee is not given a date by which to finish, be it in April, May or even June. We must properly debate all 72 clauses and 11 schedules and expose their implications to honourable Members, and to the parents and people in Scotland who will be following our proceedings in the press. I am interested to know what date the Government Whip, the honourable Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), will propose for completing the Committee stage. I suspect that he will suggest that we take the Bill back to the House after a nonsensically short period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to decide timetable is with the Government, not the Opposition. That is not because of domestic consent given by the people of Scotland. We live in, perhaps, the most deformed democracy in western Europe. In fact, we do not live in a democracy - that applies not just to the Scottish people, but to those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The House is a very deformed institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of negotiating the timetable so that the Bill is properly debated, but we have learnt that it is not possible to negotiate with the Government. They impose whatever they wish on Scottish Members and the Scottish people. I suspect that that will happen with this Bill. I must say to the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) that I did not support the disruptive tactics of the Scottish National party because I want the Bill to be debated in the House and the arguments to be exposed through the media to the Scottish people. If we had supported the SNP's tactics, the Minister would not have had to open his mouth and the Bill would have been returned to the Floor of the House undebated and unexposed. That would only have played into the Minister's hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Government seek to cut the debate and prevent the arguments from being exposed by axing the Committee in April or early May, I would not object then to trying to disrupt the Bill's progress. It is unacceptable to impose the Bill on the Scottish people without allowing it to be debated properly in Committee and on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady will probably disagree, but the SNP should have had the courage of its convictions and made a serious attempt to disrupt the Committee. The first tactical mistake of the honourable Lady and her honourable Friends was to come into the Committee Room together. If honourable

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to do that and to discuss whether we should have a sittings motion because the SNP's tactics have been to prevent the Committee from sitting. I am trying to deal with that because it is a legitimate argument about the sittings motion. Should we have a sittings motion, or should we disrupt it here and now? I am saying to the honourable Lady that the SNP made no serious attempt to do that and its action was purely a publicity stunt to draw attention to the party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view was confirmed when I discovered that, instead of the Serjeant at Arms being called in this morning the SNP Members had left meekly. Kenny McAskill once said that the SNP had the courage of the Labour party's convictions. It would seem that only the honourable Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) has the courage of the SNP's convictions because the other SNP Members tripped out of the Committee meekly like wee mice, when they were told to leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I suggest that the Committee should not sit on Thursday mornings. The Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a member of the Committee, is attached to 10 Downing Street by an invisible wire that pulls him along to Cabinet meetings on Thursday mornings. He gets his instructions on what to do about Scotland every Thursday morning and his absence from our debates on Thursdays would be a serious omission. The Bill gives powers to the Secretary of State for Scotland to decide what percentage of parents must vote for opting-out before he gives permission for a school to opt out. It is important that he makes clear to the Committee what percentage would be acceptable to him to allow a school to opt out of the local authority's control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Only 24 per cent of those who voted in Scotland supported the Tories at the previous general election, but only 18 per cent. of the whole electorate voted for them. As the Secretary of State thinks that that is a sufficient mandate for the Tories to rule in Scotland, he may think that 18 per cent. of the parents is a sufficient mandate for the school to opt out. If we debate that part of the Bill on a Thursday, the Secretary of State should be here to tell us what standards will apply when he makes that judgment. The Minister should agree that we do not meet on Thursday mornings so that the Secretary of State can attend all the sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) said that we shall sit again at 4.30 pm today and that on Tuesday nights we shall sit until the next morning. The Bill will not be properly debated because the Government are anxious to railroad it through as quickly as possible. They do not have sufficient Back Benchers to deal with it. That is why the Committee is stacked with members of the far Right who are sitting on the far right of the Room, which is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must question the quality of the membership imposed on the committee by the Tory Whips. For example, the parliamentary biography of the honourable Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) states that he is an
	<br><q><p>"ambitious, orthodox, Rightwing … abortion-obsessed bachelor."</p></q>
Those qualities eminently qualify him for the company of the Under-Secretary, but not to make a serious contribution to the debate. If, as stated in his parliamentary profile, he is in favour of flogging muggers and rapists, and if he applied that philosophy to those who are mugging and raping Scottish education, he would wish to see the Under-Secretary flogged, perhaps publicly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the honourable Gentleman a wee bit unfair? Has he not noticed the presence of the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker)? Does he not remember the biblical quotation, "His strength is as the strength of ten?" In view of the multi-purpose experience of the honourable Member for Tayside, North, does his presence not make up for a whole galaxy of others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had the displeasure of serving with the honourable Member for Tayside, North on four Scottish Committees in this Parliament. He has well earned the name "wandering Willie" because he wanders all over the place and rarely makes a serious contribution to the debate. I warn him about jumping to the defence of the honourable Member for Hexham, who is on record as saying that the Liberals are dominated by the loony Left. It shows how little he understands of Scottish politics that he describes someone like the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Jonston) as a loony Left winger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
We were discussing whether we shall have sufficient time for the honourable Member for Hexham and others to contribute to the debate. The honourable Gentleman is also on record as criticising the right of the accused to remain silent. I do not normally do that, but in Committee I criticise the right of honourable Members to remain silent while a Bill is railroaded through. I hope that the honourable Member for Hexham and all Conservative Back Benchers will not only contribute to the debate but will listen and perhaps learn, so that they do not make absurd interventions such as that of the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), who said that there was no need to make concessions. If this repulsive legislation ever reaches the statute book, it should do so only in a hugley amended form so that it reflects public opinion in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we have enough time to debate the Bill. Only a few weeks ago, I attended a meeting to discuss school boards at a school in Dundee, which was convened by the parents' association. I have a copy of the leaflet issued by the Scottish Office. The parents gathered to discover whether school boards were a good thing, whether they should become involved and what impact they would have on Scottish education. Before parents have had the chance to discuss that, we are discussing legislation that goes a thousand miles beyond school boards and makes radical changes. There was complete shock at that meeting when I outlined the Bill. No democratic consent to the Bill has been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the ranting and raving of Conservative Members who say that a unitary Parliament can do whatever it likes to the people of Scotland. It must be remembered that within the unitary Parliament, there is a separate system of Scottish Standing Committees and Scottish Office Ministers, and we used to have Scottish Select Committees. Scottish business should be dealt with separately by Scottish Members. That was the concession of this unitary Parliament, but it has not been conceded for this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My honourable friend the Member for Fife, Central was kidding the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes about having to rush out for Divisions in another Committee. That affects me as well, because I serve on the Committee considering the Local Government and Housing Bill. The first three parts of that Bill affect Scottish people, so it is important to have Scottish representation. That Committee has almost dealt with those parts, so I hope that this Committee will proceed slowly to begin with, to allow me the time to make a contribution along the Corridor and then dash back here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serving on these two Committees gives me an insight into two different ways in which the House deals with Scottish business. I do not know which is worse— this Scottish Standing Committee, which is packed with English Back Benchers who are ignorant of Scot-

tish education, or that Committee with only two Scottish Opposition Back Benchers to consider a UK Bill dealing with Scottish business. They are probably equally repugnant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Committee is to have any credibility in Scotland, it should take sufficient time to examine the Bill clause by clause, schedule by scheduale, line by line. If the honourable Member for Tayside, North thinks that he has a case, let him have the time to make it. The Bill must not be rushed through, it must be debated and the arguments must be deployed. The Minister must not impose a timetable on the Committee because the holiday period is approaching and we shall be away for almost two weeks. If the Government want to be seen to be taking the Bill seriously, they must remain in Committee for as long as it takes properly to debate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it not appropriate for the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) to withdraw his remark, as it is incorrect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was put to me that the honourable Member for Eastwood told a lie. He does not tell lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. The honourable Member for Eastwood said that Opposition Members are Whipped when abortion legislation is considered. That is factually incorrect. Should he not withdraw that remark?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has put that point on the record and I think that all members of the Committee accept what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russel Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it in order to raise points of order about matters that are not in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to say that that was not allowed, but often that is difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) obviously belongs to "The Wogs Begin at Tay-

port" school of thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot allow such remarks. We do not want to hear such terms in the Committee. I remind honourable Members that they have an obligation to restrict their remarks to the matter before us, which is the sittings motion. Some honourable Members are trying my patience. I ask the honourable Gentleman to pay due regard to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall not refer again to the display of remarkable discourtesy by the honourable Member for Dundee, East, who made his speech and departed immediately for other pastures. I see that he is now back. If the honourable Member for Dundee, East thinks that Brigg and Cleethorpes is in the south-east of England, he needs a map. My honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) does not represent a constituency in the south-east of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the honourable Gentleman will draw a distinction between me and the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). I readily admit that I am not familiar with English geography but neither do I attempt to sit on Committees that deal soley with English legislation. The Local Government and Housing Bill applies to Scotland: I am dealing with the Scottish issues covered by that Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are delighted to have the honourable Gentleman's assurance that he will not vote on the Floor of the House, or on any other Committee of which he is a member, on matters relating solely to England or any other part of the United Kingdom. That is the honourable position taken by the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and her colleagues, who never vote on matters relating to England, but it is the first time that a Labour Member has taken that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly undertake not to vote on those parts of the Local Government and Housing Bill that refer to England if members of the Committee who represent English constituencies do not vote on this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the position that the honourable Gentleman took earlier. If he is now saying that he will not vote in Standing Committees, or on the Floor of the House on matters that apply soley to England, Wales or Northern Ireland, I have no doubt that my honourable Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) and his colleagues in the Whips' office will welcome that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was unfair of Opposition Members to criticise my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes for voting on other Standing Committees. The honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) is a member of another Standing Committee, as is the honourable Member for Dundee, East. I do not criticise them for that, but there are 49 of them and they should be consistent.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
I welcome the sittings motion for several reasons. First, it is important that Opposition Members get an early opportunity, at great length, if that is in order, to make clear their position on many issues. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) will no doubt wish to refer at length, and at an early stage, to the expressed views of councillor Christopher Mason, the leader of the Democratic group on Strathclyde regional council, about the principles of the Bill. I am sure that the honourable Gentleman will wish to place the view of councillor Mason on the record before my honourable Friend the Minister, does so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I welcome the sittings motion because the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will wish to put her view about several detailed matters on the record. On Second Reading, the honourable Lady said, of one letter about the Bill—that she had received:
	<br><q><p>"It was from the parents of a child in Neilston school; the school which was the loser in the debate about Paisley grammar." 	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c.679.</p></q>
I have no doubt that the honourable Lady will wish to expand on that statement, especially as Neilston school is not only 10 miles from Paisley but is a primary school, wholly unaffected by secondary school reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin, I shall accept your ruling. The sittings motion is important because the honourable Lady may wish to expand on her views about the relationship between Neilston primary school and Paisley grammar school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly I welcome the sittings motion because the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) should have the opportunity to expand on his views at considerable length early in the proceedings, for the benefit of the debate in Scotland. The honourable Gentleman will wish to expand on his views on two points in the interests of parents and Scottish education. On Second Reading, he said:
	<br><q><p>"We should be investing in failure".—	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c.695.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many honourable Members would have the humility to accept that that should have been, "We should not be." I cannot correct later something that I have said. It is spurious and displays the poverty of the honourable Gentlemans argument, that he takes a factual error, which was made in all sincerity, in a Second Reading speech. Are Conservative Members stooping to such a low level of argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman makes my point for me. It is important for a full debate to take place at an early stage so that the honourable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Member for Fife, Central can make his position clear. The honourable Gentleman will want the sittings motion so that he can correct what was wrongly reported in 	<i>Hansard</i> on Second Reading. All honourable Members can check that the report is factually correct, and many do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Fife, Central will also wish to support the sittings motion to expand his view, expressed on Second Reading, that the Bill is about taking a school out of the state sector. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not suggest that that is an error in 	<i>Hansard,</i> because he also repeated that view in the debate on my new clause and amendment, tabled during the Committee stage of the School Boards (Scotland) Bill. A year later, the Government still holds the view that the Bill takes schools out of the state sector. It does nothing of the sort. In a sense, it brings schools into the state sector, because a self-governing school will have a direct relationship with central Government rather than with the local authority. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will expand on his view because it is a misunderstanding of the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. If the debate is to open out to include clause 1, I hope that the Government Whip or the Under-Secretary will tell us when that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am doing my best to ensure that the debate does not open out to include clause 1. I have asked for the co-operation of honourable Members, but I stress again that we are discussing the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin, and I shall not open the debate out to include clause 1. I simply say to the honourable Member for Fife, Central that he should welcome the sittings motion, because, it passed, it will give him the opportunity to expand on his view that the Bill takes schools out of the state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope other Opposition Members will welcome the sittings motion for other reasons. The honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) will wish to give the Committee his expertise on Catholic schools, such as Notre Dame and Our Lady of St. Francis. I hope to raise the important issues of St. Aelred's. I welcome the sittings motion because I also want to explore the view of Opposition Members on the proposals of Strathclyde regional council for the reorganisation of schools. Let us accept the sittings motion and move on to those detailed debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to hear Mr. Martin, that the points that I shall make are all relevant to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial parts of the Bill relate to further education. However, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State saw fit to speak on that subject for approximately 10 column inches of 	<i>Hansard.</i> The Under-Secretary did not respond to the points made on further education, which covered 80 column inches of 	<i>Hansard.</i> That shows how little attention the Government have given to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that it was not possible for me to respond to all the points made. I shortened my speech to allow the honourable Lady to participate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Under-Secretary's courtesy in shortening his speech, as did the Opposition spokesperson, but that was only necessary because Conservative Members, who know nothing at all about Scottish education, deliberately wasted the time of the House by speaking at length from a position of ignorance. In addition, it is probable that many Conservative Members voted on Second Reading without hearing any of the debate on further education. Therefore, they voted for clauses about which they had given no thought whatsoever. That might not be unusual, but the Bill requires the fullest possible examination in Committee because it did not get it on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains nothing about the education of the under-fives in Scotland. Some time ago, the Under-Secretary ordered the Scottish Education Department's study on the education of the under-fives to be abandoned on the grounds that the Department had other priorities. The Opposition believe that the under-fives are a high priority and we shall consider whether to introduce new clauses to deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Lady agree with Strathclyde regional council's proposals for the education of the under-fives, which have been formulated by an official imported from ILEA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the honourable Lady not to respond to that question, but to continue as before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the honourable Gentleman cannot tempt me to stray from the point that I was making. We shall deal with that matter if we have an opportunity to table new clauses about the education of the under-fives. The Government do not want to discuss the under-fives, but getting children off to a good start is recognised by educationists as a valuable aspect of education. Those who have had the advantage of attending a playgroup or nursery school often fare better when they reach primary school. The Government's lack of interest is shown in the composition of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable that there are no women Members on the Government Benches, whereas there are two on the Opposition Benches. I am not criticising the Committee of Selection. Did the Government recommend the inclusion of women? I am also a member of the Committee debating the Employment Bill down the Corridor. There are no Tory women on that Committee either, yet in both cases we are discussing legislation that affects women and, in this case, schoolgirls. The House is often likened to an English public school for boys, but do the Government need to ensure that it is by not including a single honourable Member who has had experience of being educated as a girl? As Conservative Members on this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
Committee cannot have had that experience, they should at least have sought the advice of their women colleagues who are as competent as they are. Some are as Right wing as they are, if that was troubling them. However, Conservative Members, some of whom are from an English public school background, dare to tell us how to run schools in Scotland. Scotland has an egalitarian society, which believes in equal rights for women. The Committee is composed of people who do not believe in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is presumably why the honourable Member for Glasgow, Gardscadden (Mr. Dewar) is not a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just childish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must not go too deeply into the membership of the Committee. I have already pointed out that no one here has any control over it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not criticising the exclusion of a particular individual. The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is illogical. The Government saw fit not to recommend that a female Conservative Member should participate in the Committee. That is strange, but it typifies the English public schoolboys' attitude that pervades the House and will colour the attitude of Conservative Members to the issues that we debate. Therefore, the women members of the Committee will have to spend even longer telling them about the education of girls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is called the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill. I am normally calm and reasonable, but in response to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) I must set the record straight. I taught boys and girls for eight years. I spent one and a half years as an assistant principal at a college of further education. I served on a local education committee for 10 years, was chairman of it for seven years and the schools that we ran were mixed, just for boys, and just for girls. I was also a member of the Committee that considered the Education Reform Bill, which sat for many months. I volunteered for this Committee because it deals with education and I look forward to its deliberations.

The principles involved are simple—parental choice, school freedom and diversity in education— and apply throughout the United Kingdom. I am a Member of the United Kingdom Parliament. If Opposition Members accept that an hereditary peer can speak on behalf of and champion the cause of the working class, it is only fair that they accept that someone who is well versed in education matters has the right and the responsibility to speak on education affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to speak briefly and shall try to use temperate language, despite the severe provocation to which I have been subjected during this morning's proceedings.

It seems that the price of having one dissident Scottish Conservative Member on the Committee is to have five hatchet men appointed by the Committee of Selection. It would have been strange if both dissident Conservative Members from Scotland had been appointed to the Committee, which was their right in view of their strong speeches on Second Reading. As all of us have received letters from the Dumfries and Galloway regional council education committee, the honourable Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) would have particularly liked to serve on the Committee. However, as we have five hatchet men for one dissident Tory, we might have had more hatchet men if two dissident Tories were on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen with interest to Tory Members' comments during our discussions because I am genuinely interested in education and I take gross exception to the remarks of the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I have worked in the education system for a considerable party of my life. After coming through the Scottish education system, I had the pleasure of attending two of its universities. I also worked in the further education sector. Therefore. I have a broad knowledge of the Scottish education system and care deeply about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Ste-war) seems to spend his time trawling through 	<i>Hansard</i> looking for small errors made by people in a debate as if he were claiming the right of infallibility for himself. I do not accept that. If I made a mistaken reference to Neilston, I should have corrected it in 	<i>Hansard.</i> However, sometimes honourable Members have other pressing duties. The reference should have been to Stanely Green. I do not claim to be infallible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not because the honourable Gentleman has had more than enough time today to make his comments. I sat through much abuse from honourable Members without intervening and I shall now say my piece about the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are yellow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand that the honourable Member made an unwarranted remark and I hope that he will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If any unwarrented remark is attributed to me by 	<i>Hansard</i> I shall, of course, withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not good enough. The honourable Member has no right to make such a remark to the honourable Lady. It is not up to 	<i>Hansard,</i> but it is up to the honourable Member. I ask him to withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Martin. The honourable Lady did not give me a chance to speak, but if any sotto voce remark attributed to me is unwarrented, I shall withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. At no time during my speech did I refer directly to the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). The honourable Lady may say that she was incensed by what I said about her, but I assure the Committee that nothing I said was directed at her personally; nor did I impugn her integrity. The honourable Lady should not attack me in this way, Mr. Martin, and I seek your defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Lady took those remarks personally, that is not a matter for the Chair. The honourable Gentleman has made his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been verbal abuse not only from honourable Members who are on their feet but from those who are seated. That has been typical of our proceedings this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have argued that we need time to explore and develop the proposals in the Bill, but we could do that in Scotland. It is not necessary to subject ourselves to the many problems in the Corridors of Westminster. There is a strong argument for the action taken in other directions to make Scottish people aware of what is happening. It is not good enough to be the chattering classes at Westminster. We must ensure that we have an effect on those in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now well understood how this Committee has been established. Six Members of Parliament who are members of this Committee do not know or understand Scottish education. If they want to take an interest in it, they have a great deal of homework to do in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not prepared to be lectured on tactics by the honourable Member for Dundee, East. If he contains his impatience a little longer, he may see different developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond to the point made by my honourable Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston), whose constituency adjoins mine. We are worried about the practicalities of a Thursday sitting that goes on until 10 pm. Unlike those taken by other honourable Members, our sleeper train leaves at 9.30 pm. Instead of hourly flights from Heathrow, there are only three flights a day to Inverness, so the earliest that we could reach our constituencies would be very late on Friday morning. All Scottish Members understand how important Fridays are to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that aspect will be considered. I am happy to sit through the night to debate this legislation because it is vital, but the Under-Secretary should take into account our responsibility to our constituents, particularly on Fridays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not usual for me to intervene in such matters. I was unaware that the last train for honourable Members whose constituencies are so far north leaves at 9.30 pm. I hope that the constituency duties of those honourable Members will be considered, so that they can be as conscientious as possible in Committee. I have no power in the matter,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
but I hope that that aspect will be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that a major concern for Scots was the fact that honourable Members representing English constituencies were members of the Committee. That point was taken up by the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) who referred to six hatchet men, meaning six Members of Parliament who know or understand nothing about Scottish education. The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) went further and said that the six Members representing English constituencies are totally ignorant of the Scottish education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two comments which, I assure you, Mr. Martin, are within the scope of the motion. The extent to which honourable Members for English constituencies take part in the Committee will have an impact on the time available. There is a close link between my points and the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that there is resentment about English Members intervening on controversial Scottish education legislation. My mind goes back to the Education Reform Bill, which dealt with the English education system. The Opposition regularly voted in serried ranks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had high hopes of the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine). We are discussing the sittings motion, not other legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The extent to which English Members intervene in debates is closely linked to the time available. An amendment to the Education Reform Bill is of relevance to this Bill. It was a Labour amendment to require a review of the Inner London education authority before its abolition on 1 April 1990. The relationship between local authorities and parents and between local authorities and central Government is at the heart of this Bill. That amendment was about education and parents in London. Every Labour Member voted on it. Fair enough—they were entitled to. I do not object to that. But if the Labour Members vote on matters concerning London, it does not lie well in their mouths to talk about resentment that English Members are to discuss and vote on Scottish education issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was not going to allow the honourable Member to speak for too long on that matter—he said that he would just touch on it. If he were to touch on the sittings motion, that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be fair to Opposition Members. They were guilty of voting on that amendment and so was the honourable Member for Moray. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) was not present on that occasion. He is the sole instance of virtue, or rather consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members assume that because we re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
present English constituencies, we know little about Scotland and less still about the Scottish education system. I recently spoke on the telephone with my aunt from Scotland—my grandfather was born in Fife. She was in a state. I had been described in the Scottish press as a "bovver boy" and "an Englishman". She was much more upset that I was described as "an Englishman" than as a "bovver boy". I was the first member of my family to be educated mainly in England. I had a taste of Scottish education for a short time as a small boy in Edinburgh, and shall take an interest in that school. I may have been brought south by the scruff of my neck by my parents, but I shall take a particular interest in the Bill. I am sure that all my honourable Friends who have English constituencies intend, as I do, to take a proper, serious and constructive part in the deliberations of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to hear that contribution from the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine). I have been more fortunate than the honourable Gentleman because I was born in England and dragged by the scruff of my neck up to Scotland, so I am one of those decanted Scots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy about the sittings motion, especially after hearing the honourable Member for Ipswich. I have enjoyed the proceedings so far. It would be a shame to rush through the Committee. I should like to spin out the proceedings and enjoy every moment. I especially enjoyed the contribution from the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who spoke in his usual combative, aggressive, pointed and erudite manner. I look forward to hearing more of his contributions. We should not have the sittings motion so that we can savour every moment of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Peter Riddle's description of the honourable Member for Tayside, North is quoted in the honourable Gentleman's Parliamentary profile. He is described as one of the
	<br><q><p>"few prize idiots who have got themselves in the class of the permanently unpromotable!"</p></q>

I was disappointed by the contribution from the honourable member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I know the honourable Gentleman well—we sit next to each other on the shuttle and underground. I need more time to explore his views at greater leisure. We have many things in common, but they should not affect the time that we have on the sittings motion. The honourable Gentleman and my honourable Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie

(Mr. Worthington) are unusual in being the only Scottish Members to represent district councils that are held by Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also share a great interest in Paisley grammar school. The Bill is, in part, the brainchild of the honourable Member for Eastwood and relates to what he wishes to do in Paisley. The Bill comes out of ideological spite, prejudice, meanness and twisted behaviour, but we should remember the two people who instigated the legislation, one of whom is the honourable Member for Eastwood. Paisley grammar was in the former Renfrewshire education authority. We need more time to explain the background and we should not rush through the sittings motion. I suggest that we spin out the debate so that the honourable Gentleman can go back to the days of the Renfrewshire education authority and Paisley grammar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my education authority, that was the school that had social cachet. The only difference between it and others in the authority, bar one, was that it played rugby, not football.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to help the honourable Gentleman on timing.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. We do not want to rush. We need time to discuss the point. We do not want to rush. We need time to discuss the issues, elsewhere perhaps informally, so that when we come to Committee, our arguments will have been put together cogently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why this sittings motion has been proposed. The Minister is keen for the Bill to be accepted rapidly because of what happened to his honourable Friend who is steering the Water Bill through the House. If the Opposition could spin out the debate, line up the arguments against the Bill and show how stupid it is, the Minister might receive the same treatment as his honourable Friend, who was kicked round the room by the Prime Minister and in an incredible display of masochism, then said how wonderful everything was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) spoke of the survey that the Minister has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
ordered. I am not opposed to surveys, which can be beneficial, depending on the reasons behind them and the timing. I had always believed that research had to be carried out before principles, priorities, attitudes or Bills were formulated and that prescriptive action was taken on the basis of that research. This time. It is the wrong way round. The Government have decided what they want to do and are now asking people if they agree. We should not rush the Committee stage, because that might affect attitudes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the studies are objective, I should want to take the findings into consideration, as I am honest, decent and straighforward. We should not rush to return the Bill to the Floor of the House without having had time to examine the results of the study. I was heartened when the Minister said that he would try to provide some interim data. I hope that it will explain the methods of selection for the sample. If that sample is biased, we shall be wary of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has knowledge of surveys and scientific methodologies. Will he reflect on the fact that KM) areas are being selected in Scotland, out of which interviews must find 34 parents to question? Does he consider that it to be a representative sample of 800,000 children and about 1.5 million parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have taken advice from friends who are statisticians. The sample size is normaly worked out according to the effect that one is trying to achieve. That means one is trying to achieve a predetermined effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that the survey is not based on normal scientific methods. I have not examined the survey in detail, but I am suspicious of it because there are no control groups. It is just an attitude survey, and it will not necessarily be factually correct. It is the wrog way to approach the matter. My honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central asked me about the methods of surveying, and in the usual model, the investigations are done first, then conclusions are drawn and then action is taken. However, the Government have taken action first, will then decide the conclusions that they want and will then do the investigation. That is what worries me and I want to see the results of the survey. The Minister said that he might give us an interim account, and I should be grateful for that as long as the methodology is explained, because that is important. The Minister has performed a number of such studies and his political technique is to undertake them to try to prove points. That is not unusual in science. The Minister also produces leaflets to explain his ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason why the Committee should have more time and should not have to sit later into the night is that I should like to visit rural areas to consider the impact of the Bill upon them. I am glad that the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is on the Committee. I shall want time to hear what he has to say on that issue. There are many rural schools in the constituency of the honourable Member for Tayside, North and I hope that we shall have to time to discuss them. I am

disappointed that the honouable Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) is not on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the honourable Gentleman realises that my honourable Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) is not on the Committee because he made it clear to the Committee of Selection that he did not wish to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get into sterile arguments about who is or is not on the Committee. That is all water under the bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the honourable Member for Dumfries is not on the Committee because he might have brought us his knowledge about particular problems. Dumfries and Galloway regional council wrote to me saying:
	<br><q><p>"I hope you will be able to find the time to give serious consideration to the requests that are being made by my Education Committee."</p></q>
The letter is relevant to the sittings motions because it states the hope that I shall have the time to consider the requests seriously. I am sorry that the honourable Member for Dumfries cannot respond to that letter from his own area, but I am sure that the honourable Member for Tayside, North will be able to deal with the issue in his usual excellent manner. I do not want the Committee's subsequent debates to be taken up with the sterile questions of mandates and moral duties. However, I do not want to rush into the sittings because I wish to consult with a former Member of Parliament, Michael Ancram. He has put forward an interesting theory called "the Buchanan-Smith/Monro doctrine", which is relevant to the Committee. We shall want to discuss it, but I do not want to do so too early. The trouble with the sittings motion is that we might not have time to discuss that doctrine. It presumably involves the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside and honourable Member for Dumfries and deals with constitutional and moral responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Ancram makes an interesting point with which we must deal, so we need more time to discuss it. He and I contribute to the same newspaper. I do not usually read his articles—mine are rubbish and I do not read them, so there is no sense in reading anyone else's. I glanced through the newspaper recently and saw that he had made some cogent points. He referred to the Buchanan-Smith/Monro doctrine and dealt with mandates. I am opposed to the sittings motion because we need time to discuss that matter. He then said that the third proposition of the doctrine was:
	<br><q><p>"that a deliberate manifesto omission upon which specific electoral assurances were given should not thereafter form the positive substance of legislation … In the case of opt-out, the Government contends that such justification exists in the rapidly changing patterns of educational demand."</p></q>
The doctrine proposes that if something is not contained in a manifesto, there is no reason why it should not be introduced subsequently. I agree, but Michael Ancram's point is that it is not justified for a party to go back on specific assurances made to the electorate.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
That important point is not as sterile as other points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like time to discuss this matter with my co-contributor to this wonderful newspaper, the name of which I shall not mention. I am unhappy about the sittings motion because it will not allow me the time to pursue this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Michael Ancram also said:
	<br><q><p>"In 1987 I gave such assurances"—</p></q>
that the Government would not introduce opt-out legislation—
	<br><q><p>"and undoubtedly held wavering votes by so doing. I happen now to like the concept of opt-out. Nevertheless, had I been re-elected, I would have found it hard not to have sat on my hands along with Alick and Hector last Monday."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Mr. Michael Ancram is no longer a Member of Parliament, will the honourable Gentleman make immediate arrangements to discuss further the details of that important article?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am unhappy with the sittings motion because I want time to discuss this seminal article, which is out of keeping with the paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the honourable Gentleman is not misled by the article, it is important that he examines Michael Ancram's assertion that he held wavering voters.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman may be correct, but that was not Michael Ancram's opinion. He said that voters were swayed, but others believe that their stand held on to voters. We could debate that matter at great length, but it would be inappropriate to discuss it under this sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervened for the sake of accuracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for the sake of accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not rush into this matter but should have more time to discuss the proposals with my constituents. I have received a great deal of mail since my constituents became aware that I was a member of the Committee. Education is of particular interest to many people in Scotland. My constituents do not trust the philosophy behind the Bill. One of my constituents handed me a copy of a letter which he had sent to the Under Secretary of State and to which a civil servant had replied. The letter concerns school placements, about which many people are unhappy. They are worried about the consequences. My constituent complained to the Minister about overcrowding in schools as a result of placements. The reply said:
	<br><q><p>"It is recognised that this may sometimes mean that the space has to be used for close teaching which could otherwise be used for other purposes; but if there were a serious loss of educational quality one would expect that parents would soon prefer to send their children elsewhere."</p></q>
The civil servant, as the Minister's mouthpiece, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
saying, "So what if your education is damaged by this. Stuff it. After your child's education has been damaged, the market will decide that you should take your child elsewhere."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cavalier attitude—that a child's education can be damaged for the sake of market forces—worries my constituents. Although many subscribe to the market forces theory, they do not necessarily do so for education. I am unhappy with the sittings motion because I want more time to discuss that matter with my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other issues with which the Committee should deal and which need more time for consideration. I wish to consult on clause 65, although my basic reaction to it is one of welcome. It deals with the equivalent of a placement request for children with special needs. I am sure that the Minister has been presented with problems on this already; I certainly have. Regulations and legislation throughout the United Kingdom should be opened up and made easier. Many emotions are involved; it is natural that parents wish to do the best for their children. I want to discuss the provision in detail and do not want to be rushed into an early judgment by this sittings motion. As I said, my initial reaction is that clause 65 is good and I expect that Opposition Members will support it, having tried to amend it slightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want time also to discuss clause 62 with those who are involved with technology academies, the Scottish equivalent of city technology colleges. They will be elitist and selective and will drain pupils from other schools at the expense of those schools and of the pupils themselves. Elitism is a philosophy but I am not sure that it is correct. We should aim for excellence, not elitism, in Scottish education. I should like more time to consult on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to consult many people about college councils, which clause 48 will establish. I am unhappy that half the members of those councils will come from employers' organisations. I understand the prejudice that everything must be business oriented, but there will be practical problems. I want to consult business men, and the sittings motion may prevent me from doing that. I want to know what the attendance of business men might be. I am always told that they are the backbone of the nation, that they are busy working night and day and that we should do everything that they do. It now appears that they are suddenly going to find the time to attend the college councils. If they are to make up half the membership of those councils, we must know what their attendance will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider all those matters in this extensive Bill which raises many issues. We shall not oppose everything. I have said already that I like clause 65 and the principles behind it. However, I am bitterly opposed to many other proposals and to the main thrust of the Bill. It is out of sync with the history, nature, sociology and basis of Scottish education, of which I and my honourable Friends have been part. For that reason, I do not support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horn-castle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to volunteer to serve on this Committee and 1 look forward to the contributions of the honourable Member for Glasgow, Mayhill (Mrs. Fyfe). I had the honour to serve with her on the Committee that considered the Local Government Bill which implemented the community charge for England and Wales. The honourable Lady spoke at length and voted on the measures in that legislation, which applied only to England and Wales. I do not argue about that, because she doubtless considers that she is a Member of the United Kingdom Parliament and that, along with the honourable Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), she was fully entitled to take part in the discussions on that legislation, which did not involve her constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not complain about that. The honourable Member for Maryhill spoke well and from knowledge about the Community charge. I welcomed her contributions. I hope that I shall be able to speak with knowledge on education matters. As a member for seven years for a borough council intimately involved with education matters, as a former lecturer in adult education and as a joint author of a pamphlet on education, I can believe that I can contribute to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) that I do not intend to sit on my hands. I am not here merely to do my correspondence. I shall speak with knowledge and passion on an issue about which I feel strongly and on which I have written. Parents all over the United Kingdom should have a chance to have more choice and freedom. The legislation is permissibe and I welcome it. We shall have good debates in the Committee and I hope that honourable Members feel that I have something to contribute. Much of what we have heard so far has been entirely irrelevant. As Members of a United Kingdom Parliament, we all have the opportunity to speak on those matters, and I look forward to doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my honourable Friends in opposing the sittings motion. This is the second stage of a two-stage process. The first was the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. We thought then that that was enabling legislation that would pave the way for opting out. We have been proved correct. We made our opposition known loud and clear when we discussed that legislation. The most important opposition should have been made by the Scottish National party to the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. No Scottish National party Members of Parliament were there and there was no disruption, but that was the start of the opting-out proposals. The Scottish National party has missed the boat by making its protest at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill cannot be stopped by disruption. My honourable Friend for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made the point that we must take the opportunity to speak on behalf of the teaching unions, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the parents and people of Scotland. The teaching unions are an important part of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister's ideology and bigotry coming to the fore at the mention of teachers' unions. I speak as a member of such a union. Those unions have played an honourable part in Scottish education over the past 100 years and have pride of place in the community. It ill behaves the Minister to react in that way when teachers' unions are mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that the Bill can be stopped by argument. I agree with the honourable Member for Moray, that the Bill can be stopped if we tour the towns and villages in Scotland and argue our case. This Committee should meet several times in Scotland. If English Members of Parliament are interested in coming to Westminster to discuss the Bill, let us meet in Edinburgh, Stirling or Glasgow so that we can have meaningful discussions with parents and teachers in Scotland. Perhaps the Minister is frightened—as my honourable Friend for Dundee, East would say— to take the Committee to Scotland. I challenge the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is required to discuss the sittings motion. The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the honourable Member for Dumfried (Sir H. Munro) are against it and they represent 40 per cent. of the Tory Scottish Back Benchers. When the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 was introduced, they were led to think, as were we, that opting was not a possibility. During the passage of that legislation the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> of 30 March 1988 published an extract of a leaked letter from the Prime Minister:
	<br><q><p>"The Prime Minister is glad that your Secretary of State is now going to develop, for inclusion in the next sessions's Scottish Education Bill, a scheme whereby schools in Scotland can opt out of local authority control."</p></q>
That was denied vehemently at the time, but now, almost 12 months later, it is obvious that the Government were playing to that scenario all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> also reported:
	<br><q><p>"The two letters also give an intriguing insight into the manner in which government manipulate Commons business by "planting" tame questions to which a Minister can make a prepoared reply. In this instance the question is to come from former Scottish Office education Minister Mr Allan Stewart."</p></q>
I see that the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is now in his place—I do not suggest that there is a casual relationship—but on 7 December 1988 the honourable Gentleman put down a question for the Secretary of State for Scotland. He asked:
	<br><q><p>"whether he willpublish details of his proposals for allowing aprents to take schools out of local authority control."</p></q>
The presence of the honourable Gentleman could not matched by anyone else, because the Under Secretary replied:
	<br><q><p>"A paper is being issued today."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 7 December 1988; Vol. 143, c.212.]</p></q>

We must discuss the sittings motion at length because the Conservative Party in Scotland is the ideological party. Is has formulated policy without consulting interested bodies. The consultation paper issued on 7 December was followed nine weeks later by the publication of the Bill. It is worrying that parents and interested bodies have not been consulted. Earlier, honourable Members referred to correspondence from the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. That Body was originally in favour of the Bill but it now says:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are only two or three minutes before the end of the sitting, but I hope that that will not detract from the importance of clause 1. Subsections (1) to (4) represent a major departure in Scottish education. Conservative Members have suggested that the Bill is about the extension of parental choice. The theme of our attack is that it is about not parental choice but political power in the Scottish education system. We are also concerned about the decision by a Secretary of State to involve the Government to such an extent in what has traditionally been a locally delivered service. We shall identify the conflict inherent in the clause between local democratic control, accountability and involvement and the extraordinary powers being taken by a Secretary of State. There has been leadership and direction from the Scottish Office, which is perfectly acceptable, but there has never been such a draconian attempt to take over the running of particular schools under the guise of giving parents extra choice.

Another major theme in our attack is that of the exploitation of parents by the Government. For 10 years, the Government have employed a strategy of undermining local authority state provision.
