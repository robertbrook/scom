	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[continuation from col. 932]</p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point that the Government's interest in far-Right groups is not reflected in their interest in education. It is essential to highlight the role of education authorities and the importance of finance. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) showed the importance of budgeting procedure and the possibility that it could prove difficult to an opted-out school. That relates both to the budgeting process and to equity in terms of what a self-governing school might need as a per capita amount, especially for the complex arrangements for centrally provided services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should reflect on the interventions from Conservative Back-Bench Members. It was suggested that an opted-out school might decide to purchase services from an education authority or obtain them from elsewhere. Even if the Government decided to ignore education authorities and take advice from far-Right groups, which have no legitimacy in Scotland, it is crucial that the matter is taken seriously. It will have implications for the children in opted-out schools and the overall financial allocation and the quality of services provided by education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We highlighted how some members of the Government seem to be the prisoners of the new Right. There is enormous disquiet in Scotland and elsewhere about the increasing and expanding network of organisations on the far Right which undemocratically influence Government policy for the provision of education. I shall put on record another statement from the ACE report entitled "Privatisation by Stealth: The New Right Education Policy". Talking about the pace of reform, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The right wing groups are all concerned about the pace of reform. Sexton"—</p></blockquote>
to whom we referred earlier—
	<br><blockquote><p>"believes the 'gradualism' is the key to success. A policy of privatisation by stealth is less likely to frighten the public or the professionals. The 1988 Education Reform Act begins to lay the ground for privatisation particularly through its provision for budget delegation and formula-funding. Whilst 'opting-out' has attracted a great deal of attention it is LMS, and in particular financial delegation, which will lead eventually to privatisation, if the Right have their way. However, further legislation, during a 'fourth term' would be needed to formalise the 'independent' status of the self-managed LEA schools and force most of them into the
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
private sector proper. At the same time, legislation would provide for the rewriting of teachers' contracts, since as new independent schools they would be reformed as quite different legal entities from their LEA predecessors. That is, as charitable trusts run by their governors, and with teachers contracted on an individual basis. This would also be the time to legislate to abolish teachers' national salary scales, and the effect would be to subject teachers' effectiveness to the rigours of the market."</p></blockquote>
That meets with the approval of certain Conservative Members, especially the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that that is an agenda for the fourth term. It would obviously have to meet with the approval of the electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To meet with the approval of the electorate in Scotland would require a quantum leap. The Conservative party's programme has been consistently rejected and, given the Government's behaviour on education and other issues, that is unlikely to change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the surprising remark of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) that the Conservative party would have to gain the support of the electorate? Is the hon. Gentleman unaware that other policies have been imposed on Scotland despite the direct and unequivocal opposition of the Scottish electorate, so why should that stop them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Especially the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. As the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes is on autopilot, unconcerned with what is happening in the real world, he may also be unaware of the realities of Scottish politics and the wishes of the Scottish electorate. That has not constrained the activities of Conservative Members in Committee and I am sure that they do not occupy their minds with the desires and needs of the Scottish people. Only their ideology and extremism filters through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we are asking is for the Government to take education authorities seriously. That is not a major issue; it is not even of great import beyond Scottish education authorities, parents and pupils. Why do we still have to urge the Government to accept suggestions and take on board ideas which most normal, sane Governments throughout Europe would absorb into their legislation so that at least it looked as though concessions were being made to those who provide the service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks, especially the idea of a hidden agenda as a prelude to privatisation and the suggestion that local management and delegation of financial responsibility to schools are part of a gradualist plot leading to privatisation. Are we to assume that the hon. Member for Fife, Central believes that Strathclyde is part of that plot, given its recent announcements about delegating budgetary responsibility to school level? Even the Labour party in Strathclyde—supported by the efforts of the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)—realises that people want more control over their affairs. The hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that that view commands support across the political divide and join in, as Strathclyde has done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the Minister a copy of the report and I hoped that he would have read it by now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is selective in what he remembers and what he forgets. Strathclyde regional council deals with half the Scottish population and an enormous number of schools, including further education colleges. Its bold and imaginative step forward combines conceptual thinking and practical developments and is light years away from anything that the Government have proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the Strathclyde initiative is that it seeks to protect and develop the comprehensive system, not destroy it. The analogy must be made with the Government strategy for the Health Service—putting patients first, putting parents first. Self-governing schools are like self-governing hospitals. No one in Scotland is still fooled that this opting-out initiative or the original concept behind school boards have anything to do with real parental involvement. It was part of the hidden agenda. That is why it is so important that the matter is discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the sense of unreality in Scotland about opting out. It is regarded as a joke. It is not possible to have a serious discussion about it. But if one has a debate about the real agenda behind the Government's intentions it starts to ring bells in the minds of parents, educationists and others. The Strathclyde report and others that have been mentioned are vital in that they alert Scottish people to what this is all about. Strathclyde is on the record as having taken a bold and imaginative step forward. The crucial distinction between Strathclyde's initiative and the political knockabout by the hard Right on this Committee was that Strathclyde was concerned about a decentralised structure to take it into the year 2000 which would cope with the problems confronting it. What did the Government pick on? Two or three comments made by the leader of the council about school boards and, hey presto, what the papers say becomes the agenda item for the Government Benches. There is an absolute poverty of fact and argument. They know that 400 miles from Scotland they can indulge in silly games where no one sees them and no one really cares but they can score political points. That is fine. That is the nature of the parliamentary game. We accept that as parliamentarians. But at the end of the day it is crucial that the people of Strathclyde benefit from the initiative in the report—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] The Government's schoolboy response—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not insult schoolboys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to schoolboys the world over. The Inlogov report brings us back to funding. Will the Government tell Councillor Gray in Strathclyde that they welcome his initiative? Will they ask him what finances he needs to implement such a structure, especially if it is complicated by some schools considering opting out? We come back to the financial integrity and credibility of education, whether it be private, quasi-private or public. That is why my hon. Friends have been right to say that the Government are not taking the clause seriously. The Scottish Office will certainly want to draw up regulations, as has been done in England. We hope that it will consult experts who know what they are talking about. We also hope that the Government will take it on board that regardless of whether a school opts out our ultimate concern is for parents within the education authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
sector and within any school that decides to opt out. That is why we have taken the opportunity to highlight the important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that people who have the ultimate contempt for those who work in local government should be concerned about the budgeting procedures and the work that is done within a local authority. But at present COSLA and the education authorities regard the financial structure that has been established for the opting-out provision as completely unworkable. It will be extraordinarily difficult in practice and in terms of the evenhandedness with which the debate started. We are discussing recurrent grant; in local government parlance that is revenue. What worries local government is that because the Government are on autopilot with no regard for the sensitivities or the realities in Scottish education they might benefit opted-out schools but severely punish the comprehensive sector. Our clause stand part debate has been entirely correct. The Government may or may not respond to the points made by my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. There are few occasions when the Government respond positively to the real difficulties facing Scottish education. Unless they do so and accept the seriousness of our argument, they will be seen as merely playing political football with education authority finance. That would not surprise Opposition Members, but people are worried about the fundamental impact that self-governing schools will have on Scotland. For obvious reasons, we shall vote against clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.

I made some constructive points, and I wish to know his response to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no one seeks to speak, I must put the Question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Perhaps the Minister did not catch all our points. Would it be possible for me to refresh the Minister's memory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very very important clause. I can see the anticipation in the eyes of Conservative Members as they wait to see what I make of this detailed clause. I shall be struggling, but I shall do my best— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am getting many helpful contributions from the Conservative Benches. Perhaps if I sit down someone will intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amoss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be drinking it all in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he wishes to drink in every word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been drinking all night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is quite wrong. I have some comments for the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos), whose name spelt backwards is "Soma" which means of body but no soul, which is an interesting concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have just debated an important clause, which goes to the heart of the Bill. It relates to funding and clawback and gives the Secretary of State great powers. We shall soon discuss another very important clause which relates to the change in a school's characteristics to become selective and the methods by which those characteristics may be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might ask why we are discussing clause 27. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."] It is our nature and our duty to examine every word in the clause. I am sure that Conservative Members would not wish us to rush. Clause 27 is caught between two important clauses, but I am sure that it is not on everyone's lips. I am sure that the man on the Clapham bus is not talking about it, let alone the woman on the Kirkie bus in my constituency or the person on the Ullapool to Stornoway ferry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Budapest bus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the Budapest bus and whether the person on it asked the Minister about clause 27 but he probably did not. I see the hon. Member for Hexham—there is nothing for the hon. Gentleman to worry about in what I am going to say so he can relax —said to 	<i>Hospital Doctor,</i> which is a rag that I read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am still getting many more letters from constituents about health than any other issue."</p></blockquote>
I was wondering whether he received any letters about clause 27 or about the Bill as a whole. His constituents will be interested to know that while he is receiving so many letters about the Health Service and saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My experience is typical of other Members of Parliament. We are all feeling the pressure—not just letters but also delegations",</p></blockquote>
is spending his time discussing clause 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
Although the clause is important, it will not be on everyone's lips. It will not be discussed on the streets of Glasgow tonight, in the parks of Edinburgh tomorrow, or in the harbours of Dundee the day after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading through the verbiage, I understand that the clause will apply the current position of pupils in one education authority, who are being educated in another, to self-governing schools. As such, it does nothing more than retain the status quo and apply it generally to those schools. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) is not here because he would have made great play of the words in the clause. It takes three subsections merely to say that if a self-governing school is in a different education authority, arrangements will have to be made to pay for that. I am sure that such drafting is in the nature of lawyers' language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) refers to the provision of benefits or services. As the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) knows, many children will have to move from one authority to another for special education needs and I understand the inclusion of the provision. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The board of management of a self-governing school shall provide the education authority … with such information".</p></blockquote>
I am surprised that the Minister did not include the phrase "reasonable information".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the important points that I wish to raise later is the problem of the information that self-governing schools must supply to the education authority, which will enable the authority to claim back the equivalent amount for the pupils from another education authority area whom it teaches. How can we know that the self-governing school, being a very small body, will be able to supply such detailed information to the education authority to enable it to claim back the relevant amount from its sister authority? We cannot know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Self-governing schools will not necessarily have such expertise. To get round that problem, they could co-opt on to their boards of management a couple of accountants, or abuse taxpayers' money by using the education authority's services. They could try surreptitiously to get round that problem in many ways, but I do not suggest that they would seek to mislead any education authority. I am surprised that the Minister has not included the concept of "reasonable" in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my devastating analysis of this important clause by putting to the Minister a hypothetical case. I do not envisage the case arising, but it analyses a principle and one must examine the principles behind the clause to try to get right the issues involved. In a self-governing school, if the majority of patients—[HON. MEMBERS: "Patients?"] Pupils. One never knows with some self-governing schools. If the majority of pupils came from outside the education authority in which the school was sited and the number of pupils from the education authority was so small that the school was no longer viable and so was closed, what would happen to the money that was taken from the education authority to support that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>939</span>
Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) dealt with precisely such a case. A school in the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastwood attracted many pupils from outwith its area. The Minister must tackle that serious problem when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles suggests that the Minister will not respond to the debate. I cannot believe that. I am sure that he will be only too pleased to continue the debate. I hope that he understands my argument. I shall take it to its ultimate conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If every pupil in a school came from outside the education authority area, what would the financial arrangements be for items such as building and for funding within the education authority area? If only a handful of pupils came from the education authority area and the authority decided that the school was no longer viable and wished to close it, would the authority be under any obligation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be no capital equivalents or recurrent grant equivalents for the education authority, yet because of pupils from outside, a school might have to be maintained. What will the financial arrangements be and who will pay for the school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat our debate on the previous clause, but the same arguments apply now. The arrangements look simple and the clause appears to be an innocuous, technical provision, yet it opens a can of worms and a hornets' nest—I cannot think of another description along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A pit of snakes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly. The clause reopens several financial issues that must be debated. There is potential for conflict among education authorities about self-governing schools. I hope that the Minister will respond and that we shall not pass glibly over an apparently technical clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues involved are vital. My other hon. Friends wish to speak and I hope that the Minister will respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that the clause is much more difficult to understand than it appears at first glance. I have read it three times and I still do not know fully what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, subsection (1) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"recovery for provision for education of pupils belonging to, or having connection with, the area of another authority".</p></blockquote>
Surely a pupil at a school in one area could belong to the area of a second local authority and have connection with the area of a third education authority. That is not impossible. Some parents like to travel widely round the country. A child might be brought up by grandparents or by the sister of its natural parents. Families have all sorts of arrangements for the accommodation and upbringing of their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that sooner or later the Minister will explain what the clause means. I hope that he will be more willing to do so than he was on clause 26, which involved a great issue of principle. Clause 27 deals merely with administrative arrangements, so I hope that the Minister will enlighten us about what it can mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>940</span>
A pupil could attend a school in Strathclyde, belong to Tayside and have connections with Central. It would be difficult to know who was supposed to report to whom and where to seek information. There would be great complexities. People would struggle to keep within the letter of the law and to avoid falling foul of the regulations. I admit that I have cited a rather weird example, but it could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision for education includes a reference to provision of any benefits or services for which provision is made by or under any enactment relating to education."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that the Government are not interested in provision that is not covered by
	<br><blockquote><p>"any enactment relating to education."?</p></blockquote>
I am not sure what such provision is. The clause clearly says that it deals only with provision
	<br><blockquote><p>"made by or under any enactment relating to education."</p></blockquote>
so the Government are not concerned with provision under enactments that do not relate to education or with provision that is not made under any enactments because there is no law on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need clarity. Perhaps the Minister will make it easier for us by explaining what enactments would and would not relate to education and what provision would come under no enactment at all. Then we might have a clearer idea of what the clause is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) is equally obscure. It refers to information required about pupils' attendance at school, but it does not make it clear what type of information is needed. The information required might be as simple as asking when a pupil started attending school, or on what date he left. It might relate to provisions given to the pupil by virtue of a service delivered by a neighbouring education authority, but the exact requirement is not made clear. We must be given a clearer idea of what the clause means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said that the clause opens up all sorts of strange possibilities. Law abiding citizens, schools and local authorities will be faced with an Act of Parliament and not know how to comply with the legislation because they cannot understand it. They will be terrified of falling foul of the law, and will not know what penalties will be imposed if they do not comply with it. People will not know whether they will end up paying double poll tax, go to gaol or pay a fine. To obey the law, people must understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we attempt to introduce coherent and comprehensible law for the benefit of citizens, it is certainly the duty of all members of the Committee, not only Opposition Members, to make sure that they understand it. I am sure that hon. Members other than Opposition Members find the clause difficult to understand. The notes on clauses are no help, which is no surprise because that is usually the case. They stick to the major areas of principle in the Bill but do not explain the important technical details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have struggled to understand the Bill and have been successful in many different areas of knowledge, but clause 27 is stumping us. From the expression on Conservative Members' faces, I have a funny feeling that they are also none the wiser. It will be extremely irresponsible of us to pass a clause without making sure that we understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>941</span>
I hope that the Minister will clarify the position for the benefit of us all. I also hope that Conservative Back-Bench Members share our sense of responsibility and will ensure that they, too, understand the clause. I cannot see us finishing our debate on the clause in the time that one might otherwise hope because ti may take quite a while for all hon. Members to be sure that they understand the ramifications of all three subsections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain clearly, for the benefit of us all, what the clause means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) made a valuable contribution by giving the Committee a timely warning that it is inadvisable to allow any clause to slip through on the assumption that it is only a technical clause that will not affect anyone in Scotland. The clause contains serious flaws and my hon. Friend was correct to highlight one that I had missed in subsection (1), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"pupils belonging to, or having connection with, the area of another authority".</p></blockquote>
It is beholden on the Minister to explain what is meant by "having connection with". Either a person belongs to a place or he does not. I always thought that I belonged to Dundee and Tayside. Perhaps I should now adjust my beliefs and consider whether I am only connected with Tayside and belong to somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a native of Springburn, where I was born many years ago. I was brought up in Springburn and Glasgow, but does that mean that if my son went to school in Fife, Fife would ask Strathclyde to pay the money for my son to go to school in Fife, or would Tayside, where I live, be asked for the money? I do not know what is meant by subsection (1) and the Minister will have to explain it to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another possibility on which my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill did not touch. When a mother and father are divorced and live in two different education authority areas, their child may spend half the week with one parent and the remaining half with the other. That child may be deemed to belong to one parent and one education authority area, but deemed to have connections with the other parent and the other education authority area. When the education authority of the school that the child attends has to claim back the money, which education authority area does it claim from? Does it go to the mother's education authority area where the child is deemed to belong, or the father's education authority area where the child is deemed only to have a connection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important definition. The Minister must explain the difference between belonging to, and having connections with, education authority areas. Many pupils attending a self-governing school in one education authority area may belong to, and have connections with, a number of education authority areas elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the poll tax, a person is supposed to pay tax for the area that he belongs to, but if he is deemed to have connections with another area by having another property there, he has to pay the poll tax twice. There could be similar implications for an education authority trying to claim back money from the other education authority areas to which pupils in its schools belong or with which they have connections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a most distressing situation. I hope that the Minister will explain the phrase to the Committee, because from where I am sitting, it is clear that Conservative Members have no idea what "having connection with" means. They are quite happy to let it slip through because
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
it does not matter to them. They are quite happy to let anything slip through because the legislation applies only to Scotland and will not affect the majority of constituencies represented on the Committee's Conservative Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) waving to me. I have not forgotten the hon. Gentleman —indeed, it is hard to forget him. He will be affected by the legislation, but he does not care because he is so far to the Right that nothing really matters to him. He owned up this morning to being a member of the No Turning Back group and having other extreme Right-wing connections. I am sure that his constituents will be very interested to hear him say so publicly and will no doubt hold him to account for that at the next general election. I certainly hope so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) waving something at me. He obviously thinks that I have super powers and can read press releases from about 25 yards away, but it is beyond me to read that from the other side of the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was waving a press release showing how proud I am to be a member of the No Turning Back group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious why the hon. Member for Eastwood used to hold office in Scotland and no longer does so. That is why he takes pride in such extreme Right-wing policies. I am sure that the fate that awaited the hon. Gentleman will also await the Minister once it becomes clear to the Conservative party that those politics are not welcome in Scotland. Those who pursue them are thrown to the outer extremities of influence in the parliamentary Conservative party, certainly in the context of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the background to the clause is that the education authority in whose area a pupil in a self-governing school is taught is financially liable for the cost of that pupil's education, even when the pupil comes from another area. That means that the education authority will be liable for the cost of teachers, books, equipment, ancillary staff, support services, new buildings and all the other costs associated with providing incoming pupils with an education. Clause 27(2) describes the costs as
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision of any benefits or services for which provision is made by or under any enactment relating to education."</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly wide definition of the kind of costs for which an education authority will be liable under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 27 allows the Secretary of State to pay the self-governing schools a sum equivalent to the cost of making such a provision. The clause then allows the Secretary of State to recover that sum from the education authority in whose area the school is located. It is then left to the education authority to recover an equivalent sum from the education authority area from where the pupil originates. I think that that is what the clause means, although 1 am less sure now that my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill has directed my attention to the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or having connection with, the area of another authority".</p></blockquote>
Let us compare that to the other clauses. Clause 25 allows the Secretary of State to make annual recurrent grants to self-governing schools. The level of those grants is entirely up to him. Clause 26 then allows the Secretary of State to recover those grants from the education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
authority. Again, it is entirely up to the Secretary of State to decide how much he recovers. There need be no connection between the amount of the grant and the amount recovered from the education authority. We have only the Minister's word on that; there is no guarantee in the Bill that the two will equate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 27 is different. For example, subsection (3) says that the education authority must claim
	<br><blockquote><p>"any amount in respect of any such pupil from another authority under, or by virtue of, the said section 23."</p></blockquote>
That is section 23 of the 1980 Act, which allows an authority to provide school education and other services for pupils from some other education authority area, and to recover contributions in respect of such provision from that authority. The amount of those contributions is fixed by agreement between the two authorities or by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas self-governing school grants and the amount that an education authority will have deducted from it will be decided by the Secretary of State for Scotland, an education authority can recover from a sister authority only contributions in respect of provision made by that authority. What is meant by a "contribution"? The Bill does not assure us that it will be a sum equivalent to the cost of teaching the pupils from that education authority area. The hon. Member for Eastwood nods in agreement. Now that I know that he agrees with me, it is beginning to click: the education authority will be unable to claim back from its sister authority the equivalent cost of teaching its pupils; it can get only a contribution from that authority —a guess, perhaps, of how much it should contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As there is no way in which the Government, the self-governing school or the education authority can monitor exactly how much it costs to teach children from other areas, there is no guarantee that they can recover those costs. Education authorities that take in pupils from other areas must do so on the basis that they will lose money by so doing. That important distinction has emerged in the course of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why this ambivalence? As the Secretary of State for Scotland decides everything else, why is it left to the education authorities to try to reach agreement in this case? I assume that only if they fail to agree does the decision go to the Secretary of State. Why does the Bill make a difference in these circumstances? Moreover, how will the Secretary of State decide in favour of one education authority against another? If education authorities fail to agree, what are the criteria and premises on which the Secretary of State will intervene and decide which side to favour? I look forward to the Minister's replies to those interesting questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses for subsection (2) describe the extent of the provision that may be involved. They say that the provision could include
	<br><blockquote><p>"benefits or services being provided by the authority directly for pupils at the self-governing school in addition to what is recovered by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Why is it in addition to what is recovered by the Secretary of State? I thought that the Secretary of State's original calculation of the amount to be recovered under clause 26 included the cost of centrally provided services to the school. I assumed that the Minister had conceded that in earlier debates. He agreed that the Secretary of State's
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
original calculation included an estimate of the cost of such services. Perhaps I was wrong and the Minister will clarify the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) refers us to clause 24 and schedule 6, which deal with the provision of transport, school clothing and matters of the pupils' health and cleanliness, including dental and medical check-ups. Under those provisions, the education authority is obliged not to discriminate between self-governing schools and those under its own control. Therefore, why is it that the Minister will devolve to the boards of management of self-governing schools authority and control over some centrally provided services, and has calculated for that in clauses 25, 26 and 27, when he will not do that for others? Why are the costs of transport, school clothing, dental and medical check-ups for pupils outside education authority control a matter to be decided by the education authority alone, whereas boards of management will take decisions about all other centrally provided services? Will the Minister explain the reason for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will also refer to the implications involved. Will boards of management have the expertise and the necessary financial assistance to make it possible for them to provide the figures that education authorities need to enable them to exercise their powers, or will the authorities have to guess at the figures involved? The Minister cannot expect an education authority to welcome pupils into the schools in its areas if that will cost it money. One education authority will lose out, and another will gain from the arrangements. The clause will allow such an unwise and unhealthy system to develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has just made an important point about the responsibility of the boards of management of self-governing schools. Parents will take on a major responsibility and they will naturally be interested in the educational input into the school. However, they will also have to spend time on the bureaucratic niceties of working out the details of the information—of which we do not yet know the details— that they will have to provide. Such tasks may be well down their list of priorities because, in their free time, they will be concentrating on running the school. How do we overcome that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a worthy point. The boards of management will come into being for the first time in, possibly, 1990. The Minister has suggested that is what he wishes to see happen. The board will consist of parents and teachers who have never been involved in educational administration. They will suddenly be given the power to opt out of buying services from the education authority, and to go into the private sector to bring in professional people who also have never been involved in educational administration. Such raw, inexperienced and, perhaps even naive, people will be in charge of running a self-governing school. They will have to pull out of a hat the exact figures that education authorities need to enable them to claim back from other education authorities the cost of educating children from their areas. That is a major problem, but the Minister has so fansaid nothing. I hope that he will not do what he did in the previous clause stand part debate and say nothing. He made no contribution. He did not answer the valid points raised by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the question of Strathclyde was raised one of our constant themes has been the commitment of Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>
Members to the report from Inlogov, which stressed that there was lack of strategic management in Strathclyde education. If the Bill is enacted, the strategic management of all Scottish education will be undermined. Schools will be left to go their own way and to do their own thing. The report from Inlogov said that there was a
	<br><blockquote><p>"a confused and over elaborate bureaucracy"</p></blockquote>
in schools in Strathclyde. If ever there was an excuse for a confused and over elaborate bureaucracy, it is clauses 27 and 26, which try to monitor payments and determine who owes who, or which pupils come from, or are connected with, which area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are serious matters, yet Conservative Members sit in silence. They do not care whether education in Scotland collapses in chaos, but we do. We want to make sure that bureaucracy is kept to a minimum, and that maximum resources are allocated to teaching children in schools. That is why clause 27 is particularly important to the people in Scotland, but Conservative Members do not even want to discuss it. They want to sit silently and put it through on the nod. They complain when Opposition Members contribute to the debate and ask the Minister questions. It is deplorable that the debate should be conducted in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish on this point. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh no."] Obviously Conservative Members have a strategic plan that I have not cottoned on to; that is why they want me to continue speaking. The document "Save our Schools" from the No Turning Back group of Conservative Members, many of whom are members of the Committee, has become the centrepiece of this debate. The document defends the right of parents to decide to opt out from education authority control, at whatever level. Two years ago, the Minister said that if the parents of only 28 children wanted to opt out of education authority control, they should be allowed to do so. That means that if a group of disaffected parents want to go their own way, the Minister will allow them to set up their own school in whatever buildings happen to be available. Over the years, they can build up the school from 28 children to a reasonably sized school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very different from the provision of the Education Reform Act 1988, which do not allow schools with fewer than 300 pupils to opt out of education authority control. Yet, in Scotland, Conservative Members want numbers as low as 28 to be allowed to opt out and to go their own way. Imagine the confusion if hundreds of groups of pupils, 28 strong, set up their own schools all over Scotland and did their own thing in competition with each other. No one would know what happened to the resources; no one could monitor them to know whether they reach those who need them. Any group that wished to break away could do so. At one stage, the hon. Member for Eastwood conceded that if a group of parents who believe in witchcraft want to go their own way, that will be up to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to clause 27. I do not understand how I can read column 381 at the same time. I have many gifts, such as voting in two Committee Rooms at the same time, but I cannot speak to a clause and read from the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of a previous sitting at the same time. However, when there is a quiet moment—there has no been one yet—I shall try to read column 381 and interpret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to clause 27 and finish my speech. The essence of the case is that the provisions of the Bill and the Minister's intentions, as we interpret them from the published documents to which he has lent his name, show us that it will be possible in the Scottish education system for small groups of parents who may have as few as 28 children to opt out of education authority control and go their own way. That is our worry about clause 27. If that happens, and there is a proliferation of small cliques opening up everywhere and the disintegration of the central coherence of Scottish education, a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare will follow and make clause 27 inoperable. I have just been handed 	<i>Hansard,</i> and shown column 381 but I will be out of order, Mr. Martin, if I read it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me are the contradictory arguments that we have heard from the Minister. Even the Secretary of State for Scotland, who has graced the Committee with his presence tonight—no doubt his mistress has finished with him for the day so he is allowed to come here, and we are glad to see him—was so moved that he intervened when we
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>
last discussed these matters, such was the Government's attitude to the Strathclyde report which was prepared by Inlogov. The report warned against precisely the sort of bureaucratic nightmare that clause 27 will lead to. It stated that Strathclyde's education service suffered from
	<br><blockquote><p>"a confused and over-elaborate bureaucracy".</p></blockquote>
How much worse will that bureaucracy become if the clause is added to the Bill, and there is a proliferation of schools making claims to be funded from this and that authority or from the Government? A massive machinery will be needed to monitor where expenditure is taking place and who should billed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde report also stated that the education service
	<br><blockquote><p>"suffered from an absence of strategic management".</p></blockquote>
What sort of strategic management will there be if, as a result of the clause being enacted, any small group can break away from education authority provision, occupy any available building and attract funding from whatever source is available? That cannot help Scottish education. I am sure that the Secretary of State for Scotland would have no part of that scenario, nor would he allow his name to be added to the infamous document "Save Our Schools" from the No Turning Back group to which the Minister who has responsibility for education lent his name. The ex-Minister responsible for education, the hon. Member for Eastwood, lent his name to it retrospectively after reading it. It is interesting that the Secretary of State for Scotland did not do so; in fact, he continued to distance himself from it. That gives me little comfort, however, because I suspect that the Secretary of State for Scotland is merely the window dressing in an attempt to put a respectable face on the Right-wing fanaticism behind the window in the form of the Minister. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde report warned about a lack of response to local needs. That has happened, because we are not responding to local needs if we allow the disintegration of the local education fabric, and allow people to break away and set up their own small schools, just as the dissenters who went to America originally did. They hived off into small groups and broke away from the original settlements. They set up on their own and went to war, with the result that the coherence of religion fell apart, and the new America had many problems afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the way to manage education in Scotland. Resources are limited and are becoming ever more so, given the Government's economic management. It will become difficult to spend money on education through the public sector because of the economic problems of the trade deficit, and for other reasons. When resources are short, it behoves the Government to ensure that resources are allocated where they are needed most and not to allocate them to small groups of parents who happen to take up their humph to go away set up their own school in a room somewhere, expecting money to follow them automatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not interested in delivering a coherent education system that is locally accountable to the communities that it serves. He wants to break up the existing local network. That is what he has always been about, as "Save our Schools" shows. He has not said that he had anything to do with the document or that he has

	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>

In view of the hon. Gentleman's declared hostility to all things English—except for voting on English matters in Committee Room 9—I am surprised that he is so enthusiastic about certain sections of the report from the Institute of Local Government Studies prepared for Strathclyde university. Is he aware that that organisation is based not a million miles from my constituency in Birmingham?

Perhaps that is why they came north to Scotland to a more suitable political climate.

If the Bill is allowed to go through, we are in danger of creating in Scotland the educational equivalent of Lebanon, where factionism is everywhere, groups fight against other groups and there is no coherence and no proper education provision. The Under-Secretary has begun to fragment educational provision. The Secretary of State for Scotland laughs but, he would be well advised to read the pamphlet "Save our Schools" and consider what it implies. That shows what the Under-Secretary is about, but what is the Secretary of State for Scotland about? Does he share that perspective and the view that education in Scotland should be wrecked, disintegrated and replaced by a new system that follows the prejudices of whatever groups want to break away and form their own small elitist schools? That is what clause 27, like every other clause in the Bill, is about, and none of them should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am quite surprised at the number of contributions that there have been on clause 27, I thought that as it was such a small clause, I might be left to speak on it alone, but I am happy to say that my hon. Friends have all taken part in the debate and have performed their proper duties as members of the Committee, to scrutinise each clause as it goes through. They have made many important points. Lest the Minister responds as he did on clause 26, I remind him that many of the points that have been made are of genuine interest, particularly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). She drew attention to the odd phrase "having connection with", to describe the status of pupils in relation to various education authorities. The implication is that "having connection with" is distinct from "belonging to" and education authority. All Opposition Members are puzzled about the meaning of that phrase and about why it is necessary to include it as an alternative to the simple "belonging to", which would seem to be sufficiently clear cut and relevant to the purposes of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has also been made about how education is defined in the clause. Education need not necessarily mean only the core items of education at a school's curriculum to improve the diversity of study. It could mean day trips for pupils. If it means that wide diversity of options, that would have considerable implications for the clause and thus for the type of administration that will be necessary to ensure that it operates properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said that schools such as those in my constituency could have small numbers of pupils, and asking them to go through this administrative and ledger-keeping hoop-la is asking rather a lot. It is rather more than was asked of the Secretary of State for Scotland in the previous clause, where he was allowed to make wild guesses and estimates. Here it seems that schools will be required to make precise estimates of the cost of supplying education to a pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it interesting that the notes on clauses say that according to section 23 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, the amount of contributions judged to be owing by one authority to another:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is fixed by agreement between the two authorities or by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Clause 27 accepts that matters can be fixed by mutual agreement despite the fact that one party owes another a sum of money. The Minister rejected an earlier amendment in which we asked him to come to an agreement with education authorities. He argued that to require the Secretary of State to do that would give education authorities the ability to exercise a veto over the Secretary of State. Where has the Minister's argument
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
gone? In this clause, two authorities are expected to agree on the amount owing, but there is no suggestion that one authority could exercise a veto over the other, although it would be in its interest to be as difficult and reluctant as possible. The requirement that the amount has to be fixed by agreement would fall into the lap of the authority that had to come up with the money. Nevertheless, the Minister thinks that reason can prevail and that the two authorities will act constructively and not elevate self-interest above the requirements of reason. We must, therefore, assume that the Minister rejected the notion of mutual agreement between the education authority and the Secretary of State because he feared that the Secretary of State would not be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 27(3) requires the board of management of self-governing schools to provide education authorities with the necessary information to estimate amounts owing to it. The word "shall" is used instead of "may". There is a selective use of those two words throughout the Bill. When an education authority or any other body is required to do something, the word "shall" is used, but when the Secretary of State is required to do something, the word "may" is always used. That revealing choice of words shows how the bounds of the Secretary of State's discretion and freedom to act are expanded over and above those of other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "shall" is used in clause 26(3). The board of management is required to provide the education authority with information. What is the Government's view of their own ability to provide statistical material? They expect boards of management to provide all the necessary data to make financial judgments, but the same requirement is not placed on them. They are not required to provide all the data and then make an accurate assessment of how much money they owe local authorities for recurrent grants. They have the option of getting the figures wrong or even failing to add those up. They have the option of looking at the sums, finding them too difficult, and then making a wild stab at them. The board of management cannot say that the sums are too difficult, or that it is hard to trace where every penny has gone in the complex workings of a school. It can make no excuses but must provide the data and information that will allow a financial assessment to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, we regard the clause with jaundiced eyes. When the Minister replies, we hope that he will answer our questions on clause 26, too. It would be a disgrace if we allowed those clauses to go through without their being justified. The Government have a superior majority and it may be that they are hiding their intentions and agenda beneath the rhetoric of parent power. The least that they can do is to scrape up an argument for those feeble clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised that the clause has provoked such interest from the Opposition. It is a technical provision and applies the same financial arrangements to self-governing schools for the recovery of costs of pupils from another education authority as now apply between education authorities under section 23 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. That process has operated for the past eight years and has not provoked much interest or controversy, so we are applying it to self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
I assure Opposition Members that all their fears and anxieties about a hidden agenda are a little removed from the substance of the clause and are without foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) asked for the definition of "education". I know that it has been defined as a drawing out, which is appropriate in the context of our debate. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked what was meant by the phrase "enactment relating to education." That is fairly obvious. It means Acts on education, such as the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister did not hear me properly. I did not ask what was meant by the phrase "enactment relating to education." I asked whether there were relevant enactments that did not relate to education and whether there was a provision that did not relate to any enactment whatever, because we did not believe that the clause was clear about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not every enactment about education appears in an education Act. The School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 is an example of that. The hon. Member for Maryhill also asked about penalties. Failure to apply the terms of the clause would be a breach of the statutory duty, and section 70 of the 1980 Act provides the Secretary of State with remedies. Clause 7(7) of the Bill applies section 70 to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just revealed some serious news. If a school board fails to comply, it will be in breach of an Act of Parliament, which is what we suspected. It is all very well to say that there are penalties, but the Minister must spell out the penalties that may be faced by parents who contemplate running those schools. It is not sufficient to say vaguely that there are penalties; people are entitled to know what they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained that failure to comply with the clause would be a breach of statutory duty. Section 70 of the 1980 Act provides the Secretary of State with remedies and clause 7(7) of the Bill applies section 70 of that Act to the Bill. The hon. Lady will find the information that she is requesting in section 70 of the 1980 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked about the information to be supplied by self-governing schools under clause 27(3). The information will normally consist of the names and addresses of the pupils attending a self-governing school who live outwith the education authority's area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked me the meaning of
	<br><blockquote><p>"pupils belonging to, or having connection with, the area of another authority".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) also asked that. Those words are simply a description of the effect of section 23 of the 1980 Act, which sets out how the area to which a pupil belongs will be determined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister believes that as the provision relates to previous legislation, there is nothing to worry about. But he cannot expect all the members of the Committee to take the time to look back at previous legislation. The fact that it is already in existence matters not a jot because people have happily elected local authorities, paid for those services and left others to attend to them. But they are now expected to take charge of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
education in opted-out schools. It is important that everyone understands the matter and it is not helpful for the Minister simply to refer to previous legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I do the hon. Lady an injustice. I expected her to be familiar with the 1980 Act before she came to a Committee concerned with education legislation. I am not here to do the hon. Lady's homework. I assume that she has a copy of the 1980 Act because she would find it very difficult to understand and take part in our proceedings without it. On page 20, section 23, which I shall not read because I do not want my speech to rival that of the hon. Member for Western Isles, runs to two pages and contains the information that the hon. Lady requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly puzzled that the hon. Lady says that there should be anxiety about the matter. The 1980 Act has worked effectively and I cannot see any difficulty arising from that. If she does not have the 1980 Act—that is apparent—I understand why she may be in difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not happen to have the 1980 Act with me. I do not always bring it into the Committee, but I have read it. Is the Minister confident that all his Back-Benchers have taken the trouble to read, and understand, it?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends expected us to have covered this ground by 12 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) has not been here all day to hear the contributions made by me and my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, but I understand that the hon. Lady was ill and we should not hold that against her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will appreciate that there are many times when we do not understand the specific point of a clause. Perhaps he can help us in this instance by citing an example of a connection of a pupil with a local education authority under the Bill, other than a pupil simply belonging to a local education authority area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Member for Western Isles does not have a copy of the 1980 Act either. But he will find the answer to his question in section 23(3) of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is rattled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles made a long speech. He has taken up the Committee's time asking questions about an Act, which he does not have with him in Committee. He could have obtained one from the Vote Office. That reinforces the view of many of us; that he has simply been taking up the Committee's time and is not genuinely seeking to discuss the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for the hon. Gentleman's enlightenment, I shall quote section 23(3) of the Act. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing the areas to which particular classes of pupils receiving school education are to be deemed to belong for the purposes of this section and any such pupil to whom the regulations apply shall be deemed to belong to the area determined in accordance with the regulations. Any other pupil receiving school education shall, for the aforesaid purposes, be deemed to belong to the area in which his parent is ordinarily resident, and any pupil receiving further education shall be deemed to belong to the area in which he himself is ordinarily resident:</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that any pupil who becomes ordinarily resident in any area wholly or mainly for the purposes of attending an educational establishment providing further education shall be deemed to belong not to that area but to any area to which he was deemed immediately before he became so resident."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill asked how would one know whether a pupil belongs to a specific area. I think that I have dealt with that. Perhaps I could give her some additional information as I know that she is fascinated by the subject. Clause 69(2) states that expressions used in the Bill and in the 1988 Act have,
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the context otherwise requires",</p></blockquote>
the same meaning as in the 1980 Act. As I have said, under section 23(3) of that Act, a pupil is
	<br><blockquote><p>"deemed to belong to the area in which his parent is ordinarily resident".</p></blockquote>
I hope that that clears up the difficulties Opposition Members have with what is a technical provision, and one which I commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister say that the boards of management would be expected to provide only the names and addresses of the pupils to the education authorities under clause 27. He must accept that it would be up to the education authorities to know the cost of educating pupils who come from another area. For example, if 15 pupils from Fife attended a school in Dundee, Tayside education authority would be expected to have all the relevant information. It would know the amount of direct educational expenditure in respect of the pupils, the cost of essential services, and the expenditure and provisions under the services in clause 24(3) that cover pupil's transport, clothing and so on. The authority must obtain that information from somewhere. The Minister said that the authority would not obtain it from the boards of management, so it must be expected to hold such information itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister said that, under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, individual schools are required to publish their expenditure for any given year. Surely that should have applied to boards of management instead of to education authority areas. Perhaps he could enlighten the Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would happen if Tayside's calculation of what it would cost to take those 15 pupils from Fife is not agreed by Fife regional council because it had a different system of calculating such a cost? How will that argument be settled? If Tayside and Fife cannot agree on what it costs to provide services to those 15 pupils, how will the Secretary of State for Scotland decide between the two education authority areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was disappointing, especially when he attempted to explain the meaning of "having connection with". When he read from a section of the 1980 Act, I had the same difficulty as when I read it, because he made it no clearer. The Minister is responsible for this legislation and I had hoped that he would know what it means and could enlighten us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister for a specific example because, as any teacher knows, any pupil can parrot a formula that has been given to him, but the true test of understanding is if the pupil can use the formula to present an example that illustrates its operation. If the Minister cannot provide us with an example of that formula, we must assume that he can only parrot it without understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>CHANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS OF SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 18, line 6, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>', but no such ballot shall be held within a period of five years beginning with the incorporation date as determined under section 18(2) of this Act.'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 28(1) allows a self-governing school to change its characteristics at almost any time after the date on which it is incorporated. The purpose of the amendment is to discover whether the Minister is prepared to include in the Bill a commitment given by the Secretary of State for Scotland on Second Reading. As I recall it, the right hon. Gentleman gave a clear statement of intent by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am on record saying that I do not envisage it being appropriate in the first few years, for a school that has achieved self-governing status to want to change its character in any major or fundamental sense."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c. 627.]</p></blockquote>
That is not the sort of statement of intent with which we could be happy because it is qualified by the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any major or fundamental sense."</p></blockquote>
It seems obvious that the Secretary of State would accept that any self-governing school, almost immediately on incorproation, could use the powers in clause 28 to change its characteristics and, as long as those changes were not made
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any major or fundamental sense"</p></blockquote>
he would allow them to go through. Perhaps we first need the Minister's explanation of what the Secretary of State for Scotland meant by the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any major or fundamental sense."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman may believe that if the admission criteria were changed so as to allow selective criteria for admission to any school, that would not constitutee a "major or fundamental" change of the characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland may have accepted that a proposal to change the denominational nature of a school would not be considered to be a "major or fundamental" change. Equally, if there were an attempt to change all the other different characteristics that are affected by clause 28, the right hon. and learned Gentleman might assume that that would be a "major and fundamental" change in the characteristics of a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is important that the Minister should explain exactly what the Secretary of State meant when he made that statement on Second Reading. It is also important that the statement of intent that the right hon. and learned Gentleman made should be given statutory force by specifying in the Bill that no change in characteristics should be possible during the first five years of self-government of any school. The fact that COSLA suggested five years may be significant because the Minister suggested that self-governing schools should begin to opt out as early as 1990. I clearly remember reading that in one of the briefing notes that was given to the Committee. Therefore, if the amendment were carried, the five year requirement contained in it would mean that it would be impossible for a self-governing school to apply for a change in characteristics before 1996. That is a relevant date. I am sure that Conservative Members have 1996 rather than 1992 imprinted on their brain because 1996 could be two general elections away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

1996 could be two general elections away, and it would be that long before a school could change its characteristics if we accepted the amendment. That may be to the advantage of Conservative Members who are misguided enough to believe that not only should schools be allowed to change their characteristics but that that would be popular and would benefit the Tory Government in Scotland. The Tories naively believed that the poll tax becoming the focus of the 1987 general election would be to their benefit. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it received a marvelous reception and was so popular that it should be put to the Scottish people, but the Tories were massacred at the polls in 1987. We are trying to protect them from the fate that they suffered in 1987, and prevent them from being so foolish as to go to the Scottish people with such a measure built into the legislation. We are trying to save them from themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the major party in Scotland should have an opposition that puts them under pressure. Perhaps the Labour party has had it too easy for too long in Scotland because of the opposition afforded by the Conservative Party. The Conservatives should return to the central ground and offer a legitimate debate instead of debating the extremes, which is what the fanatics want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would save the Government from their mad ideology. It would certainly promote stability in the Scottish education system, which we are concerned about, even if the Conservatives are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not that view of stability be inconsistent with the thrust of the new Right to destabilise Scottish education? In that context, five years would be difficult for the Government to absorb.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head. The last thing that the Minister, the hon. Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) want is stability in Scottish education. They are on record as wanting to wreck the system and replace it with free enterprise provision, which is set out in the pamphlet that has been referred to so often today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, it would at least help to promote stability. It would also give substance to the claim that Ministers made publicly in Scotland—although they do not own up in public to their real intentions—that self-governing schools would perform the same functions in their areas as they did before acquiring self-governing status. If that were so, it would be nonsense to suggest that as soon as they were incorporated they should be allowed to make major changes to their characteristics. As drafted, that is precisely what the clause allows them to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is important, that the amendment is accepted and that what Ministers claimed will happen does happen when schools opt out, because the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>957</span>
insist that they continue to perform the same function that they performed when they were under education authority control. That is at the heart of the difference between the two sides of the Committee. Is it a matter of extending parental choice and passing the control of funding and management to parents, or is it a matter of wrecking the system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a grave danger, as COSLA points out, that opting out will be used as a device by groups seeking to change the characteristics of certain schools. Certainly such groups exist, and their numbers may even be increasing. In 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 21 April, there is an article headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Freedom-fighters for more 'real' teaching"</p></blockquote>
and a campaign that calls itself the Campaign for Real Education—CONTRES instead of CONTRAS, but clearly from the same camp as CONTRAS. A number of people associated with the campaign attended a conference recently in the Grosvenor hotel in London. It was attended by Baroness Caroline Cox, who was mentioned earlier in our debate and has been associated with the far Right, as are many Conservative Members. A speech was made by the right hon. Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson), who I thought had left the House of Commons long ago, although I saw him tonight in the Tea Room for the first time since I came here. Mr. Patrick Moore, the astronomer, was chairman of the conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various points of view were expressed at the conference. The right hon. Member for Brent, North is reported to have said at one stage:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will never get the curriculum or standards right unless we get selection back in schools".</p></blockquote>
Those were the words of one of the Minister's colleagues, and I think that his view is shared by members of the No Turning Back group who believe that neither the curriculum nor standards will be right until there is a return to selection. There are groups around that have every intention of exploiting the clause as soon as schools opt out of education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Moore, who presents "The Sky at Night" television programme, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let's get rid of all this hypocritical nonsense that all people are equal."</p></blockquote>
There we have it! The man would be put in gaol for making such a statement if he lived in the United States of America, where the constitution enshrines the right of people to be equal. In this country, we sadly lack a constitution or a bill of rights that would give people such rights. It would put an end to nonsense of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Brent, North lamented the lack of Conservatives with any knowledge of teaching, but said that there were plenty of Labour educationists. It would appear that the right hon. Gentleman has been paying close attention to the activities of Conservative Members in this Committee, all of whom have shown a lamentable lack of knowledge about teaching or education, especially in Scotland. The right hon. Member went on to make an infamous assertion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"England had to bring in roofers from Ireland. Where were all the roofers? Playing truant in Newham?"</p></blockquote>
He assumes, of course, that the function of education authority schools is to produce roofers, navvies and labourers, while the core workers, the skilled workers and those who will go on to higher and further education go to the self-governing schools, the opted-out schools, the reincarnation of the former grammar schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the recent, well-publicised, comment of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) is the Idi Amin of Scotland? Does he regard that as a skilled or an unskilled job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to comment on whether Idi Amin was skilled or unskilled. Certainly the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) seems unskilled in his attempt to keep the Scottish people together; he seems determined to divide them and to allow the Conservatives to continue to get away with murder in Scotland. That is a matter for regret by everyone in the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has declared that he judges all men to be equal. Does that apply regardless of which football team they play for? Will he tell the Committee about the delightful tartan tie that he is wearing? If it is not the McAllion tartan, does that make him less or more equal than others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with amendment No. 139.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right to draw me back to the debate, Mr. Martin. When last I was on a Committee with the hon. Member for Tayside, North my Scottish origins were called into question by the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn), who accused my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) and me of being Irish immigrants who had no right to say anything about Scottish education. The hon. Member for Tayside, North is right that there is no such thing as a McAllion tartan, because we are Irish immigrants who came to Scotland over 100 years ago after the famine in Ireland. We have been here ever since, though, and that gives us some right to be considered Scottish and to claim an interest in the Bill. Certainly we have a far greater right than do many of the hon. Friends of the hon. Member for Tayside, North, who sit on the Back Benches of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dreadful thing about the weird group that met for dinner in the Grosvenor hotel a couple of weeks ago is that those people are real. They exist; they are not a figment of anyone's imagination. I did not make up the man who looks at the stars at night and then influences the Conservative party. I did not make up the right hon. Member for Brent, North and all the other people who contributed to the conference. Such people would be able to exploit the clause to change fundamentally the characteristics of a school. One of the participants condemned teacher training:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I look forward to the day when a public sector school may advertise the fact that none of its staff has been near a teacher-training college."</p></blockquote>
Those are the crazies who abound at present and who seek to exploit the legislation promoted by the Minister and his friends. One person went on to tell the meeting that
	<br><blockquote><p>"graduates did not need to be trained as teachers. Teaching is a natural ability that everyone has."</p></blockquote>
The Irish immigrants form an important and worthy part of the cultural mix of modern Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where were they at Bannockburn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My memory does not go back that far. I was not there myself, although no doubt the hon. Member for Tayside, North was, and will tell us about it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>
later. I am not sure whether that is true. The lady who was violently opposed to teacher training may have had a jaundiced view, because she
	<br><blockquote><p>"has a third-class philosophy degree, has tried unsuccessfully for nine years for a place on a Postgraduate Certificate in Education course since the independent school she taught in closed."</p></blockquote>
The whole clause is worrying. People from different religious backgrounds were present at the conference, too. Although there were crazies at the conference, they were not all crazies. Some people made serious points. One person interested in exploiting the change of characteristics allowed by the clause said that multi-cultural religious education did not work because it watered down all faiths. At present most education authority schools are concerned to preserve racial tolerance in Scotland—to make sure that the different races in Scotland continue to get on together, mixing with each other and learning about each other's culture and traditions. But there are people who do not agree with that, who want the races and religions not to come together but to stay separate, to go their own ways and to have their own schools. One such person at the meeting wanted to see the end of multi-cultural education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would care to add to his list of those who share that belief the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), who has said that Moslem pupils should be able to have their own schools and separate education. I should be interested to know whether the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook thinks that Moslems in Scotland are any different from those in England. Will the hon. Gentleman do the Committee the honour of adding to his list the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook, the deputy leader of the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting away from amendment No. 139. Perhaps we could return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer the question of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). Amendment No. 139 would prevent any major change of characteristic in a school so it would stop Moslem schools coming into being within the first five years of a school gaining self-governing status, which is an important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that education in Scotland should be divided along racial lines. I accept that those who disagree have the right to put their view, but equally I have the right to argue my case. My ideal solution would be for schools to continue to accept pupils, irrespective of racial or religious background, and to try to educate them on the basis that we are all equal. That is the principle that I pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some religious and racial groups may disagree and seek separate provision. I send both my children to Catholic schools, which have been traditional in Scotland since 1918. There is nothing wrong in essence with Catholic schools as compared with state schools. They are part of the education tradition that we have inherited in Scotland. No one would challenge it so long as the Catholic church and Catholic parents wish to retain separate schools for their children. It is their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>960</span>
We are asking whether not just Moslem schools but anyone who wishes to break away can use the clause to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the hon. Gentleman denying the Islamic community the same rights as the Catholic community in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot debate denominational schools on this amendment. The issue may be relevant to another part of the Bill but, interesting though it may be, it is certainly not relevant to this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take your advice, Mr. Martin, and not discuss the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I seek clarification. The clause deals with changes in the characteristics of a self-governing school and amendment No. 139 deals with the ballot. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"no such ballot shall be held within a period of five years beginning with the incorporation date".</p></blockquote>
Are you telling us, Mr. Martin, that it is not in order to consider the content of the ballot? Surely a ballot on whether to change the characteristic of a school will cover issues such as religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must remember that amendments are supposed to be precise. The amendment refers to holding a ballot
	<br><blockquote><p>"within a period of five years".</p></blockquote>
We should restrict our remarks to the period of five years, and not discuss the cause of the ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Bearing in mind your ruling, surely it would be in order for the Committee to draw attention during this debate to the fact that under the amendment the objective of the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook would be impossible to achieve. Surely that consideration is relevant in the context of this debate. The right hon. Member for Sparkbrook has said what he wishes to achieve, but the amendment would specifically rule out that possibility for five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make the point that remarks must relate to the wording of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can verify that my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) took no part in the proceedings of the conference to which I referred. Whatever his remarks about schools in England and Wales, he has made no such reference to schools in Scotland. He has no direct responsibility for Scottish schools, which come under the Scottish wing of the Labour party. We recognise that Scotland has a different education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. The Labour party's position has always been that education will be dealt with by the Scottish parliament as soon as we have a Labour Government. The priority of a Labour Government will be to set up a Scottish parliament which will deal with education and pass appropriate legislation, taking into consideration the Scottish cultural context and how that may differ from elsewhere. Conservative Members refuse to do that. They treat Scotland as though it was simply part of England. We do not share that perspective. Culturally and historically, Scotland is a different nation and must be dealt with as such.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
Conservative Members cannot accept that, and they keep trying to apply English solutions to essentially Scottish problems. That will not work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the deputy leader of the Labour party, or anyone else who is not a Scottish Member of Parliament, will make no utterances on Labour party policy concerning Scotland? If so, does that also apply to the leader of the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said no such thing. Responsibility for decisions on the Scottish education system will rest with the Scottish parliament. That is what my right hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook would say if he were asked, and my right hon. Friend, the leader of the Labour party, would give the same response: Scottish matters will be decided by a Scottish parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are wasting our time here because there will be a Scottish parliament after the next general election, and, anyway, the Bill will not be in force by then. However, we are here now and we must try to sustain the arguments. We want a five-year period in which to retain stability in Scottish education. All kinds of matters need to be dealt with in Scottish schools. The standard grade has not even been fully implemented, and many subjects have not yet been examined at standard grade level. The 16-plus action plan is not fully in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be appropriate at this juncture to explain to Conservative Members what the standard grade involves? That would be an educational exercise in itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it would be a valuable exercise, but I doubt whether they would listen. They listen only when they think that they can gain advantage for their party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard grade involves giving a certificate to all children in Scotland, so that no one is branded a failure. Those serious, radical changes in Scottish education will be disrupted if, within five years of a school opting out, the provisions, in-service teacher training and allocation of resources are changed. That is deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the conference to which I referred earlier, someone said that "selection must become self-selection" and that within five years of a self-governing school's existence, the people who attend that school would select themselves. That is a Darwinian approach to education—the strongest will survive and the most able will get in and everyone else will be kept out, whether they happen to live close to the school and want to go there. When asked whether that would include the right for Moonies to set up their own schools, the person said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yes, if parents want it, though I don't support the Moonies personally."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister does not support the Moonies, but within five years of the Bill's enactment, he could find that the Moonies are setting up directly funded schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I was not being frivolous earlier when I asked for a ruling on the content of the amendment. I have been listening to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) for some
	<span class='label label-info column'>962</span>
time. He has been rambling about grades, groups of people and all aspects of education. If that is in order, I do not understand why it is not in order to discuss religious education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is right. I have tried to bring the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) back to amendment No. 139. However, he is not the only hon. Member with whom I have difficulty in keeping to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, it is difficult to refer my remarks continually to the amendment, especially when Conservative Members are so anxious to disrupt what I say and pull me into areas where I should not be. Perhaps that reflects the time of night. There is probably a full moon outside. I am sure that Conservative Members are growing hairs on the backs of their hands and will soon display fangs and start to howl. The real Right is beginning to show itself. Conservative Members behave in such a manner only because Parliament is not televised. If the Scottish people were watching our proceedings on television, Conservative Member would behave differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my remarks, because I have been speaking for some time. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh no."] I am always bemused by the fact that my speeches are popular with Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A quotation from 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</i> concerns the education system that is required in Scotland and which the clause threatens seriously. It says: "The actual operation of the new system would be a matter for discussion with the local education authorities, as our general policy would be to allow local authorities to organise education in the way most suited to meet local requirements." That comes not from a Labour party policy document, but from a document called, "Scottish Education: Regaining a Lost Reputation", which was published in 1978 by Alex Fletcher, then the Conservative party spokesman for Scottish affairs, and by John McKay, then the principal maths teacher in Oban high school, but now the chief executive of the Scottish Conservative party. In 1978 they knew that what was required for Scottish education was to devolve control to the local area to allow local democracy to decide its priorities. That is why the Tories got more Scottish votes in 1978 than in 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the process of taking over the Scottish Conservative party, those hon. Members sitting on the Conservative Benches have driven it to the far Right, to the extremes of fanaticism. That is why it is losing support in Scotland and why, tonight, we are pleading for democracy and for a return to common sense regarding the provision of Scottish education. Unfortunately, the fanatics on the Conservative Benches do not listen to us. I hope that, for once, they will listen and support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
