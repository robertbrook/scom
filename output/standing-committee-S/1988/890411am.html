<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 5, line 32, after "charges", insert "at cost".<br><br>
First, may I welcome you back, Mr. Martin? Contrary to press reports, we are all delighted to see you in your normal place in the Committee.<br><br>
The amendment deals with the powers of self-governing schools to charge fees in respect of such education and facilities as are provided other than as part of school education. The Minister has already defined such further education and facilities. On 4 April, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We start from the standpoint that self-governing schools should…be able to provide a range of facilities, such as further education, voluntary instruction courses, social, recreational and cultural activities, physical education and training, organised leisure-time activities, and so on." [<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 4 April 1989; c. 309.]</p></blockquote>
That definition corresponds closely to what the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, which is responsible for the amendment refers to as adult and community education. The definition also corresponds closely to the concerns which the SPTC and many other bodies have expressed at the prospect of charging fees for this kind of education.<br><br>
We had a long debate on 4 April about how such educational provision should be funded. When pressed, the Minister conceded that public funding could be made available to self-governing schools to help them establish further education classes and other activities. He said first that funding could come via the education authorities, probably through some kind of franchising system such as McDonald's and Wimpy are already involved in, to provide services to the Scottish people. No doubt if we had Conservative education authorities in Scotland, we would have franchises a la Wimpy and McDonald's. But fortunately that is not the case, so we can confidently assume that no education authority will be granting a franchise to self-governing schools to provide FE classes on its behalf.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
The Minister also said that public funding could be made via specific allocations from the Government for specific projects. But he was very unspecific about the kind of projects for which he would authorise central funding to help establish FE classes in self-governing schools. He said that he was in favour of dancing classes being provided and he even defended FE classes on knitting as being possibly worth while. When the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) suggested German classes, the Minister looked positively enthusiastic. There is nothing wrong with the Minister being enthusiastic about knitting and dancing, although some people might be a little concerned at the prospect of someone with such extreme Right-wing views showing an interest in German. Apart from that, I am certain that no one would object to these types of classes being provided in any kind of school.<br><br>
The Minister went on to say that the public funding could come from money allocated to the schools under the Bill, part of which they could use to establish FE classes. He cited Strathclyde as an example of an education authority which already used the money it was given for school education to help to establish such classes. No doubt the Minister would argue that there is nothing wrong with that, and that education authority schools are in the same position as self-governing schools. To that extent, he would be right. I think that the Minister describes what he is trying to achieve as breaking the monopoly on further education which education authorities currently enjoy.<br><br>
Education authorities and self-governing schools will have similar powers to charge fees under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Under that Act, education authorities can charge fees for adequate facilities provided for voluntary further education in social, cultural and recreational activities, physical education and training. Those activities correspond almost exactly with the Minister's definition of the education in which self-governing schools may become involved.<br><br>
Problems emerge, however, when we consider how powers may be applied differently by self-governing schools and education authorities. The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council points out that at present adult and community education is provided either free of charge or at cost by most education authorities. But what would self-governing schools do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully and I have read amendment No. 93, but how will self-governing schools know what these costs are? Will they have costs and profits centres or other necessary information? Do education authorities have access to such information?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman read the brief from the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, he would know that education authorities already provide such classes at cost. As self-governing schools will not have the facilities to do the same,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
perhaps they should not be given the powers to provide those classes. Perhaps the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would like to develop that point and suggest that the Minister should reconsider whether self-governing schools should be given such powers.<br><br>
Before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I raised the issue of whether self-governing schools would provide such classes at cost or free of charge. In response to one of my hon. Friends in a previous debate, the Minister said that he expected that some self-governing schools would make courses self-financing through charges. That leads me to conclude that the Minister does not expect self-governing schools to provide further education classes free of charge. Perhaps they would be prepared to provide such classes at cost, but the hon. Member for Tayside, North suggested that they may not be capable of doing that.<br><br>
The Minister went on to argue that he could foresee that some self-governing schools would run profitable FE classes. On 4 April he said that
<br><blockquote><p>"self-governing schools might offer courses that people would want to attend, market them in such a way that people would be attracted to them and run them in areas of the city that were convenient for people."—[<i>Official Report, 1st Scottish Standing Committee.</i> 4 April 1989; c.333.]</p></blockquote>
In fact, self-governing schools would provide courses in the same way as any other private organisation would—at prices that the market would tolerate and that enabled them to make a profit. They might be a nice little earner for self-governing schools.<br><br>
The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council and many other bodies foresee a major problem, in that opportunities for individual learners may suffer. Yuppies may try to buy further education that they require. For example, if they want to make their continental holidays absolutely brill they may buy an FE course in modern languages at a self-governing school. If they have the money, they can afford it. But unemployed, single parents may require not only a bridging course to enable them to enter training or employment, but creche facilities and subsidised transport. No market-dominated system would meet the needs of those people. The market will always decide in favour of yuppies who are able to buy into courses, and against the unemployed and single-parent families who require a public subsidy to obtain access to courses.<br><br>
The SPTC also points out that if self-governing schools become involved in profitable courses, there will be a danger that such courses will assume more importance than the provision of the school education which is the schools' original purpose. We should not lose sight of the primary aim of a school. The market place can lose sight of it; as we know to our cost, it lost sight of it in the past. Legislation was required to interfere with the free market and to prevent children from being employed in factories and mines and in cleaning chimneys. The Government had to intervene to protect the interests of children. The purpose of my amendment is to prevent the market from dominating the provision of further education classes. It will ensure that when classes are provided outwith the education
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
authority, they will be furnished on the basis of cost, not profit.<br><br>
The SPTC briefing argues that education involves more than what happens between nine and four o'clock to individuals between the ages of five and 16 or 18. Education is a life-long process which cannot be confined to the formal timetable. What happens outside the school may be as important for a rounded education as what takes place in class. The SPTC cited sports clubs, school trips and visits as examples of activities for which it would be reasonable to charge the children involved in them. However, the SPTC also pointed out that the charges should not be fixed at a level at which the organisers of the activity could make a profit. It would be inimical to the traditions of Scottish education if a self-governing school charged fees for visits to museums or other institutions in order to make a profit with which to subsidise normal education. I hope that the Committee will fiercely resist such a move.<br><br>
It is not just the SPTC and Labour Members who take this view. Last week, in the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> the Paul Foot column reported that John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, the 11th Duke of Marlborough, also shares our views. Perhaps one of his relatives is a member of the Committee. The Duke was worried about money for school trips, especially those to Blenheim palace, and he wrote to Oxfordshire education committee asking that it
<br><blockquote><p>"ensure that adequate funds are made available for schools so that the children of this county are not denied the immense educational value of visits to Blenheim Palace and all other historic sites."</p></blockquote>
We do not have to guess who lives in Blenheim palace and who is likely to benefit from the fact that children go there. For entry to the grounds, the Duke charges £2 for children aged from five to 16, £3 for 16 and 17-year olds and £3.50 for those over 18. He has a natural interest in ensuring that public subsidies are available for school visits, even though he is the 174th richest man in Britain. I give way to someone who is perhaps higher in that ranking than the Duke.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman's amendment prevent schools from charging at below cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would. Clause 11 states that the boards of management may charge fees in respect of
<br><blockquote><p>"such education and facilities as are provided by them other than as part of … school education".</p></blockquote>
It can be argued that a trip to Blenheim palace is not part of school education, but a social, cultural or recreational activity for which the school could charge. If a charge is made for such a visit, it should be at cost and self-governing schools must not be able to make profits from the fees they charge. No education authority school would seek to make private profit from the charges it must levy occasionally for visits. The SPTC is trying to establish that important principle.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make my question clear. Would the hon. Gentleman's amendment prevent schools from charging at below cost?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must have misheard the hon. Gentleman initially. I thought that he asked whether the amendment would prevent schools charging at above cost. The answer to whether it would prevent schools from charging at below cost is no. Obviously, the provision of educational activities could be free or completely subsidised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment would prevent self-governing schools from providing a subsidy because it specifies "at cost", which does not mean below or above cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The SPTC raised that important matter. The Minister could make technical adjustments to provide educational activities free or at cost. We must establish the principle that self-governing schools be prevented from levying charges that allow them to make a profit. If the Minister is prepared to do that, let him say so, and then we can proceed. If he is not, we shall continue to debate this important matter.<br><br>
I have given up hoping for anything from the Minister. He cannot be taken at his word. Any Minister worthy of the responsibility for Scottish education would accept this non-controversial amendment. Only an extremist would argue against it, other than on the grounds that technical adjustments could be made to ensure that provision be below cost or free. We must not let slip the principle that no one should make a profit from providing educational trips for school children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman's amendment prevents opted-out schools from charging at below cost, it will not achieve its objective. The hon. Gentleman does not want schools to make a profit, but now he seems to be saying that schools will not be allowed to help parents in need because they cannot charge at below cost. They will have to charge at cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes I wonder what the point in speaking in this Committee is because nobody listens. I spent the last five minutes dealing with that. Obviously the hon. Gentleman was not listening to me, but was getting some whispered briefing from another hon. Gentleman to "ask this one next". I have dealt already with his point, as the hon. Gentleman would realise if only he would open his ears. The Minister is free to say that he will adjust the amendment so that schools may charge at below cost. It is important that the principle of the amendment be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having been caught out, the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
Gentleman is now flannelling and fluffing. What does he mean by profit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Give a Marxist analysis—read from "Das Kapital".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend advises me to give a Marxist analysis, but that would be a waste of time for the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). If schools provide further education classes, they must employ teachers and become involved in extra expense. If they make a charge to cover that expense and nothing else, that is at cost. But if they make a charge to cover that expense and then increase the charge to make a profit for the self-governing school to use however it wishes, that is offensive and should not be permitted. That is what I mean by profit. It is simple concept. It should not be possible to make money from the provision of the educational activities dealt with by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman expand further on what he means by cost? It is not the simple concept that he seems to suggest. Does he envisage it in terms of historic cost accounting or current cost accounting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was asked by a true business man. The Government are clearly arguing that allowing schools to become self-governing would make the provision of education much more efficient and cost-effective. Does the hon. Member now suggest that self-governing schools are incapable of moving in that direction and cannot even judge the costs of providing courses, as education authorities do at present? If so, the whole concept of self-governing schools should be dropped now and we should all agree to go home. Everyone would be happy with that, particularly me, because I have other things to do—including serving on another Committee three Rooms down this Corridor. No Conservative Member has yet questioned me on the principle of preventing profits from being made from the provision of the types of activity which the Minister has said that self-governing schools will be able to offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We Conservatives are a kindly lot. I have a suggestion which may get the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) out of his difficulty. He obviously needs help and guidance. What about amending his amendment to read "at or below cost"? Would that be closer to what he really wants to achieve?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful suggestion. I doubt whether the Standing Orders allow me to amend it at this stage. However, they allow the Minister to accept his hon. Friend's suggestion and to table an appropriate amendment. I recommend that he does precisely that. He would thus quickly establish the principle that money cannot be made out of education. That is what we are waiting to hear from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
the Minister this morning. If he rises to do that, the Committee will be able to get on to some of the more important debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Conservative Members are on record as saying that they want equality of opportunity. Would not the amendment fit that adequately? If they want equality of opportunity, no one will make a profit out of education. Would it not be reasonable for the Minister to come back with a new amendment? However, in view of the Minister's track record on the issue of the parents' majority on school boards, perhaps we cannot trust him to return with an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have no reason to trust the Minister, although until now his hon. Friends have trusted him. The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) made a constructive suggestion, and I am sure that the Minister will listen to him and to the reasonable arguments that have been put forward in the briefing from the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. I am sure that he will accept the principle of the amendment and will make the necessary technical adjustments to ensure that an appropriate amendment is written into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to speak to this amendment. As the Committee knows, I was absent last week and therefore did not arrive here prepared. However, it is clear from the speech made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that his amendment was tabled at the behest of some body which has not briefed him properly on its requirements.<br><br>
The amendment is defective. The hon. Gentleman ought to think again about seeking to insert garbage such as the phrase "at cost". If he is really trying to stop boards of management making a profit, he must clearly define what cost is—whether it is historic cost or current cost, and how it is arrived at. He must clarify that formulae, disciplines and procedures will be used. He would then be able to define profit more clearly, because it is not what he thinks it is. Such nonsense should not be put into law merely because he has been badly or insufficiently briefed and left floundering and unable to answer a straight question. I asked the question in all innocence because I had not been here nor read up on the matter. I was astonished by the hon. Secretary's reply and hope that he and his colleagues realise that, as far as is humanly posible, we should ensure that garbage and rubbish like this amendment is not put on the statute book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) moved the amendment and then pleaded for a completely different amendment. It is wise to understand an amendment before tabling it, and certainly before speaking to it. The hon. Gentleman suggested that I should amend the amendment in accordance with the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine), who tried to help him. I am not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
sure whether that will help me because I do not know what the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve. My hon. Friend suggested a measure that would prevent a board of management from charging for facilities above cost. He is not averse to it charging below cost, although that would be the effect of the amendment.<br><br>
The amendment is yet another attempt to restrict the freedom of a board of management. I am not sure what the practical effects would be even if it were amended as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich to bring it in line with the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East. Would the amendment apply to each separate charge levied by the board? What would happen to a local authority, which would operate under the same rules, if twice as many people enrolled for an evening class as the local authority had expected? Would the fees be halved to ensure that the course did not make a profit? I would be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's views on that practicality. The main point is that no such statutory restriction applies to charges levied by an education authority.<br><br>
It is ironic that the Opposition should be so anxious to bind self-governing schools to charge commercial rates. I recall that when we were preparing the school boards legislation a year or so ago, a good deal of fuss was made over the fact that if we gave school boards an unrestricted right to control the use of their premises, they would charge extortionate rates to Brownie packs and the like. That was all placed in sharp contrast to the benevolence of local authorities, which, we were told, scaled their charges to people's ability to pay. I should have thought the Opposition would want self-governing schools to be able to prove themselves no less benevolent, which means being free to charge below cost if they can see their way to doing so.<br><br>
Clause 11 aims to place the board of management in the same position as an education authority as regards existing Scottish legislation on fees and charges. There is, of course, one important exception—the self-governing school will not be allowed to charge fees for school education in any circumstances, while an education authority may do so in a limited number of classes or schools under section 3(2) of the 1980 Act.<br><br>
The Opposition's real argument is that local authorities can be trusted to behave reasonably, but the boards of management cannot. I say again that boards of management will be elected by parents and teachers. They will have to be responsive to the views of parents and others in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says that the board of management will be elected by parents, is he conceding to our demand that the majority on the board of management should be directly elected by parents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened, he would know that I said that the board of management will be elected by parents and teachers. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that I gave a commitment to the Committee to consider parental majorities and that I am sympathetic to creating conditions where parental majority can exist.<br><br>

The Opposition face the same problem on this amendment. They table amendments without understanding them. It would be convenient to the progress of the Committee if Opposition Members understood the meaning of their amendments before they tabled them. The Government are willing to respond to arguments made in Committee, but they have difficulties when they take amendments at face value only to discover that the Opposition meant something different.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Under clause 7(4)(b) the board has a duty to
<br><blockquote><p>"promote the use of the school premises and facilities by the community."</p></blockquote>
A board of management will, therefore, wish to expand the use made of school facilities, by letting them out to community groups or by itself organising provision for the community.<br><br>
It is entitled, where it can to raise some extra income, and indeed make a profit however that is defined. My hon. Friends were right to press the hon. Member for Dundee, East on that matter. Are we talking about marginal costs or a contribution to revenue. And how would that work? Must we assume that if a local authority ran courses, it would have to apportion heating costs between each course? That idea is absurd. What is wrong with making a surplus on some activities? The board of management could invest that surplus in other school activities. The board should be commended on doing that and not prevented by statute as the amendment seems to propose. The key point is the board's good judgment in carrying out its duties to the community under the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East will seek leave to withdraw the amendment, if not for reasons that I have given, because it does not do what he hoped it might.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand why the Government think that they are being so clever about the phrase "at cost". Any competent accountant will explain that it means whatever people want it to mean. When costs are calculated, it is obvious that capital and revenue costs are taken into account. It would be silly to ignore either.<br><br>
The Government are trying to be too clever by half. The clear intention of this straightforward amendment is to prevent two things. First, it is to prevent charging more than would cover the necessary outgoings. That would be unfair to parents who are struggling to pay the money. Secondly, it is intended to prevent charging less than the key cost because of who would have to pay. School cleaners who earn £1.60 an hour may end up paying.<br><br>
If the Government argue that legislation is never worded loosely or open to misinterpretation, I remind them of one hilarious example that I discovered when examining health and safety legislation. At one time the law required that safe access to a work place had to be ensured by an employer. Therefore, a highly trained and highly educated judge solemnly and with due thought said
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
that a case could not be upheld because an accident happened to someone who was leaving work, and that the law said nothing about safe egress from work. We must guard against that sort of thing happening because of the wording of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the hon. Member for Tayside, North uses such emotive language as "garbage", "nonsense" and "rubbish" in respect of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council and the amendments that it submits to the Committee. One does not normally expect elected Members to make such assertions about respectable organisations.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the arguments about the details of the costing to be applied. People say that those details should be provided by the Opposition if they move such an amendment, yet when the Minister suggested that self-governing schools will be funded in exactly the same way as though they had remained under education authority control, and we pressed him to say what costing methods would apply to ensure that that principle was upheld, he had no answers. I wish that the hon. Member for Tayside, North would intervene and accuse the Minister of talking rubbish, because the same principle applies to the Minister's case as to ours. We are trying to establish a principle to be applied by the Minister and his army of 10,000 civil servants in the Scottish Office, who, between them, should be able to come up with detailed costing recommendations and regulations for self-governing schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is behaving like an animal on heat, so I shall give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I did not say that self-governing schools would be funded in exactly the same way as education authority schools. Clearly, education authority schools will be funded by the local authorities through the rate support grant. I said that self-governing schools would be neither worse off nor better off. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but unfortunately for him, words and their meaning are important in making legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is no wonder I shake my head. The Minister has completely ignored the substance of my argument. I asked him to explain how he would ensure that self-governing schools would receive exactly the same funding treatment as they would had they remained education authority schools. He did not know the answer, and no Conservative Membery jumped to his feet and accused him of talking rubbish. But when the SPTC tries to establish an important principle about not making a profit, the Minister's lackeys shout about rubbish and nonsense. It is an effrontery to the Scottish people when those who do not even live in Scotland refer to Scottish schools and respectable Scottish institutions in that way.<br><br>
The Minister asks me to withdraw the amendment; I shall do so, but not for the reasons
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
that he suggested. He has the power to ensure that self-governing schools cannot make a profit from charges. The Minister said that he commends profit-making in Scottish schools as desirable. By withdrawing the amendment we can raise the subject again on Report, whereas if we forced it to a Division we would lose it and could not raise the matter again.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

MANAGEMENT OF DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 177, in page 6, line 7, after "of insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and regulation of curriculum and appointment of teachers in".</p></blockquote>
Having already experienced enthusiastic support from Opposition Members for my previous amendment, and my hon. Friend the Minister having eventually moved from neutrality to support, I am hopeful in proposing this amendment. I assure Opposition Members that it is not a conspiracy: it is quite straightforward.<br><br>
The amendment would apply section 21 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 in respect of denominational schools to self-governing schools. The relevant sections of the Act are about the appointment of teachers and supervisors of religious instruction in denominational schools being subject to the approval of representatives of the Church, about the time set aside for religious instruction or observance not being shorter than before, and about the facilities for holding religious examinations.<br><br>
It is not wholly unreasonable to describe such functions as "management", as in the clause, but most people would associate them not so much with that term as with the terms
<br><blockquote><p>"regulation of curriculum and appointment of teachers".</p></blockquote>
I am not in favour of unnecessary wording, but perhaps the present wording of the Bill is too encapsulated. My suggested wording would allow the Bill to refer more fully and accurately to section 21 of the 1980 Act and its application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for tabling the amendment. It is important for the Committee to understand exactly what the clause means. Self-governing schools, as well as parents and everyone else outside the Commitee, must know about the relevant provisions of section 21 of the 1980 Act. That section says that the appointment of teachers is subject to the approval of representatives of the Church in whose interests the schools are conducted. It also provides for the time set aside for religious instruction or observance to be not less than it was before the shool was originally transferred to the local education authority before the passing of that Act. Supervisors of religious instruction, too, are to be appointed and approved by the Church, and there is provision for the facilities for religious examinations to be held.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
My hon. Friend and I accept the clause, but it is important for its terms to be defined so that eveyone knows what it is about. In defining denominational schools for the purpose of the Bill we should specify more clearly what was intended by section 21 of the 1980 Act. I hope that the Opposition will agree that the amendment would provide a better definition of the clause and that they will join us in persuading my hon. Friend the Minister to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will give our view on the amendment. The Minister has made great play of the accusation that the Opposition are always trying to restrict the freedom of the board of management. Will that freedom be restricted by the clause or the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. Our intention is to improve upon the definitions in the clause, which does not make law but is a defining clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think of any arguments against the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). It helps to clarify the clause and I am happy to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be aware of the correspondence that is currently circulating from the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland about a possible change to the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 involving teachers. This is a serious point and not party political knock-about. We do not know whether the Government have consulted the Church of Scotland or the Roman Catholic church on this amendment. We have not discussed it with them. The Minister may accept the amendment, but we shall vote neither year or nay until we have looked into it.<br><br>
It is not just a simple definitional problem. The amendment refers to the curriculum and teachers, so it goes wider than a definition. Other issues are being considered by the churches and this matter may prejudice that debate.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly mystified by the hon. Gentleman's comments. The representations of the Catholic church are incorporated in the Bill in Schedule 10(6), so it is a little late for consultation. I was happy to accede to the request from the Catholic hierarchy that the ambiguity of section 21 of the 1980 Act following the Ruddy case should be cleared up. The Church is still considering whether it should consult on one further matter, but I responded positively to its proposals, which are included in the Bill. When we reach that part of the Bill the hon. Gentleman will be able to give his views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have made our point. The correspondence is circulating and discussions between my colleagues and the Church hierarchy are still taking place. It would not be wise or advantageous to take the matter further now. The Minister has made his view clear, as have I on behalf of my hon. Friends. Consultation is important to us.</span></p>

I want to concentrate on the amendment, but I reassure the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that it is a definitional amendment. It it were not, it would not have been accepted by you, Mr. Martin, as being in order. The relevant part of the clause is in brackets in line 7 and describes section 21. The amendment makes that description fuller and more accurate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured by that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not doubting the hon. Gentleman's point. I merely made a measured statement of our view of the amendment. It does not prevent the Government proceeding as they wish.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"being a school for which a school board is for the time being established.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 77 and the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 98, in page 6, line 41, leave out

<p>and Government amendment No. 180.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be helpful if I dealt with all the amendments now.<br><br>
The Bill provides that a school is not eligible for self-governing status until a school board has been established for it. We should, however, put it beyond doubt that a school has to have a school board in existence at the time when it initiates the opting-out process. Otherwise, one could—at least in theory—have the situation where a school which had once had a school board, but the board had been disestablished for want of parental support, could profess to bid for self-governing status. We have, therefore, tabled the three technical amendments.<br><br>
However, amendment No. 99 is quite a different matter. It would have the practical effect, obviously, of postponing commencement of the self-governing school's provisions for two years. There is no justification for that.<br><br>
The whole essence of this legislation is that it does not compel anyone to do anything. Schools should be allowed to decide themselves when they want to go for self-governing status. They should neither be hurried along nor unnecessarily held back. I am sure that most would be well advised to wait for a couple
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
years and get used to having a school board. After all, for the vast majority of schools, establishing a school board will be a worthwhile end in itself and they may never want to look further. We want only good candidates for self-governing status, not lame ducks. We want those schools to be ones that succeed. But it is one thing to advise most schools to wait for two years and quite another to compel them. My post in recent weeks shows me that the amendment would certainly be resisted in some quarters of Scotland at present.<br><br>
Schools will vary greatly in their ability to get together a competent group of people to take over management. Some could probably take over the management of their schools tomorrow, if they had the chance. Some might like to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) should not have the device that he has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The device is issued to all hon. Members who may have difficulty hearing. It is in the Whip this week, and I have applied to use it. You may recollect, Mr. Martin, that in my early years I spent much time in and near noisy aeroplanes. That has resulted in my suffering from a condition known as high-tone deafness which sometimes makes it difficult to hear when it is noisy. The House has very properly given consideration to the needs of hon. Members like myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the piece of equipment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is to enable me to hear what you are saying, Mr. Martin.—<i>[Laughter.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My apologies to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, any application for self-governing status will have to be looked at on its merits, and one of the considerations will be the competence which the school board shows in drawing up its proposals and preparing itself to take on the management of the school.<br><br>
Underlying the amendment, of course, is the Opposition's continuing ambivalence about the real demand for opting out. The question that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) has asked at least three times remains unanswered. If there is no demand, as the Opposition persistently maintain, the amendment is clearly irrelevant. But they know that there is a demand and an interest. It is no secret that even in the past week or two groups of parents have been to see me to explore with me what opportunities the legislation might offer them. One group is anxious that their school will be closed; another —[<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps the hon. Member for Fife, Central wants to intervene and reassure them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that in England the prime motive for opting out has been where schools are threatened with closure? Will he put it on the record that that is the case?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that about half the English schools that are opting for self-government face proposed closure. I do not know whether that counts as prime motivation, as it does not account for the other half. It is significant that the hon. Gentleman is to visit Stonelaw high school. He will no doubt obtain a first-hand account of the parents' views. I am sure that they would prefer the education authority to respond to their wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that I have accepted an invitation to visit that school, but the invitation was made so that I could hear about the problems. It is widely known in Scotland that the Minister is creating demand for opting out by exploiting the groups who have genuine problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not creating any demand. Strathclyde region must expect a response from parents when it proposes to close schools that are successful academically and enjoy parents' support. It is entirely right for me to explain to parents their options under the 80 per cent. rule or under this Bill, just as it was right for me to explain the position to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) yesterday afternoon, so that he could pass the information on to his constituents. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Fife, Central does not think it important for parents to be aware of the options.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that that allegation from the Opposition Front Bench is outrageous, given that the parents involved have the full support of their local Labour Member of Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. They have the support not only of their local Member of Parliament, but of their local regional councillor. They do not appear to have the support of the Opposition in the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the figures for school ballots in England. By 31 March, 63 schools had begun application procedures for grant maintained status. Fifty have held ballots, of which 37 were in favour and 13 against. No changes were proposed in 18 of the 37 schools, and outright closure was proposed in only nine cases. Other amalgamations, such as single-sex to mixed, which has been of such interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, or the loss of the sixth form, accounted for the remaining 10. The figures undermine the hon. Gentleman's point, because 28 of the 37 favourable ballots had nothing to do with closure proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or with any changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are changing their ground. They now say that they oppose not only closure, but any changes. They argue against the Bill and in favour of the amendments on the grounds that parents will be able to use the amendments to prevent changes from taking place. That shows the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
difference between our views.<br><br>
It is too early to say whether either of the groups of parents who have come to see me will decide to propose opting out, let alone whether they will obtain my right hon. and learned Friend's approval. The education authority may even take parents' wishes into account. But such cases are symptomatic. They are straws in the wind. It would simply be arbitrary to say to those people, "Sorry, you have a good case but you will have to wait for two years." In two years' time, the school that wants to opt out might not exist. The same argument applies to those who say that the Government have introduced the Bill too hastily. The general principle of the Bill has been publicly discussed in Scotland for a year. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood moved an amendment on the matter in the Committee that considered the School Boards (Scotland) Act. That legislation had nothing to do with the matter, but my hon. Friend ingeniously managed to keep in order. The ensuing debate was the longest that was held on any issue in that Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister believes that the issue has been debated in Scotland during the past year. Can he tell the Committee how many votes were gained by the Conservative party in the elections that were held in Scotland last year?</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to tell the Committee about the most recent election that was held in my constituency, where the Conservative vote increased from 41 per cent. to 51 per cent. In the district elections, the Labour party maintained control of Stirling district council only on the cut of the cards. From my experience of elections, therefore, I believe that things are going well, and that that is partly due to parental support for this measure.<br><br>
Anyone who was interested in the detail of how opting-out schemes might operate could have studied the legislation that went through Parliament last year. The Government made known, through the Queen's Speech in November, their intention to legislate, and four months passed before the introduction of the Bill. That is the opposite of hasty in parliamentary terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the mere suggestion that that timescale has been productive for consultation is nonsense? Is he aware that the churches, the SPTC and other organisations in Scotland are worried, because the Bill is being bulldozed through the House? The Bill, and especially the more sensitive issues, should be discussed further in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For an hon. Member who tried to jump six clauses in 15 minutes to accuse anyone of bulldozing is rich. The hon. Member for Fife, Central cannot pose as the defender of parental interests in Scotland when he sees the conduct of the Bill as an opportunity for an extended series of press conferences. I do not believe that my hon. Friends are impressed by the hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
The Government will continue to consider amendments and suggestions carefully, and I hope that the Opposition will do the same.<br><br>
I have met the SPTC and members of the Scottish Consumer Council and I have thanked them for their help and support. The SPTC supports the principle of self-governing schools, although I acknowledge that there is a difference of opinion between the SPTC and the Government about how soon the measures should be available. I am sure that the same difference of opinion exists between the constituents of the hon. Member for Rutherglen and the Opposition. I believe that the measure should be available for those who wish to take advantage of it.<br><br>
One of the SPTC's arguments in defence of its view that there should be a delay in introducing the provision on self-governing schools is that there may be confusion with school boards. The hon. Gentleman has complained of inadequate consultation. Because the proposals in the Bill were announced in advance, more time for debate and consultation on it has been allowed than for the School Boards (Scotland) Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that there is no comparison—in terms of impact, the structure of education in Scotland and the choice offered to parents—between the concepts of the school board and those of opting out? It should be put on record that there is an enormous difference, which should be reflected in the period allotted for consultation. That period has been disgracefully short and shows contempt for the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wholly agree with the first part of that statement. There is a big difference between the school boards legislation and this legislation. Every school in Scotland is affected by the former because the Act requires every school to establish school boards. This legislation will affect only those schools that wish to become self-governing.<br><br>
Until the hon. Gentleman answers the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle about the number of schools that he expects to become self-governing, it will be difficult to answer his question. He presumably believes that a large number of schools will wish to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then why does he ask the question? If only a few schools will be affected, the School Boards (Scotland) Act will have a greater impact on the Scottish education system than the Bill before us. Once again, the hon. Gentleman holds two mutually exclusive positions at the same time and fails to accommodate them. I believe that Scottish parents understand my position and have not been taken in by the hon. Gentleman's propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not want opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If they do not want self-governing status, they will not take it. The hon. Gentleman's fear is that parents might opt for it, and he wants to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
move heaven and earth in Committee to prevent their having the opportunity to do so.<br><br>
Evidence supports my view that Scottish parents are well aware of the difference between the School Boards (Scotland) Act and this Bill. In three months in late 1987, when consultation took place on school boards, we received almost 8,000—and I hope that the hon. Gentleman is listening—separate representations on our original proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: More than 99 per cent. were opposed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only the EIS claimed that 95 per cent. were of that opinion, and that was itself a gross distortion. The System 3 poll found that 69 per cent. supported our proposals. The EIS and the Labour party have lately come round to supporting them.<br><br>
I repeat the fact that during three months of late 1987 we received almost 8,000 representations on school boards. In the three months from December 1988 allotted for consultation on the self-governing schools legislation, which the hon. Gentleman claims to be strongly opposed and unwanted, we received a total of 80, rather than 8,000, responses. There were 100 times more responses on school boards during a similar period. Opposition Members should know that some education authorities have still to respond to the proposals, which is extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The so-called consultation process on opting out received so few responses because organisations in Scotland were treating the Scottish Office with the contempt with which it was treating Scottish education. It is nonsense to compare the two consultation processes. Why was there such a difference between the responses to them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should explain why there should not be such a comparison. I understood his argument and his whole approach. He wanted to raise Scottish parents and create a united campaign among the Churches and other interest groups to fight the Bill. He now suggests that there were no more than 80 replies because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no consultative process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We published our proposals and invited suggestions. The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, the Scottish Consumer Council and others helping the Committee with amendments responded, and did so positively. The hon. Member for Fife, Central should accept that Scottish people realise that the Bill is permissive. It allows schools to take advantage of its proposals. The school board proposals applied to every school in Scotland and, rightly, there was a greater response. The hon. Gentleman might say that we gave a higher profile to the school boards or that there was more attention from the media. However, the difference between 8,000 and 80 replies shows that the Scottish people understand that it is permissive legislation, available to schools that want to take advantage of it.<br><br>

The hon. Member for Fife, Central is trying to delay the legislation by two years because he is worried that some schools may take advantage of it and benefit from it. The sound of the breaking of the local authority monopoly is a noise that the Opposition could not bear to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The real objective emerges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The objective is to end the local authority monopoly of education provision, so that parents who disagree with an authority's decision have an alternative. That is why the hon. Member for Rutherglen discussed with me yesterday what the alternatives might be. He rightly thinks that there should be alternatives. Interested parents and, in due course, school board members will recognise that decisions on seeking self-governing status are relevant to the future of individual schools.<br><br>
I commend Government amendments Nos. 76, 77 and 180 to the Committee and I call upon the hon. Member for Fife, Central and his hon. Friends to withdraw amendments Nos. 98 and 99.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rather than allaying our fears, the Minister's response reinforces our arguments. He said that parents should be allowed to go at their own pace. We should dearly love him to keep to that statement, because 95 to 98 per cent. of parents who responded during the school boards consultation period were against the Government's proposals. Despite that massive rejection of the proposals, the Government decided to go ahead for their own ideological reasons. They did not consult any interested parties in Scottish education, be they teachers, parents or those in the wider community.<br><br>
When the 1988 Act was debated we said that school boards were essential so that the Government could pursue their longer-term objective in setting up self-governing schools to break the link between local education authorities and the community. School boards were therefore essential.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
It is clear that the Government invented the demand for self-governing schools. The Minister argues that public debate was aroused in Scotland, but I should like to know the views expressed so that we can discuss them. Even the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council said that comprehensive education was at stake and that it might be compromised by the Minister's proposals. Open and informed debate is required.<br><br>
In the weekend press I read that in his address to Young Conservatives the Minister said that comprehensive education—to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker)—was garbage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not believe everything that he reads in the <i>Glasgow Herald.</i> What I said at the weekend is what I said to the Committee: that the Opposition maintain that comprehensive education has been a success, but research by Edinburgh university shows that to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
incorrect. However, I shall not rehearse the arguments that have been put in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can take that on two levels—the objective and the subjective. At the objective level, comprehensive education has been a success; sufficient academic studies have been carried out to prove that. At the subjective level, if the Minister took time to go round the communities and schools in Scotland, he would find that people welcomed the establishment of comprehensive education in the late 1970s. The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council says that the system is now under threat because the proposal to introduce self-governing schools has been brought forward to hastily.<br><br>
In the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 choice was the key word. If clause 13 is not amended, parents will have less choice. That worries us. If the Government wanted choice, the 1988 Act would have allowed every school to decide whether to have a school board, but no choice was given because the Government had this follow-up legislation in mind. So there was a hidden agenda in 1988 and it is worth exposing it now.<br><br>
The Minister has had plenty to play with, as I believe that the Macbeth report, which was published in 1980, examined the operation of schools councils. Schools councils were not operating in Scotland as they should and the Macbeth report was valuable in pointing that out and in showing how parents could co-operate more fully. We thought that that was the purpose of the exercise, but it is clear that schools boards were not the purpose of that exercise, because they were not given a chance to work before we were confronted with self-governing schools.<br><br>
The Scottish Parent-Teacher Council says:
<br><blockquote><p>"There will be a real danger that parents will be reluctant to stand for election to school boards because of the fears and uncertainties of opting out."</p></blockquote>
The 1988 Act said that school boards would have a duty to promote contact between parents, schools and the community. That is hollow in the light of these proposals. Amendment No. 99 asks
<br><blockquote><p>"for at least two years immediately preceding the proposal to seek self-governing status."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable suggestion. If the Minister is interested in Scottish education and wants to see parents and teachers in a community getting together, he will allow time for the school boards to be established, so that parents can gain experience in the management of schools and assess how much progress has been made. Then they can determine whether they want to take even more power into their hands by applying for self-governing status. Far from the two-year proposal being a blocking mechanism, it is an opportunity for school boards to be established and for people to assess how much progress has been made.<br><br>
The Scottish Consumer Council asked the Government to go canny on that, because it thought that the proposals were ill-timed and did not offer parents an extension of choice. The chairman of the Scottish Consumer Council, Barbara Kelly, who has not been uncritical of the Government at times, said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"It's as if pedal cyclists who want to move to a powered vehicle are told that they can only move to jet aircraft and not to motor cycles or motor cars! This in theory is an extension of choice but it is one that would be of little use to pedal cyclists."</p></blockquote>
It is one which would be of little use to the Scottish education community.<br><br>
For the Minister to be consistent, he should argue that if schools are to achieve self-governing status, they should do so through progressive delegation of powers without having to move out of the education authority system. That is what he promised at the time of the school boards consultation, when the floor and ceiling proposals were made. But, within a year, he has departed from that position.<br><br>
The Scottish Consumer Council fears that if schools are allowed to opt out in communities, especially rural ones where parents have little or no choice of school, the proposals
<br><blockquote><p>"could result in a determined group of parents getting their school to opt out without the wider community being sufficiently consulted, including parents of prospective pupils."</p></blockquote>
I made that point during the Committee stage of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 when the issue of unrepresentative parents was debated. To date, the Minister has given no response—certainly no satisfactory response—on how to prevent unrepresentative parents taking over. A very small minority, constituting less than 1 per cent. of eligible parents, could decide the fate of the school, not just at the beginning, but in the long term.<br><br>
The Minister is doing a disservice to parents in Scotland. He is not giving them a wider opportunity, because he is interested only in his political objectives. To secure those objectives, he wants to see a small rump, or minority, of parents take over, so that the link between the local authority and the schools can be disestablished. The Scottish Consumer Council fears that if such parents take over, it
<br><blockquote><p>"could have a significant effect on the community if parents who do not like this decision decide to move away to educate their children elsewhere."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Consumer Council realises that schools have an effect on the wider community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's enthusiastic support for the Scottish Consumer Council. Has he noticed that it has tabled amendments to bring ceiling powers for school boards back into the arena? He talked about people changing their positions. Will the hon. Gentleman be supporting that proposal in a year's time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not give the Minister a ready response to that. I have learnt from the Minister during our proceedings. The Minister is circuitous in his answers, so I shall just ape him on this point.<br><br>
If the Minister was consistent in his arguments about school boards, this Bill to introduce self-governing schools would not be before us. The Minister was saying to the Scottish people that there was a progressiveness in the proposals. There is no progressiveness here, and that is acknowledged in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
Scotland. This self-governing Bill will have a cataclysmic effect.<br><br>
The Minister should remember that logic is not on his side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following my hon. Friend the Minister's remarks about the Scottish Consumer Council, the hon. Member for Dumbarton has also cited it in support of his argument. I wonder whether he has read the article in <i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</i> by Peter Gibson, the director of the Scottish Consumer Council, who concludes—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not read from an article during an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. Peter Gibson argues that working-class people are most anxious to use whatever tools are available to improve the education system. He argues that the Bill has much to commend it and that it should be given a fair wind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I worked in Scottish education for 20 years and I know that working-class people are anxious to improve the system. For an hon. Member to tell me that is like taking coals to Newcastle. The hon. Gentleman should come to Scotland and go to some schools. Then he may be able to say that there are legitimate reasons for him to be on the Committee.<br><br>
The Scottish Consumer Council is consistent in its argument. It listened to what the Minister said at the time of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. The Minister has departed from that logic and that is why I quote from the council and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. The Scottish Consumer Council argues that opting out is an extreme course that few parents will choose in the short term because
<br><blockquote><p>"they have a complete lack of experience in running schools in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure about that. We all have different opinions on the impact of the opting-out proposals, but it will destabilise the provision of education in Scotland. The proposals are designed to put parent against parent, and to put parents against local authorities. However, no one can predict the effects that the hostile proposals will have.<br><br>
The Scottish people believe that schools are valuable assets to the community. We are afraid that those feelings will be undermined because of the haste with which the proposals will be enacted. The wider community should be consulted and that is why we have tabled our amendment. We hope that the Government will see sense and consider the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) referred to the Government's supposed hidden agenda. Amendment No. 99 certainly contains a hidden agenda. It is about trying to extend the timescale so that the people of Strathclyde do not have any

options over Stonelaw high school. The amendment is designed to prevent parents at that school from using the legislation.<br><br>
The Member for Fife, Central may wish to deny what I have said. I shall happily withdraw my remarks if he associates himself with the position taken by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dissociate myself from the further attack made by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) on Strathclyde regional council. I associate myself with the general concerns of those in Strathclyde who want a decent education system, but who resent the exploitation of the issues on the wider stage for cheap political ends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman alleges that the position taken by the hon. Member for Rutherglen is one that pursues cheap political ends. I understand the hon. Gentleman's answer to be no. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) rightly referred to the legislation on school boards as the amendments deal with the relationship between schools boards and self-governing schools. His allegation that there were no changes to the school boards provisions following the consultation period was absurd. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) has said many times that there were substantial changes as a result of the genuine consultation process. It is absurd to suggest that the provisions that we are considering have not been in the public domain for some time.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
I refer with all due modesty to the debate that I initiated during the oassage of the School Boards (Scotland) Bill. The Committee has made unflattering references to some members of the press, so I remind hon. Members of the excellent article given prominence in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> last year and other articles elsewhere about this issue.<br><br>
There is no continuum between the provisions for school boards and those for self-governing schools. Technically, the existence of a school board makes it easier to move to self-governing status, but it is not a necessary precondition of such a move. The essence of school boards is parental involvement whereas that of self-governing status is parental choice. I shall not delay the Committee, so I conclude by referring again to a point that I made earlier and putting it in a general context.<br><br>
Amendment No. 99 would build a delay into the system. If a school wanted to gain self-governing status because of a difference of opinion between the parents and the education authority, the choice would be denied to the parents in the short term because the authority would have the time to implement its proposals. The two-year delay from October means that there is nothing that the parents can do about that. My hon. Friend the Minister is right to reject amendment No. 99. It is not the type of reasonable amendment that people of good will should support. It is a wrecking amendment which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
would prevent parents from moving a school to self-governing status in the short term. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will continue to resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hearing the arguments, I shall persist in supporting the amendment if only to remind the Minister of his logic at the time of the 1988 Act and to demonstrate to people such as the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) that if, as he says, there is no connection between that Act and the Bill, the Government can in all modesty—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for giving way. I am not suggesting that there is no connection but that there is no automatic continuum from the concept of school boards to that of self-governing status, although a school board can be of technical assistance in moving towards self-governing status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard the power behind the throne say that there is no automatic continuum, but that does not alter the fact that this Bill follows on from the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, which was a necessary precursor. I therefore press the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. In view of what the hon. Member has just said, it is only fair to point out that if the Government amendments are accepted, particularly Government amendment No. 77, Opposition Members will not be able to vote on their amendments because lines 41 and 42 will have been deleted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are you gently directing us along a particular line, Mr. Martin? Would it help if I withdrew my amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. They are not yet before the Committee for a vote. I am just explaining the position so as to avoid points of order later. I am certainly not trying to guide the hon. Member along a certain road.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Do we assume that Government amendment No. 77 was taken with Government amendment No. 76?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 77 was grouped for debate with amendment No. 76. We will reach those amendments after the next three groups.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 6, leave out lines 22 to 25, and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) decide, by a resolution passed at a meeting of the board ("the first resolution") to hold such a ballot and immediately thereafter consult the education authority by whom the school is maintained and following such consultation confirm the first resolution by a resolution ("the second resolution") passed at a subsequent meeting of the board held not less than twenty-eight days, nor more than forty-two days, after that at which the first resolution was passed; or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) receive a written request to hold such a ballot which meets the requirements of subsection (4) below.".</p></blockquote>
Clause 13(1) empowers a school board to hold a ballot of parents on the question of self-governing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0283">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
status simply by resolving to do so at a single meeting of the board. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the board first seeks the views of the education authority and is given an opportunity to consider those views at a subsequent meeting of the board before finally deciding to ballot the parents on the issue. The amendment would also bring the provision into line with the equivalent provision in England and Wales under section 61 of the Education Reform Act 1988. We do not want any of the proposals to go through with undue haste. We want the school board to have the opportunity to discuss the implications of the proposals with parents and the education authority before it moves on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of a series of rather interesting amendments which would bring our Bill in line with English legislation. It is curious that these arguments should be advanced by those who, erroneously, have argued that the Bill is an anglicisation measure. The amendment would require a second resolution of the board once it had decided to gain self-governing status and a ballot.<br><br>
One argument that has been used by local authorities against our proposals is that the opting-out procedure will be used by schools as a blocking tactic against closures and reorganisations. It has also been claimed that the prolonged uncertainty caused by the process could demoralise a school. Having listened to the arguments, I thought that it would be inappropriate to require a second resolution. Although the process will take some time, it must be allowed to run its course without the threat of being cut short by the sudden decision of the authority to close the school.<br><br>
Within those constraints, we are anxious that the process should be as swift, clear and decisive as possible. That is why we opted for a shorter procedure than the English legislation permits. Tabling amendments that simply follow the pattern of English legislation is not appropriate for a Scottish Standing Committee. The Opposition should consider that.<br><br>
The decision by a school board to have a ballot is not decisive. The ballot is far more important and ultimately the whole procedure is subject to the Secretary of State's agreement. The idea of a board having to make a resolution and then confirm that resolution at a second meeting might be appropriate if that resolution were decisive. As it comes at the beginning of a three-stage process, it seems unecessarily cumbersome to require the board to take the same decision twice. The amendment will not help anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 6, line 25, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"after the 'proposing group' as in paragraphs (a) or (b) above has prepared, and presented to those eligible to vote, its proposals for acquisition of self-governing status, as specified in section 16, subsections (2). (3) and (4) of this Act".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 112, in clause 16, page 8, line 33, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"before the end of the period of one month beginning with"</p></blockquote>
and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"not later than two months before".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government and other Conservative Members claim frequently that the Bill gives parents power and freedom. The amendments test that claim. Opposition Members know that the Bill is all about parents surrendering the powers that they would have under a school board if the school moved to self-governing status. Parents would then be the minority on a board of management, which would, in effect, be a quango and be under the Secretary of State's control. The Bill has nothing to do with parent power.<br><br>
However, if the Government and Conservative Members are serious about parent power, they should support the amendments. They require a school board, or those parents wanting a ballot on whether to have self-governing status, to put before parents a prospectus outlining the nature of the school after it became self-governing. As we all know, knowledge is power. To give parents who will vote on whether schools become self-governing an idea of the future under self-governing status would enhance their knowledge and so give them greater discretion and powers when they vote.<br><br>
Amendment No. 94 requires the group proposing a ballot on self-governing status to put before parents details of what self-governing status would entail. Amendment No. 112 specifies that the proposals should be put forward not later than two months before the date of the ballot.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
If parents are to make an informed decision when they vote on self-governing status, it is essential that they know beforehand what self-governing status entails. For example, they should know what the composition of the new board of management would be, and whether they would be giving up a majority position on the school board and moving into a minority position on the new board of management. Following the Minister's back-pedalling on the assurance that we thought we had gained from him, they will no longer have a democratically elected majority on the board of management. They should know about the admissions policy that the new self-governing school will adopt and about any special emphasis or character that it will have. Parents will need such information in advance of the ballot if they are to make an informed decision.<br><br>
It baffles me that any Conservative Member should object to the amendments. What objection can there possibly be to giving parents such information before the ballot? There cannot possibly be an argument about the practical difficulties of gathering together such a prospectus, because the Bill requires that prospectus to be made available to parents within a month after the ballot has been held. That presumes that those who are initiating the move towards self-governing status already have a fairly clear idea of where they want the school to go. Therefore, it should not be a problem for them to put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
together a prospectus for parents before the ballot takes place.<br><br>
That is important not only to give information to parents. If the initiative came from a school board, it would be nonsense for it to say to parents, "We want to move towards self-governing status; we have decided to hold a ballot but we will not tell you a single detail of what that self-governing status would mean." If a school board decided to hold a ballot about the status, it should be required to give to parents exactly the sort of detailed prospectus that it would be required to produce a month after the ballot.<br><br>
Likewise, the initiative might come from a group of parents—for example, from the 10 per cent. of parents who had signed a petition—who said to the rest of the parents, "We should like to have a ballot on self-governing status." It would be incumbent upon that 10 per cent. of parents to explain to the other 90 per cent. exactly what they envisaged in terms of admissions policy, special emphasis, powers of parents and the future membership of parents on the board of management.<br><br>
It is incumbent upon any group requiring parents to make a decision to inform the parents well beforehand about the future management of the schools, the status of parents in that management and the admissions policy. It would not be impractical to give them such details two months before the ballot. If Conservative Members are genuinely interested in parent power and enhancing parents' discretion, they must be in favour of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) put his case well, sensibly and logically, but some questions still need answering. I am not against people having information. It is essential in any decision-making process that as much information as possible is available.<br><br>
However, I doubt that any group of individuals could provide such detailed information and prepare such a prospectus. How would that be dealt with mechanically? Who would fund it and how would it be done? Where would they get the necessary data and how would they print the prospectus? I am not against the idea in principle, I am just curious to know how it can be achieved.<br><br>
Much of what the hon. Gentleman said has merit. People may be dissatisfied with the way in which the local authority runs the school that their children attend. There may be enough of them to meet the statutory requirements for setting in motion the procedure for self-governing status. The ballot just triggers off the process; the decision will eventually be made by the Secretary of State. If we are to amend the Bill in this way we should understand the mechanics of it. We need more explanation than the hon. Gentleman has given us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). The mechanics are spelt out in clause 16. The Government propose that the school should provide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
the Secretary of State for Scotland with such a prospectus after the ballot. We suggest that it should be provided to the parents before the ballot so that they can make a reasonable judgment about whether it is a good idea to opt for self-governing status. That is a fair argument.<br><br>
Under section 15 of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, if a school board's application to an education authority for the delegated functions is refused, it has the option of going to ballot. Before it does so, under schedule 3 of that Act it must provide:
<br><blockquote><p>"a ballot paper;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>a statement of the School Board's proposals and of any reasons for them given to the authority by the Board;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>the reasons given by the authority under paragraph 2 above for refusing the request, and any reply thereto made by the Board."</p></blockquote>
In the ballot for the delegation of powers to the school board, parents have a chance to make a judgment before they cast their votes. We suggest that they should also have a chance to make a judgment about the proposals for opting out before they cast their votes.<br><br>
The clause as it stands provides that parents vote for the principle of opting out without knowing what is involved in detail. They should have the prospectus before they vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the debates with interest. As the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said, the two sides of the Committee do not have fundamental differences on the issue before us. Supporters of the Government's proposals also want parents to have the appropriate information at the appropriate stage and have enough time to consider it. This debate is different from some of our others.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Western Isles explained his proposals reasonably, and remarkably briefly, by his standards—usually the second 20 minutes of his speeches is better than the first 20 minutes, and the third 20 minutes is even better than that. The whole Committee will be interested to hear how my hon. Friend the Minister responds to those proposals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has said, many of us have sympathy with what has been said about them.<br><br>
I shall follow the proposals in detail, although it is not easy to do so. That is no reflection on the hon. Member for Western Isles and his hon. Friends. Complications arise because we are dealing with two diffrent clauses at once. It would be helpful to know whether either of the amendments was suggested by any of the groups that send prospective amendments to members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman by telling him that amendment No. 94 is in line with the ideas of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council and that amendment No. 112 came from the Scottish Consumer Council. Despite having come from two different bodies, the amendments are closely connected. Amendment No. 94 does not refer to a specific period; that would appear in clause 16 as amended by amendment No. 112.<br><br>
May I suggest a couple of ways out of the difficulties mentioned by the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in connection with organisation and funding for the prospectus? It would not be a problem for a school board to fund and organise a prospectus because it would have to do so within a month of the ballot anyway. The problem would be for the 10 per cent. of parents. It would be relatively simple to add a further requirement that the school board assist parents whose petition has 10 per cent. support to prepare a prospectus to be submitted to all parents. The hon. Member for Tayside, North is right to say that the ballot is only a trigger—a whole chain has to be set in motion—but the ballot is the only opportunity for the body of parents as a whole to have a democratic say in the transition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of the genesis of the amendments. I should certainly have remembered about amendment No. 112, because when I read the Scottish Consumer Council proposals in preparation for tabling my amendment, I wondered about tabling it myself.<br><br>
There could be no reasonable disagreement with the objectives of amendment No. 94. The question is what kind of information should be given to parents and in what form, at the appropriate time. Whether there are technical problems with the amendment or not I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the opportunity to put on record what kind of information he envisages being given to parents at different stages. The importance of parents having comprehensive information when they vote is fundamental. No one would disagree with that. It could be called a prospectus or something else. Parents should have fairly comprehensive information before they vote, so that they can make an informed choice. The hon. Member for Western Isles put forward that fundamental point.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 112 amends the period in clause 16. As I understand it, where a majority is shown in the ballot, the school board then publishes its proposals for self-governing status and submits them to the Secretary of State and the education authority within a month. If a school is denominational, they are also submitted to the church. Amendment No. 112 simply extends that period to two months. There are bound to be arguments for that, especially because of the possibility of the ballot and the summer school holidays, when people might go away and have difficulty in formulating their proposals quickly. My hon. Friend the Minister may riposte that the Secretary of State is not bound to insist on the one-month period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not be clear yet, but amendment No. 112 requires that the prospectus be made available
<br><blockquote><p>"not later than two months before"</p></blockquote>
the ballot. It is not a matter of extending the period after the ballot. Parents must be informed in detail before the ballot, on what they will have to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I have obviously misread the amendment. It is a bit complicated to refer to two clauses at the same time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
I fully understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but the argument still applies. There is bound to be a balance. There has to be a period for the process, and the Secretary of State may permit a longer period than one month. I think that I have read the Bill correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is after the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt my hon. Friend will give an accurate interpretation of the practical effects of the amendment. I am not sure that I have understood it properly. I am sure that that is my fault, and not that of the hon. Member for the Western Isles and his colleagues.<br><br>
The point made about information is generally correct. It is important for parents to have the right form of comprehensive information. I am not sure that amendment No. 94 is the right way to ensure that, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take the opportunity to say how he envisages information reaching parents.<br><br>
Amendment No. 112, which I suspect that I have misunderstood, is a matter of balance. There must be a resonable period of time for parents to receive information, and to consider and discuss it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of doing irreparable damage to the reputation of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), I shall say that I listened to his comments with great interest. Both sides of the Committee are anxious to ensure that parents are well informed, and that they do not make a decision without considering its consequences. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the way in which parents may be given further information before they come to the ballot.<br><br>
However, the practicalities must be considered. If a group of parents who represent 10 per cent. of parents at a school wish to persuade other parents to opt out, they would probably not do so without first preparing the ground to ensure that they would receive support. I presume that they would not choose to hold a ballot unless they were concerned to bring that about. They would proceed on the basis that they would win and persuade other parents to support them. As parents interested in requesting a ballot of other parents would prepare the ground by trying to disarm their critics and reassure those who might be persuaded to support time, the result may not be as potentially devastating as the hon. Gentleman suggests.<br><br>
However, it would be desirable for some information to be presented. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood asked what kind of information that would be. The Opposition cannot make up their mind whether to reject the Bill on the grounds that it follows legislation for England and Wales, or whether to propose amendments to bring it into line with that legislation. Section 61(3) of the Education Reform Act 1988 sets out the information that is required under that Act:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the governing body to secure that the prescribed body take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that every person who is eligible to vote in the ballot is—
<br><blockquote><p>(a) given such information about the procedure for and consequences of acquisition of grant-maintained status for a school as may be reasonably be expected to enable him to form a proper judgment as to whether or not such status should be sought for the school, including, in particular, the information required by subsection (4) below".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
Subsection (4) requires a great deal of information and I shall not bore the Commitee by reading it all out. However, subsection (4)(a) says that the information to be provided should be:
<br><blockquote><p>"(i) the procedure for acquisition of grant-maintained status for a school;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(ii) the constitution and powers of the governing body of such a school; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(iii) the conduct and funding of such a school".</p></blockquote>
Without imposing intolerable burdens on parents who wish to hold a ballot by requiring them to daw up a prospectus like the one provided by the school boards, those three headings are questions to which all parents would want answers before making a decision that would have substantial consequences for the school. Would the hon. Member for Western Isles and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary consider that point? Without running the risk of delaying the procedure unduly—I understand that my hon. Friend wishes to avoid creating uncertainty—these general headings could provide the basis for the supply of information to parents before a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendment No. 112, as it is more substantial than my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Eastwood) thought. If I have understood it correctly, it would mean that proposals for self-governing status must be available to parents before a ballot is held, whereas the Bill does not require the school board to publicise such proposals until the result of the ballot has been determined. I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) would confirm my interpretation, which if correct, represents a substantial change.<br><br>
There is no reason why amendment No. 112 should not be considered, except that it would be difficult to carry out its provisions if the procedure for acquisition was triggered not be a resolution of the board but by a written request from the parents. If the prescribed number of parents told the board that they would like to take advantage of clause 13(1)(b)—in other words, they put in a written request—how could they present proposals to be endorsed by the remainder of the parents? They would be a disparate group of people, and it is unlikely that they would have co-ordinated proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is conceding that it would be possible for a school board to present proposals. If it can do so a month after the ballot, it could do so a month or two before. In response to a similar inquiry from the hon. Member for Tayside, North I suggested that a further provision could be devised to require a school board
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
to assist a group of parents who met the 10 per cent. qualification to produce such proposals. The board could provide the skilled back-up and funding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman seeks to do. I am not necessarily opposed to his suggestion, but there are difficulties. As drafted, the Bill states that if 10 per cent. of the parents trigger the ballot, it will be the school board's responsibility to bring forward proposals after the ballot if there is a majority in favour of acquiring self-governing status. The hon. Member for Western Isles is suggesting that it should be the responsibility of those who have called for the ballot to present proposals upon which other parents will vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 7 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The board of management of the school shall secure that all necessary arrangements for the ballot are made".</p></blockquote>
So, if a sufficient number of parents write a request, it is the responsibility of the board of management to arrange the ballot, and the board could easily ensure that parents are given the necessary information as part of the ballot procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the main reason for the amendment is to make it the responsibility of those asking for a vote on opting out to present specific proposals to all the parents. It appears that the amendment is worthy of consideration by my hon. Friend the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My confusion arose because clause 16 as drafted deals only with post-ballot events. Technically, the proposals of the hon. Member for Western Isles might be better placed in one or two of the earlier clauses. I hasten to add that I am not criticising the hon. Gentleman, but if these changes are to be made they might be included in clause 134.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there is a slight problem. Clause 13 deals with the mechanism before a ballot is held. The hon. Member for Western Isles has quite correctly tabled an amendment to clause 16 which deals with the situation after a ballot has been held. I agree that if my hon. Friend the Minister were to consider accepting amendment No. 112, some consequential amendments to the drafting would be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both amendment No. 94, which refers to clause 13, and amendment No. 112, which refers to clause 16, are necessarily connected. Amendment No. 94 to clause 13 points the way to amendment No. 112, so the connection is there.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand entirely. Obviously, that is why you and your colleagues, Mr. Martin, grouped the amendments together. That is absolutely correct.<br><br>
I should be interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say about the amendments. There is certainly merit in the arguments that have been put forward.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) explained clearly the position on the amendments. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) seemed to think that he was confused, he was not. The problem arises because of the effect of the two amendments together. One deals with the pre-ballot, and the other with the post-ballot position. Although amendment No. 112 deals with the post-ballot clause 16, the amendment refers us back to the period before the ballot. It would mean that formal proposals, as defined in clause 16, would need to be prepared two months before a ballot. I am sure that that is a desirable position in which to put school boards.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was quite in order when he strayed into the topic of funding. He identified a hole in the Bill which we shall need to plug. Although the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said that there was a problem about funding, when my hon. Friend asked a question and when I looked at the Bill, I realised that it contains no specific, clear guidance on funding of the proposals. The hon. Gentleman said that although it should not be a problem for school boards to arrange for the funding, they might, in theory, be challenged as to their legal rights to do so by an education authority or another interested party. I am happy to tell my hon. Friend that I shall table an amendment at a later stage to make the position on funding absolutely clear. He touched on an important point which had not occurred to me or my advisers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the problem of funding applies to clause 16 and the powers of the school board to draw up proposals, not so much after a ballot as before? Does the problem apply with or without my amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill makes clear provisions regarding the funding of the ballot. The funding will come from the Secretary of State. The Bill assumes that the existing legislation in respect of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 will provide the school board with the funds and resources necessary to take the matter forward. Now that the point has been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North, I am advised that for the sake of clarity, it would be sensible to table amendments that would make it clear that the boards of management can bring forward such proposals. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North for having brought up what is essentially a tidying-up point, but nevertheless important.<br><br>
My hon. Friends and also Opposition Members made much play on the importance of information being provided to parents before they took a decision on the ballot. There is no difference of view between members of the Committee on that point. It is important that parents make an informed choice. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) quoted from the Education Reform Act 1988. I do not want to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
anticipate future deliberations, but the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has tabled amendment No. 108 to schedule 3 which would insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"about the consequences for the school of acquisition of self-governing status as may reasonably be expected to enable him to form a proper judgement as to whether such status should be sought for the school.".</p></blockquote>
That would probably meet the requests from my hon. Friends and from Opposition Members to ensure that proper information is available to parents in reaching a conclusion.<br><br>
The provisions in schedule 3 seem to meet the point about information, whereas the amendments under discussion deal with providing the formal proposal document. I am not sure that that would be valuable to parents as much of it would be technical or contain information that they know already. The key is that parents should have information. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood asked me to provide a list. To specify information that is necessary for people to make a decision—as the later amendment does—is better than producing a list, as we may leave out something from a list that may be in that category. That information will be circulated with the ballot paper. Therefore, when parents receive their ballot papers, they will also receive information about the board of management's proposals. The matters on which they would wish reassurance have formed much of the Committee's deliberations, such as the issue of planned admissions policy.<br><br>
I find it difficult to accept that a school board seeking self-governing status would not go out and sell its case. The board would be interested in a successful ballot result and in gaining support for that. It would want to put forward its arguments as convincingly as possible. I accept that, for the same reason, the board may not wish to emphasise certain aspects. Schedule 3(4) provides that each person eligible to vote has to be given such information as may be prescribed in regulations. That must include information about the ballot and the procedure for acquiring self-governing status.<br><br>
The regulations could also appropriately require that some approved digest of the legal provisions for self-governing schools was circulated, and could possibly also require the boards to include anything else that they considered that voters needed to know to make a reasonable judgment, in line with the proposals in amendment No. 108. I am happy to give an undertaking to my hon. Friends and Opposition Members that the regulations will reflect the importance of providing information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he will accept amendment No. 108? If so, will the information
<br><blockquote><p>"as may reasonably be expected to enable him to form a proper judgement"</p></blockquote>
include the type of information contained in clause 16(3)(a) to (e)—the essential proposals regarding the constitution of the board of management and the policies on admissions and on any special emphasis?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
If the information referred to in amendment No. 108 will constitute such information, why not simply state that as clearly as possible? If the school board is expected to produce such proposals within a month after the ballot, surely it can reasonably be expected to produce them before the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With due respect to the hon. Gentleman, I thought that I had made that point in response to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, who said that it would be helpful if I outlined the information that parents should have available. The hon. Gentleman has now touched on some aspects of that information. Rather than write a list of what parents need to know, a general test, such as that embraced in amendment No. 108, which we shall reach later, may suffice. I think that I may be called to order if I express a view on the merits of that amendment, but I have clearly shown my wish that as much information as is necessary for parents to form a sensible judgment be provided with the ballot paper.<br><br>
As Opposition Members have tabled amendment No. 108, they must think that its wording is adequate for that purpose. I do not suggest for a moment that they are wrong: amendment No. 108 seems to meet the requirements of the hon. Member for Western Isles. He has argued for the proposals themselves to be circulated, but those proposals will be in a technical document sent to the Secretary of State on which he needs to form a judgment. The proposals will be subject to amendment by the Secretary of State and if they had been endorsed in a ballot, that would create difficulties in the procedure and in the assurances that I have given about the Secretary of State having the final say. I know that the Committee put considerable emphasis on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister clearly sets great store by amendment No. 108, but it refers to schedule 3, paragraph 4(a)(ii), which deals with a fresh ballot and does not relate to the initial ballot. Will the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
Minister make it clear that if he accepts amendment No. 108, he will apply it to all ballots and not only to a fresh ballot?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing amendment No. 108. Furthermore, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of paragraph 4(a)(ii) of schedule 3, which provides that each person who is eligible to vote be given such information as may be prescribed in regulations. The regulations will provide the opportunity to do so.<br><br>
For all those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Western Isles will withdraw his amendment so that we can consider the matter further when we reach amendment No. 108.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support of Conservative Members on the principle of the amendments, but there are still questions to be asked about the Minister's response, particularly to questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).<br><br>
We need a definition of "reasonable", and to know whether it would include the provisions in amendments Nos. 94 and 112. I realise that the Minister cannot, at this stage, give a commitment on amendment No. 108, but I am willing to withdraw my amendment with the proviso that we shall consider carefully what the Minister says when we reach amendment No. 108. If his reply is not satisfactory, we can raise the matter on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
The amendment involves an important principle. Parents should have the information before they vote.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
