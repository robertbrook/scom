	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is understandable that you cannot distinguish between myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) after being up throughout the night, Mr. Martin. I am sure that, like me, you wish to extend a welcome to those hon. Members who gave up the ghost and disappeared during the night. The hon. Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and for Hexham (Mr. Amos) were last seen disappearing over Westminster bridge and we welcome them back. We give a special welcome to the day shift in the persons of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the other Ministers who missed our long debate last night. I shall put them in the picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been debating Government amendment No. 186. I tried to follow closely what the Minister said between 6 and 7 o'clock this morning. As I understand it, he went through schedule 7 and said that if each paragraph is considered in turn it becomes clear that the phrase that the amendment seeks to delete is redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1 gives the Secretary of State the power to appoint "the prescribed body" that will carry out the electoral arrangements. We know from an earlier debate that the prescribed body will be the Electoral Reform Society. Will the Minister confirm that the society is the only prescribed body not only for the ballot on opting-out but for the ballot on changing a school's characteristics once it has opted out? The Government have not made such a commitment and it will be interesting to hear Secretary of State or the Minister say whether they wish that to happen. I see that the Minister is checking with his civil servants and it is an important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of whether the Secretary of State appoints the Electoral Reform Society, the prescribed body will have to follow closely the guidance issued by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and whatever
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1040</span>
ballot procedure it sets up will be under his control. Paragraph 3 says that there must be
	<br><q><p>"a secret postal ballot of… parents of children for the time being in attendance at the school".</p></q>
Paragraph 4 lays down in some detail the information to be supplied to parents who take part in a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On paragraph 5, to which the Government amendment refers, the Minister argued that in view of the opening words:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Schedule"</p></q>
the words:
	<br><q><p>"and to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained"</p></q>
are redundant. He argued that as the schedule specified that the matter was under the control of the Secretary of State, who prescribed how the ballot was implemented in the first place, the Secretary of State's consent was unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister stands by his argument, he must justify why paragraph 5 retains the words:
	<br><q><p>"the arrangements shall be such as the board thinks fit."</p></q>
The arrangements are already under the complete control of the Secretary of State for Scotland so the board will have no freedom to make arangements as it thinks fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that as the Secretary of State for Scotland will lay down clear guidelines and specify the arrangements, his consent is unnecessary. I do not see what scope the board of management has to make arrangements as it thinks fit, unless the Minister can describe additional arrangements that a board of management may implement. Can it make arrangements other than those that the Secretary of State will prescribe through regulations and through instructions to the prescribed body, be it the Electoral Reform Society or any other organisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment appears fairly innocuous, at first glance, but when the Minister tries to justify it he raises questions about why other parts of the schedule are necessary. I think that the Minister would claim that the amendment will tidy up the schedule. A flood of amendments have been tabled to tidy up the Bill's loose drafting, which suggests that it was put together hurriedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is being rushed through Committee. We had to spend all night debating it because the Government are determined to clock up hours to justify the guillotine that they will no doubt try to introduce on the Floor of the House next week. I have sat silent in Committee for many hours waiting for an opportunity to intervene. I have never sought to filibuster or to delay the Committee. However, I am keen to ensure that all amendments, including Government amendments, are given full and detailed examination by hon. Members, who should fulfil their roles as Members of Parliament by properly scrutinising Government and Opposition amendments and the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking forward to the Minister's explanation about why it is necessary to delete the words:
	<br><q><p>"to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained"</p></q>
but to leave the provision that
	<br><q><p>"the arrangements shall be such as the board thinks fit."</p></q>
That does not tie up, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will agree, I, too, spent a lot of time in Committee last night. I was not filibustering, but several times when I was about to speak the Government closed the debate. There were several matters that we wished to take further, but time and again the Government closed the debate rather than let us air the issues fully. When we managed to do so we were threatened by Conservative Members, who asked why we were discussing the Bill in Committee, which is our proper duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Throughout the night we have heard repetition. From time to time you had to draw attention to the fact that Members were not speaking to the amendment. I suggest that the utterances that we have just heard are not related to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Once again I must call on hon. Members to restrict their remarks to the amendment before us, which is amendment No. 186.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to deflect the criticism that I knew would come from the Conservative Benches, as Conservative Members asked why we are debating these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 27 was supposed to be a purely technical provision of no consequence. The record will show that the more detailed analysis we made of it— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am explaining my reason for wondering why on earth the amendment was tabled. I accept that it seems pretty innocuous, but the more we looked at other innocuous clauses and Government amendments the more we realised that the Minister was confused. When we discussed our amendments the Minister was confused about his advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's description is a travesty of what happened. Opposition Members have continued to debate although the Minister has accepted an amendment, or they have debated unnecessarily, so the record will show that the hon. Gentleman is now talking utter nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman. First he raises a point of order and says that I am not debating the amendment, then he raises a spurious and bogus point of order that is unrelated to the amendment, which proposes to delete the words
	<br><q><p>"and to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained"</p></q>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) complains that I am not speaking to the amendment and then comes up with a red herring. He should try to concentrate on the amendment. I will not be pushed off course or taken down the wrong tracks. Previous amendments are finished with and you, Mr. Martin, would rule us out of order if we reintroduce them. For the hon. Gentleman to try to reintroduce them into the debate now represents a scurrilous abuse of the Committee. He is trying to filibuster again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1042</span>
Amendment No. 186 proposes the deletion of the words:
	<br><q><p>"and to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained".</p></q>
I am pleased about the amendment which would remove the Secretary of State's power. The Bill is replete with powers for the Secretary of State so I welcome any amendment that would remove them. The Minister has explained that paragraph 2 of the schedule gives the Secretary of State such powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the point. I agree about the principle of the Secretary of State having as little involvement as possible. However, I am not entirely convinced. If the board of management does not have to seek the consent of the Secretary of State, how will anyone know that it is fulfilling the conditions in paragraphs 1 to 5. Is there any way of safeguarding the rights of pupils and parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's first point. Perhaps she will develop that later as I did not appreciate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a safeguard in the system, so the Secretary of State would not necessarily be required to ensure that the board of management carried out its duties. If the duties were enshrined in legislation, parents could sue the board of management if they could prove that it had not fulfilled its duties properly, under the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. Perhaps there is a slightly grey area of interpretation. Although I was willing to accept the Minister's assurances, I am not now so sure after hearing my hon. Friend's contributions. The Minister rightly said that he could delete from the schedule the words of paragraph 2:
	<br><q><p>"The arrangements shall accord with such guidance as the Secretary of State may from time to time publish for the purposes of this Schedule."</p></q>
That being so, the phrase in paragraph 5
	<br><q><p>"and to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained"</p></q>
is redundant. I was prepared to accept the Minister's assurance because if the arrangements are to accord with guidance, but do not, the board of management will be open to challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right on this issue, but as we have discovered that there are many grey areas of legal dispute. This might be another that we shall not know about until there is a challenge on a legal issue. My hon. Friends were right to raise this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, an apparently innocuous amendment is introduced by the Minister, and again, when we discuss it we seem to uncover yet more problems. We are justified in examining each amendment and clause in great detail. If we do not, we shall fail in our duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. If we do not subject the legislative proposals to intense scrutiny, who knows what sort of dog's breakfast might eventually be presented to the House and become law? The vast majority of Conservative Members who will drift through the Lobby on that future night
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1043</span>
will not have read a word of the Bill. We shall not be subjecting the proposals to any scrutiny, let alone intensive scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was drawn up by the Minister with his army of civil servants. We are now discussing his amendment. I hope that we will not hear abusive remarks and threats of the sort that we heard earlier from Tory Back Benchers, who said that if we did not desist, they would refuse their Minister's direction and vote against him. I hope that they will conduct themselves more reasonably now that they have had a little rest and are refreshed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), on the principle that the Secretary of State should have as little involvement in such matters as possible because that is automatically a good thing. Nevertheless, if no notification is given to the Secretary of State, how will anyone know that the conditions in paragraphs 1 to 5 had been fulfilled properly? It is all very well for my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) to argue that people who had been harmed by a board's failure may sue, but can we be sure of that? Does the Bill provide that right? If it does, what would be the cost, and would legal aid be granted? Would there be other remedies? The Minister has yet to tell us what they would be. Rather than have to remedy matters after the event, would it not be better to write safeguards into the Bill so that the wrong could not occur?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So often in life we agree with a principle, but practical realities point us in another direction. Sometimes it is difficult to choose between principle and practicality. Here we have the principle that the Secretary of State should have as little as possible to do with a board of management's failure to act properly, but there is the practical reality that perhaps a civil servant in the Secretary of State's office could check to see that all was done according to plan. No doubt the Minister, who has by now had time to be briefed, will explain why the Bill was so drafted and the purpose of his amendment. I hope that he will not reply that it is a mere technical detail because we have uncovered another issue of principle that is far more than a technical detail. The Opposition do not know how to vote; we still seek information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to think that we may vote against the amendment, having heard that convincing contribution from my hon. Friend. I was of a mind to accept the Minister's reassurances on paragraph 2, but, the more I think about them, the less I am inclined to do so. I am grateful to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply honoured by my hon. Friend's confidence in my judgment. I am not so egotistic as to think that I must be right. I am willing to listen to discussions and hear other views before making up my mind. I thought it important that the point that I raised should be taken into account and included in the balance. I, too, could be persuaded otherwise if I was convinced that other arguments outweighed mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1044</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the two points that have been raised so far. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) read 	<i>The Scotsman</i> this morning. If she had, she would not have made her speech. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is quoted as saying that his decision to prolong the debates:
	<br><q><p>"was intended to prevent the Government's setting the agenda so that the bill could be curtailed or guillotined later, at a point convenient to Ministers".</p></q>
So all the protestations of the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) about wanting to go into the issues that are involved in what is a purely technical amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. What has the article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> on Labour's broad strategy to do with the point that we have been making?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I allowed hon. Members to lead into the amendment, and I think that I must allow the Minister a lead-in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin. The use made by the hon. Member for Maryhill of the word "strategy" is something of an exaggeration. Strategy implies a plan, and if there is a plan, the Opposition must have an enormous computer to deal with all the variables that have come up during the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevance of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> to this debate is that I do not understand why a perfectly sensible technical amendment, which I almost regret moving, to tidy up the Bill has provoked such an amount of interest among Opposition Members. The answer is, I think, clear. The hon. Member for Fife, Central is quoted in the press as saying that he has decided to prolong the debate—not to have a more informed debate, but "to prolong" it. That is the reason for the ridiculous questions that are being asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central is also quoted in the article as saying:
	<br><q><p>"The Government had been attempting to catch out Labour on an area of the bill where there were few amendments down … But we're not going to fall for something as elementary as that".</p></q>
So the reason why we have sat up all night without making any progress—my hon. Friends are puzzled by debates of this nature—is that the Opposition are so incompetent that they have not tabled amendments to later clauses and wish to keep us here discussing the early clauses in their desire to frustrate progress. That is their strategy, as the hon. Member for Maryhill says. We are not taken in by the questions that are being asked. We are debating a perfectly straightforward technical amendment which simply seeks to ensure that the position of the Secretary of State is clear and to remove an ambiguity, as the hon. Member for Fife, Central and the hon. Lady are perfectly aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked two questions. The first was about the conflict: how could the details be left to the board, with the Secretary of State issuing guidance? The answer is simple. The Secretary of State will provide guidance on the principles to be followed by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1045</span>
board, and subject to that guidance, it will be for the board to decide the details of the administration of that guidance. There is no conflict there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose it does not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other question that I was asked has just been repeated by the hon. Member for Ladyhill: how can we ensure that the board of management will fulfil its prescribed conditions? There will be a legal obligation on the board, and any contravention of that legal obligation will be subject to challenge in the courts. Someone asked—I am not quite sure who it was—what would happen if the Secretary of State acted unreasonably. Were that to happen, a judicial review would be competent, and legal aid would be available for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the guidance to be provided by the Secretary of State would be on the principles that would govern the ballot. I would have thought that the principle governing a ballot was simple: one member, one parent, one vote. The relevant principles are contained in schedule 7(4). What principles other than those in paragraph 4 will the Secretary of State provide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All sorts of detailed considerations are involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman presses me to give examples, which I think is a little unfair, there is the interval of time that should elapse between ballot papers being issued and the date by which they must be received. It would be plainly daft to try to anticipate and write into primary legislation all the questions that might arise. That is why the schedule enables the Secretary of State to provide guidance of that sort, and how that guidance is put into effect is obviously a matter for the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difficulty with the amendment. It is a tidying-up amendment. Opposition Members are wasting the Committee's time for reasons which they have declared in advance. They must have talked to the press more than 12 hours ago, and it is quite disgraceful for them to seek to frustrate debate on a Bill of such importance, when many people in Scotland are following our debates carefully. The Opposition first treated the Committee as though it were a press conference; now they are treating it as some sort of game in which they compete for dominance as to who determines the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is splitting hairs. I meant, of course, that it was I who said anything of any substance about the amendment. We have had a useful little discussion. The Minister cannot possibly say that I have treated the Committee as a press conference or as a game, because I have tried to be constructive and reasonable in all the suggestions that I have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The division of functions hinted at in paragraph 5 between the Secretary of State and the board of management is, in my view, rather odd. It does not stop there, because there is a further division of functions down to the prescribed body that will embody the machinery of conducting the ballot. However, the matter might be better dealt with in the stand part debate on schedule 7, provided that we are allowed to have such a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the schedule, as amended, be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we spend time on schedule 7 and its relationship with schedule 3 before we agree to it. They are two sister schedules— or two brother schedules, if I am not to be sexist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two person schedules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is the best way in which to describe them. Schedule 3 deals with the ballot procedure when the school decides on self-governing status, and schedule 7 deals with the ballot procedure once a school has agreed to self-governing status and wants to decide whether the characteristics of the school should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are similarities between the two schedules, but the differences are more interesting. Will the Minister explain why there are differences in what are ostensibly two similar balloting procedures? The Minister may claim that they are exactly the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend goes deeper into the details of the schedule, will he remind Conservative Members that, during discussion of this schedule, they have defied the Minister's wishes? They demanded that there should be a vote on an amendment that we were willing to withdraw and that the Minister wanted us to withdraw because he agreed with it in principle.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps returning to the matter. I put it on the record for the hon.

Opposition Members want to make a change but, because they did not withdraw the amendment when the offer was made, there was no opportunity to reconsider the matter. I am content with the action taken by my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister wants to contribute to the debate and he tried to do so in that intervention. My recollection of what took place is different from his. That is not surprising as the Minister is probably embarrassed at what happened during the night. He will do anything to cover up the severe embarrassment inflicted on him by his hon. Friends. The Opposition were prepared to withdraw the amendment to allow the Minister to reconsider but, in the event, the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) shouted that Conservative Back Benchers would defeat the amendment because they were fed up with being kept up all night by the Opposition. In reality, the Government Whip has the power to move the closure whenever he chooses. He has not done so. If there is filibustering, it is by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would give way to the hon. Gentleman if he had been here throughout our proceedings but he went missing halfway through the night. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes peered anxiously out of the window to catch a glimpse of him as he sped across Westminster bridge to wherever he went for four or five hours. He may have taken too liberally the refreshments provided by the Government Whip in the Room next door. He cannot make a conribution to this discussion because he was not here and does not know what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I try to speak I am constantly interrupted, taken off my course and not permitted to concentrate on the matter before the Committee. My hon. Friends want to debate the Bill rather than to indulge in the boyish, girlish or personish games that characterise Conservative interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my comparison of schedules 7 and 3 and our discussion of whether that comparison should affect the Committee's decision to agree to schedule 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My judgment may be flawed, as it is now more than 26 hours since I was last in bed, but I believe that paragraphs (1) and (2) are the same in both schedules, but there is a substantial difference in paragraph (3) which states:
	<br><q><p>"The ballot shall be a secret postal ballot of all parents of pupils for the time being in attendance at the school and any question as to whether a person is such a parent shall be determined by the school board."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1048</span>
It shares that sentence with schedule 7. Schedule 3(3) continues:
	<br><q><p>"but on being requested to do so by the school board the education authority shall, for the purposes of the ballot, provide the board with a copy of the current list maintained by the authority, in respect of the school, under paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the 1988 Act (list of names of parents of pupils in attendance)."</p></q>
That is not required under schedule 7 because it has already been provided by the education authority to the school board. The board of management possesses it so there is no need for it to be provided again. That is how I understand it although I believe that the Government suggested that the school boards or boards of management should request information from education authorities that they already possessed. The Minister should clarify the matter when he replies to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (4) starts in the same way, although its phraseology is different. Schedule 3 states:
	<br><q><p>"each person who is eligible to vote in the ballot is—(a) given such information, including (without prejudice to the generality of this paragraph) information".</p></q>
The phrase
	<br><q><p>"without prejudice to the generality of this paragraph"</p></q>
is not in schedule 7. Will the Minister explain why? It may be important. I do not know because I have no legal training. The Minister has the backing of three experts who have provided a tremendous service throughout the evening. No doubt they will give him the answer now so that he can explain why it is in schedule 3 but not in schedule 7, which deals with the same procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3(4) states that people eligible to vote shall receive information:
	<br><q><p>"about the ballot and about the procedure for the acquisition of self-governing status".</p></q>
In schedule 7, they are only to be given information about the ballot as may be prescribed. Why are they not to be given information on the procedure for changing the characteristics? Why is it necessary to give information about the procedure to decide whether to opt out of local authority control but not about the procedure for deciding whether to change the major characteristics of the school? There is a fundamental difference between the two schedules. A decision by the board of management and parents to change the characteristics of the school is far more momentous than the decision to opt out of education authority control and to be directly funded by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Why are parents to be given information before they take that more minor decision but not before they take the important decision to change the characteristics of the school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 7 should state that people should be given information on the procedure for changing the characteristics of the school, and on the full implications of those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the three amendments that the Minister accepted in principle provided that people who are eligible to vote should know the implications of the vote on the school and on the children who attend that school. The Minister was prepared to consider the amendment and to return to the Committee to suggest how that might be achieved, but he was prevented from doing so by a rebellion from his Back Benchers who voted against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1049</span>
Conservative Members prevented the Minister from making a suggestion that would put Schedule 7 more in line with the provisions in Schedule 3. Schedule 3(5) states:
	<br><q><p>"Before the ballot the school board shall make available, for inspection (at all reasonable times and free of charge), to every person employed to work at the school a document containing the information given under paragraph 4(a) above."</p></q>
Basically that is a document which will be made available to teaching and non-teaching staff in schools to keep them fully informed about any suggestion of the school opting out of education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have searched Schedule 7 and can find no reference to a board of management requirement to provide a document for public inspection by its teaching and non-teaching staff. Again, our amendment sought a requirement for consultation with teaching and non-teaching staff in self-governing schools which tried to change their characteristics. However, the amendment was defeated by a Government Back Bench rebellion in defiance of the Minister. Therefore, we must find out what the Government are suggesting in Schedule 7 and compare it with the Schedule 3, which will be included in the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it right to provide information for teaching and non-teaching staff about proposals to opt out of education authority control but not right to provide the equivalent information about a self-governing school which is making a decision to change its characteristics? That kind of decision is far more important. It may contain far more implications for teaching and non-teaching staff than the decision simply to move from local authority control to direct control by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are substantial differences between Schedule 7 and Schedule 6 and I shall be interested to hear from the Minister why those differences exist. I shall want a full explanation before I am prepared to accept that Schedule 7 should stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on Schedule 7(4)(c) which says that those who are eligible to vote should be:
	<br><q><p>"given an opportunity to do so by being provided timeously with a ballot paper which sets out the question as to whether the change sought should be made and invites him to vote 'yes' or 'no' to that question."</p></q>
It is interesting to note that in Schedule 7 the form of a question must be spelt out and answered by a simple "yes" or "no"—black or white, right or wrong. That is the kind of referendum which the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is keen to put to the Scottish people on separation from the United Kingdom or retention within the United Kingdom Parliament as it now stands. That is a prejudiced way in which to seek a point of view from people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know exactly how the question will be framed when a proposal is made to change the characteristics of a school. For example, it might be suggested that a school should change from one denomination to another. Perhaps it will change from a Catholic school to a non-Catholic school; from a non-Catholic school to a Catholic school; from a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1050</span>
Catholic school to a Moslem school, or whatever. How will the question be framed for that ballot?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to note the division of opinion that existed on the Government Benches about what was intended in terms of the change of denomination status for schools in Schedule 7, and the clause. I remember clearly that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was sure that the intention was to allow schools to divide along racial and religious lines to provide, for example, Islamic schools and Moslem schools. The hon. Gentleman was interrupted by his hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) who simply said, if a substantial section of any school came from a particular ethnic or religious background the characteristic of the school would have to reflect that. That suggested a multicultural, multireligious approach to school provisions. That is different from the monocultural, monoreligious approach suggested by the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes. How will the Government phrase the question for parents? Will it be the straightforward question, "Do you want your school to become an Islamic school? Vote 'yes' or 'no'"? The Committee needs to know the answer before it can give the nod to Schedule 7(4)(c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same could be true of single-sex schools if it is suggested that a school should change from mixed sex to single sex or, indeed, vice versa. How will the question be framed and will it be legal? I believe that it is illegal under existing law to discriminate against people in terms of racial origin or sex orientation. However, it does not seem to be illegal to refuse people access to educational provision which is meant to represent open access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are forever telling us that access to self-governing schools will be completely open. However, it appears that it will not be completely open, as it will be free for self-governing schools to refuse access to someone on the grounds that they are a man, woman, boy or girl, in other words on the grounds of sexual orientation. The Minister seems to be suggesting that that is legal. If it is legal, how will the question be framed? Will it ask, "Do you agree to exclude all boys from the school?" or "Do you agree to exclude all girls from the school?" or, perhaps, it will be phrased in another way by using the word "include"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Phraseology is important because we can get any answer we want by cleverly phrasing a question. That is why it is important for the Minister to explain exactly how a question which seeks to change a school's characteristics will be phrased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from earlier debates that the Minister and his hon. Friends are keen to move back to a system of selective schools by which people are allowed into a school on the basis of their academic ability only. How will that be achieved? A simple question will not be asked such as, "Do you agree to exclude any person from this school who is below a certain IQ level?" Or, "Do you agree to include any person in this school above a certain IQ level? Answer 'yes' or 'no'". Those are absurd, stupid questions. However, they are the only ones the hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1051</span>
can interpret as likely to be asked under the terms of Schedule 7(4)(c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I looked at paragraph (4)(c) I wondered how the Government would decide that pupils at primary 7 level could enter a secondary school. How will they assess the academic ability of primary school children? The Minister told the Committee several times that the school board system, and the system of national testing which will be introduced, will retain complete confidentiality about the results pupils achieve under the national test at primary 4 and 7 levels. Those results are simply for the parents and the child. Therefore, how will a self-governing school make a judgment about a child? Is the Minister saying that parents who apply for their child to go to a self-governing school which selects on the basis of academic ability will have to own up about the results of the national testing at primary 4 or primary 7 levels? Will parents have to reveal to other sources information that was previously said to be confidential to them and their child? The provisions in Schedule 7 lead me to believe that that information will not be completely confidential. Parents and children will have to disclose the results of the national testing if a child is to gain access to a school that changes its characteristic to one that selects on the basis of academic ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the vexed question of special education. The Minister has tried to make commitments, particularly to the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), to the extent that he said that the question of provision for special education being reduced would never arise. The only question is whether provision for special education should be increased under clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to be saying that the only basis on which opted-out schools can change the special education provisions is through the ballot procedure under clause 28 and schedule 7. It seems weird to insist that the whole school must be balloted before provision can be made for one or two children who require special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same article in the 	<i>Times Scottish Education Supplement,</i> in which the Minister admitted that the Bill was a shambles, states:
	<br><q><p>"The Minister had given a commitment to Mrs. Margaret Ewing … that opted-out schools would be encouraged to take a 'proactive role' after concern that they would neglect children with special needs. Special schools will also be able to opt out."</p></q>
The Minister seems to be saying that schools that opt out will be encouraged to attract children who require special education. Even if they succeed in attracting only one such child, they will have to go through the whole procedure outlined in clause 28 and schedule 7, which is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his colleagues are keen on referring to the Strathclyde region and to Dr. Dalcolm Green in particular, whom they regard as an ally. I fail to see how they can regard him as an ally. He is a member of the Labour party and an ally of this side of the Committee. When he spoke about opted-out schools actively seeking children with special educational needs and going through the whole ballot procedure, Dr. Green argued that special schools should remain under local authority control. The article again quotes him as saying:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1052</span>
	<br><q><p>"Local authorities play a vital role in providing qualified and specialist staff, co-ordinating transport and domestic arrangements, supplying a wide range of interdisciplinary support agencies and operating as an effective network across Scotland to admit children to the school most appropriate to a child's need."</p></q>
The Minister should not suggest that a self-governing school could compete with such provision. It is nonsensical for him to try to wriggle out of his dilemma by making commitments that have no meaning in the real world. He is trying to slip through this part of the Bill by saying that he is not trying to offend anyone concerned with special education, but he has not convinced me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to interrupt or distract my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point.

Is the schedule necessary, given some of the Minister's remarks at a previous sitting?

I was trying to deal with the Minister's earlier comments. He appeared to suggest that the whole procedure set out in schedule 7 would be redundant.

be irrelevant because the Secretary of State for Scotland could take the decision to change the characteristics of a school. He would have that power under clause 2(2). The notes on clause 2 state:
	<br><q><p>"Subsection (2) provides for the Secretary of State by order to make or vary the scheme of government of a self-governing school, but adds the qualification that if any variation of the scheme of government would affect the characteristics of the school as listed under clause 16(4), it should be made in accordance with the procedure for such a change as provided for under clause 28(9)."</p></q>
On clause 29, the notes state:
	<br><q><p>"Subsection (9) requires the Secretary of State to give effect to any approved proposals by amending the scheme of government for the school under the powers in clause 2(2)."</p></q>
By approved proposals, the notes mean those approved under the procedure outlined in schedule 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister does not know what he is talking about. He made ludicrous statements which led me to believe that the ballot procedure would be redundant. When I studied the notes on clauses, I saw that it was the Minister who should be made redundant. Perhaps the time that he has been on the Front Bench is beginning to affect his judgment. I hope not because we are considering important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the general powers that a board of management may have under clause 7(1). He suggested that the powers of that subsection would have allowed a board of management to take the decision to change the characteristics of a school if one of the earlier amendments had been accepted. The notes on clause 7 state:
	<br><q><p>"Subsection (1) requires the board of management to manage the school and to provide suitable and efficient education at it. To do this they would have the power to do anything which they regard as necessary or convenient so long as they do not contravene."</p></q>
That wide power given to the board of management by clause 7 is restricted by schedule 1, which deals with the way in which the board exercises its functions, including that of the general power. Paragraph 2(a) of Part II of Schedule 1 provides
	<br><q><p>"that the board of management shall so exercise their functions as to ensure that the school continues to conform to the description for the time being so contained;"</p></q>
That general power would not allow the board of management to take the decision to change the characteristics of a school without undertaking a ballot. Therefore, on balance, schedule 7 and the ballot procedure that it describes should remain part of the bill, but they should only remain if the Minister clarifies the issues that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister has got it badly wrong twice? He has got it wrong on the powers of the boards of management to change the characteristics of a school without holding a ballot and on the ability of opted-out schools in England and Wales to change the character of religious education by changing it from being predominantly Christian. The Minister understands neither the ins and outs of the English legislation nor those of the Scottish Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's criticism of the Minister is justified. For once, I shall defend the Minister. It has to be acknowledged that the Minister is tired and is making mistakes. The responsibility
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1056</span>
for that lies with the Government Whip who has made the Committee sit for approaching 24 hours without proper breaks. It is not surprising that the Minister has made misjudgments and made statements that bear no relation to the provisions of the Bill. I have sympathy for the Minister because I sometimes make mistakes, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman take the opportunity to prove to the Committee that he sometimes makes mistakes? Will he explain which remarks of mine constitute mistakes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows how ludicrous it is to deal with these issues in a session that will last for 24 hours. For the past 15 minutes, I have explained where the Minister went wrong. He obviously was not listening. He was talking to his officials and other members of the Committee. He paid no attention to the points that I made about clause 2(2), the powers of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister's references to the powers of the boards of management under clause 7(7) and how they would be restricted by schedule 1. It is not my fault that the Minister did not listen. However, I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, would bring me to order if I repeated that 15-minute long contribution and prevented the Committee from further considering the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is awake enough to answer the points that I have raised. They relate to a fundamental part of the procedure which is outlined in clause 28, which attempts to give some democratic integrity to the affair by insisting on a ballot. We believe that there should be a ballot, but we want the procedure to be as strong as that which is set out in schedule 3. That does not seem to be the position now with schedule 7, and I hope that the Minister will tell us why that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East was right when he said that the schedule is an important part of the democratic procedures that are set out in the Bill, which we wish to see work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall air my worries about the different steps that are involved in schedule 7, but I hope I am not subject to the endless interruptions that my hon. Friend suffered. They had nothing to do with the schedule. I shall concentrate on the content of the schedule and shall not talk about the events of last night. I hope that Conservative Members will do that as well and not wander into other realms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1 of the schedule 7 states:
	<br><q><p>"The board of management of the school shall secure that all necessary arrangements for the ballot are made by such body as may be prescribed".</p></q>
The obvious question arises. What will happen if someone does not receive a ballot paper? The Minister has said that if anything goes wrong with the procedure an aggrieved party can take steps about it. That party may even receive legal aid to take action. In real life, will many parents go to such lengths? They may not care much about it considering all the other worries that they have on their minds. This solution is like taking a hammer to crack a nut. Parents can either do nothing or take the prescribed

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1057</span>
body to court. There should be a speedy, cheap and easy remedy rather than do nothing or consult a lawyer with all the expense, bother and hassle that that involves. The Minister has failed to consider the democratic process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 states:
	<br><q><p>"The arrangements shall accord with such guidance as the Secretary of State may from time to time publish for the purposes of this Schedule."</p></q>
We assume, as it is common sense, that the Secretary of State will send copies of such guidance to each school involved, but we have not been told that. That might create difficulties. We live in the real world and not some ideal world in the Minister's imagination. Some schools may not receive the guidance or receive it but put it in the wrong file and generally get the records in a mess. They may not mean to be awkward or intend any ill-will, but because of everyday difficulties they may fail to carry out the guidance. Has the Minister thought through that problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These may seem unreasonable, pernickety, nitpicking questions, but what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. When trade unions were compelled by legislation to ballot their members on whether to have a political levy they had to deal with such minor problems. They had to ensure that every member received a copy of the ballot paper and every rule was carried out to the letter or a member made a great fuss, claimed that the ballot had not been carried out fairly and created loads of publicity to attack the union. We should learn lessons from that experience and avoid such difficulties in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 deals with an aspect that I mentioned previously to the Minister. I am still struck by the absurdity of it. It says:
	<br><q><p>"any question of whether a person is such a parent"—</p></q>
a parent entitled to vote—
	<br><q><p>"shall be determined by the board."</p></q>
I appeal to the logic and common sense of the Committee. We have been up all night and our brains may not be fresh, but we should accept that a person is either eligible to vote or not. It should not depend on someone else's opinion. Either that person has a child at the school or he does not. I have tried to point that out to the Minister but he has not understood it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am concerned about this paragraph. What are its implications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There might be two consequences: either someone who ought to have a vote will be excluded, or someone who ought not to have a vote will be included. It is easy to determine from the register of pupils at the school which parents are eligible. That is fact, not opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I became a Member of Parliament, I realised that I would be engaged in endless political debate with Conservative Members. I knew that I would be involved in exchanging opinions for long periods of time, but I did not expect to have to deal with basic logic. Descartes said, "Cogito ergo sum.", meaning, "I think, therefore I am." Volumes have been written about the proof of a person's existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1058</span>

I was saying that we cannot determine that a person exists because it is someone's opinion that he exists. The good Bishop Berkeley argued that persons existed because they were seen in the eyes of God.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It relates to paragraph 3, which states how it shall be determined whether a person is a parent who is eligible to vote. I was saying that it was a matter of fact whether or not that person existed. Even the opinion of members of an august body as members of a school board is irrelevant. The person either exists or does not exist. I was trying to explain that concept to Conservative Members, who were somewhat sceptical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3 states

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1059</span>
That depends on what is meant by "a parent" and how that is determined by the board. A Wittgensteinian analysis of whether or not something exists depends on the use of the words. Perhaps that is a better interpretation than that of Bishop Berkeley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitated to bring Wittgenstein into the argument, because it is difficult enough with Bishop Berkeley and Descartes without attempting to give a short tutorial in the ideals of Wittgenstein. Perhaps A H Ayer would be easier to comprehend. He pointed out something that might appeal to people's common sense: when we say that something is good, we mean "Hooray for that", and when we say that something is bad, we mean "Boo to that." But Ayer realised that it was idle to argue that something existed merely because that was someone else's opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of plain fact whether a particular parent has the right to vote in the ballot. The opinion of others, no matter how worthy or exalted they may be, is beside the point. The school board has only to go through the school register, determine which pupils are at the school and find out who are the relevant parents. That may not be easy as it seems, because parents become divorced or separated and the child might live with its grandmother. Nevertheless, it is all a matter of fact and not opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having tried to clarify the thinking of Conservative Members, I shall move on to the rest of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier that when a body is called upon to conduct a ballot and to implement the steps described in paragraph 4(a), (b) and (c), it is not as easy as it might appear. For example, when a trade union is compelled to conduct a postal ballot at great expense, it can, despite the best will in the world, sometimes get things wrong. The union may fail to enclose all the necessary information in every envelope, not because it is trying to be deceitful but through human error. The board could fall foul of paragraph 4(a), which requires the board to
	<br><q><p>"give such information concerning the ballot as may be prescribed"</p></q>
through no ill intention. It could just be a failure to carry out a bureaucratic process with sufficient care. How can the board be sure that all parents are informed of their entitlement to vote? Sometimes parents move house and they do not necessarily notify the school. They might give a note to the child to take into school about it but the child leaves it in the bottom of his school bag for months and never delivers it. This is the stuff of real life. Conservative Members do not seem to be taking any notice of that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is even possible that some parents could accidentally not receive a ballot paper and other parents might receive two or more ballot papers. That is not a fanciful proposition. The community charge registrar has hundreds of workers at his disposal and is forming what is supposed to be a definitive register of community charge payers yet I was absolutely amazed to receive two registrations for myself and two payment books. That has happened to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1060</span>
others as the papers daily report. If an organisation of that size with all that money at its disposal can make a simple mistake like that surely a school board can be forgiven for making similar errors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those small things might go wrong just because of human error. That is one of the reasons why many parents never wanted to be bothered with all this in the first place. They were quite prepared to leave the schools to be run by the local authority. All these difficulties are not put in their path. The Minister swept aside our objections to his amendment to paragraph 5 by arguing that if parents were aggrieved they could take action through the courts and seek legal aid. That seems an extreme action to take over what could be a trivial mishap. Would Conservative Members be so unreasonable as to sue a school board for leaving out one piece of information from the envelope enclosing their ballot paper or if their ballot paper arrived three days after everyone else's? Is that likely? If the Minister was really thinking his way through this he would try to give clearer guidance on how such matters could be properly conducted so that mistakes could be rectified without any legal hassle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nub of my objections. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East outlined a number of other substantial worries too. It is perturbing that the Minister regards our efforts to get clarification as time wasting. I am glad that I have not been interrupted by foolish and time wasting questions about what went on during the night in this Committee. But that was what my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East had to endure when he made his speech. Things have calmed down now but the Conservatives have probably—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tired themselves out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are probably tired out now. I felt a bit sorry for the Minister during the night. He was a bit like someone who had taken four Alsation dogs into the House only to discover that he could not control any of them. Things have calmed down and I hope that we will be able to think our way through the problems that we have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be as brief as I can in this debate. In doing so I hope that I keep within the bounds of order. The Government Whip has already paid us the compliment of implying that we have kept within those bounds so far because he has not once attempted to move a closure motion on any of the debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend consider why the Government Whip never moved the closure motion? Was it not because he wanted us to get on to schedule 7 because it is extremely important and he wanted it to be debated in prime time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the Whip did not attempt to move a closure motion confirms that we have been in order throughout. I welcomed the Minister's assurance at the beginning of this stand part debate that there would be no guillotine. When the subject was raised he shook his head vigorously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1061</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments on procedure and what is happening in this Committee, which is, of course, all new to me as I was not present at the time. However, they do not form part of his promise to be brief in explaining his objections to schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I appreciate that you were not here when we had lengthy and detailed discussions in the night. Much hinged on the Minister's assurances. My hon. Friend thought that the Minister gave us an assurance that there would be no guillotine on this Bill. I also thought that we had been given that assurance, but he seems to be reneging on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is another place, namely the Chamber, where the hon. Member can raise questions about whether there is a guillotine on this Bill. However, there is certainly a schedule 7 to this Bill and we are having a stand part debate on it and I am sure that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) will return to his brief comments on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, Mr. Hogg. Had you been with us through the night this schedule would have a poignant quality for you. We tabled a set of amendments on it and the Minister told us that he agreed with them in principle. He asked us to withdraw our amendments, which we did, but he was then leapfrogged by his own Back-Benchers and the other amendments were lost. Fortunately there are provisions within the schedule which, if the Minister chose to interpret them in the proper way, could bring back to life the substance of some of those amendments which were unfortunately lost, contrary to our wishes and contrary to the Minister's wishes, as a result of the uncontrollable behaviour of Conservative Back-Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the record should be put right. If my recollection is correct, the Minister said that he would consider one group of amendments if they were withdrawn and quite incomprehensibly Opposition Members responded by filibustering. The Minister said that he would accept another group of amendments if—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going over past events. Possibly what he says is correct. I have no way of knowing until I read the record but I am sure that if he says those events happened, they happened. But there is no point in raking over these coals because we are past that and we are now on schedule 7. I appeal to the hon. Member for Western Isles to address himself to the schedule and not to recount what may or may not have occurred in the Committee in the night. That way we could make some progress. I am sure that he will co-operate with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that matter, I am aware of the need to make progress, but as the hon. Gentleman made an inaccurate statement, I felt the need to put the point of view of Conservative Committee Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1062</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not the custodian of the Committee's records nor of its morality. What he says is his opinion of events, it has no more authority than that. He must restrain himself from feeling the need to keep us all in order and to keep the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chair is not worried about whether the Bill makes progress; my only worry is that the conduct of the business is in order. To that end, I ask the hon. Member for Western Isles to return to and deal exclusively with schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not have mentioned the specific amendment except that I hope that the Minister will be able to interpret the wording of paragraph 4(a) of schedule 7, and reintroduce the essential substance of the amendment that he accepted in principle. Paragraph 4(a) lays down the duty of the board to secure that the prescribed body which is to undertake the ballot will:
	<br><q><p>"take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that each person who is eligible to vote in the ballot is—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) given such information concerning the ballot as may be prescribed".</p></q>
The key words are "as may be prescribed". It is open to the Secretary of State to prescribe the information given to each elector. Therefore, it should be possible now for the Secretary of State to say that some of that prescribed information will relate to the views of the teaching and non-teaching staff on the proposed changes in the school's characteristics. It seems reasonable for him to say that he accepts that prescription of information because he accepted, in principle, the validity and merit of giving such information to electors outlined in amendment No. 141. He had quibbles about technical matters, but accepted the principle. The principle could be safeguarded it the Minister said that part of the information prescribed by the Secretary of State will relate to the views of teaching and non-teaching staff. If he does not want to do so, he should either say why it would be technically inappropriate under paragraph 4(a) to give such information to electors, or he should say why he no longer sees the merit of such information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister says that a change to a schedule is worthy of his support, he does so because he is considering that change on its merits. He will not amend the Bill simply to make life easier for himself or for us. One assumes that he considers a matter on its merits and decides whether it is a worthy and deserving change to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot say, as he said a wee bit earlier, that it makes no difference whether that change is concluded. That is irrational. If it makes no difference, why did he support it in principle? Either it improves or does not improve the Bill. If it does not improve the Bill, he should not have supported it in principle, but if it does, he should have supported it and should still support it. If he supports it, he must conclude that it is an appropriate prescription for the Secretary of State, unless he can show that it is technically inappropriate. But it should not be possible to do that. Paragraph 4 (c) is very wide and should not be circumscribed by any other paragraph in the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being prompted into drawing conclusions from my reactions. It amuses me to see him take refuge in the Secretary of State's powers of prescription. He spent much time saying how wicked those powers are, but is now using them to get off the hook that Opposition Members put themselves on earlier this morning when their attempts to take out time from the Committee took precedence over the desire to improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be tempted into saying what actually happened this morning. Suffice to say that the Minister's version is entirely wrong. The Secretary of State's powers are tolerable in this case, given that the Bill specifies only that they are to be prescribed. They will not be included in the Bill because of the Back-Bench rebellion among the Minister's troops. We must then accept second best and get an assurance from the Minister now that the Secretary of State will prescribe that the information be made available to parents. I shall leave the matter there, because it stands on its own merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 2 and 3 raise a different point. Paragraph 2 refers to the guidance that the Secretary of State
	<br><q><p>"may from time to time publish for the purposes of this Schedule."</p></q>
That guidance is to boards of management on how the ballots should be conducted. We have already debated briefly the provisions that are included in such guidance and the principles that the Secretary of State can specify in paragraphs 2 and 3. The Minister suggested one example—guidance on the time in which ballot papers should be sent out to parents. That is contained in paragraph 4(c) which requires the board of management to process timeously those matters with a ballot paper that sets out the question. Such principles of guidance can easily be contained in the schedule, without having to give the Secretary of State an additional discretion. I doubt whether the Minister will accept that, as he wishes to hang on to that discretion, even though I feel that it is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State also give guidance to school boards about the conduct of ballots that they conduct to assess the merits or desirability of another school opting out? The Minister looks quizzical, but he assured us that it would be feasible for school boards of feeder primaries to conduct ballots on the merits of the school into which they feed opting out. The Minister said that that would be acceptable and even appeared to welcome the prospect. He also assured us that education authorities would provide the finance for such ballots in feeder primaries. We considered the clarification of that point a great gain, so great that I withdrew the amendment which would have achieved roughly the same effect, although not quite to the same degree as the Minister's concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State give the same guidance to school boards of feeder primaries on the conduct of ballots as he will give to boards of management? It will be helpful if he does, as the same general principles could apply in both cases. It would confirm the fact that all those ballots are on a par. As the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1064</span>
Minister said, the ballots will not determine the final decision. The Secretary of State will take the ballot results into account and weigh them along with other considerations when making his decision. Those other considerations include the views of parents in feeder primaries. Therefore, ballots in feeder primaries are as worthy of the Secretary of State's attention as ballots in schools deciding whether to opt out.

The ballots may not be about opting out but may be on whether the school should change its characteristics. That is also true of the feeder primary ballots. Given their equivalent merit, status and importance in determining parents' views on those crucial matters, it would be helpful if the Minister would say whether the Secretary of State will extend to feeder primaries the guidance for ballots that he intends to extend to opted-out schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) for his outstanding speech on schedule 7. My hon. Friend has made several outstanding contributions throughout the sitting, and constant interruptions from Conservative Members have not deflected him from his train of thought or his concentration on the matters before us. Once again, he has displayed his talents by never straying from schedule 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read the Bill, schedule 7 seemed innocuous. It did not strike me as contentious, and I did not think that we would spend much time on it. But we have learnt something overnight about even the apparently innocuous parts of the Bill, such as schedule 7. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is getting tired and is having trouble standing up to speak. I understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friends the Members for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) began to tease out the initially innocuous schedule 7, there was more to it than I first thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should have been unnecessary for me to speak to the schedule, or for my hon. Friends to do so. Even if we had to speak, it should not have been at great length.
	<br><q><p>"The Chairman's attention having been called to the fact that eight Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room and eight Members being present, the proceedings were resumed."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again the shambles on the Conservative Benches becomes apparent. This is the third time during our proceedings that they have not been quorate. There was also a shambles last night when the Minister twice lost control of his Back Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has lectured us on procedure this morning. He should concentrate on the purport of schedule 7. If he does, we shall listen attentively to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining that it was partly because of last night's shambles that I am having to speak to schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) had got it wrong, you brought me to heel. With respect, I think that the same practice should be followed in relation to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that was the point I had just made. Even if my style in addressing the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) was less disciplinarian, it should not be thought that my remarks were any less forceful in intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only too pleased to continue speaking to schedule 7. However, that incident has highlighted the problems that we have faced in trying to debate various subjects. We keep being interrupted by Conservative Members raising bogus points of order and fallacious points, so that we cannot concentrate on the matter before us. You should be grateful that you have not had to spend the evening and early morning here, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's speech is persuading me of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 7 relates to clause 28, which is one of the crucial clauses. That is why schedule 7 is particularly important, but it is somewhat vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that three times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You understand our problems, Mr. Hogg. As we try to concentrate on the subject, we are constantly interrupted by Conservative Members. We have had that problem all night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I trust that, in your wisdom, you will tell the hon. Gentleman that repetition is out of order. If Conservative Members are agitated by the tedious repetition, it is understandable that from time to time we should show it. It is not unusual in a Committee that has been sitting all night. The hon. Gentleman must realise that if he wishes to speak to the schedule, he must not constantly repeat himself yet tell us nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for that point of order. He is absolutely correct. But it is for the Chair to decide when tediousness has crept into the repetition. At the moment we are at the repetition stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Hogg. The repetition starts when Government supporters are repetitious in their behaviour. It is not for me to point it out. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for his usual patronising contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was dealing with schedule 7. Part of the problem is that the schedule is so vague. Paragraph 2 states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1066</span>
	<br><q><p>"The arrangements shall accord with such guidance as the Secretary of State may from time to time publish for the purpose of this Schedule."</p></q>
I know that those words are used in drafting—I have drafted a Bill myself. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Conservative Members laugh. But I drafted the Scotland Bill in 1987 and I have some knowledge of the sorts of words used. One should use the schedules to lay out in more detail some of the variable factors. I understand that one cannot account for everything, but I am surprised at the vagueness of paragraph 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 is specific. I think that I know the reason, but I hope that the Minister will explain why we go from a vague paragraph 2 to a specific paragraph 3, which states:
	<br><q><p>"The ballot shall be a secret postal ballot of, and only of, all parents".</p></q>
What is the necessity for the words "only of? I presume that it is necessary for a legal definition. I should be grateful if the Minister addressed that point. Paragraph 3 continues:
	<br><q><p>"all parents of children for the time being in attendance at the school".</p></q>
Are those words there for a specific reason? Will the Minister answer before I make my decision on how to vote on the schedule?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 gives more detail, although my hon. Friends have highlighted some of the problems that come even from that detail. But the paragraph states:
	<br><q><p>"given such information concerning the ballot as may be prescribed".</p></q>
That is incredibly vague. I am surprised that it could not be extended. It is written so tightly, particularly for a schedule. That has worried us all through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; All through the night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and all through the morning. That is why we want to look into those apparently innocuous, straightforward, often technical parts of the Bill. The more one looks at them, the more one finds in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was remiss of the Opposition not to welcome you back, Mr. Hogg. You will be pleased to have missed the all-night sitting, because it was an uncivilised time to discuss a subject of such importance to Scottish parents and pupils. For the record, I have not spoken since 5.35 am, so I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Hogg, if I spend a few minutes in highlighting some of our fears on the schedule without being tedious or repetitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have targeted some of those concerns. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) struck on paragraph 3, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). The paragraph contains some strange wording, but Opposition Members, being inexperienced, may have been misled by legal drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another query concerns the phrase
	<br><q><p>"and any question of whether a person is such a parent shall be determined by the board."</p></q>
There is a great debate in Scotland now on school boards and some schools are sending letters to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1067</span>
parents; I have received two letters about my own children. Schools are going through the process of identifying potential parents, writing to them, getting confirmation and building up the procedure. I imagine that further guidance will be given to an opted-out school when it changes its characteristics. The wording of paragraph 3 needs to be tidied, and I hope that I shall be assured when the Minister says, as per normal, that substantial documentation will be supplied in the form of regulation, guidance and information notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad feature of the schedule is that we have tried to improve it by tabling amendments. I do not want to go over ground that my hon. Friends have trodden, but schedule 7(4), subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) attempts to highlight the need for including information for the ballot along the lines of our previous amendment. We wanted more information related to the views of teaching and non-teaching staff to be included. My hon. Friends suggested that now might be an opportune time for the Minister to give a more measured response, as most of the far Right have disappeared from the scene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A press conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; My hon. Friend interrupts to say that they have gone to a press conference. I believe that the new Right is launching another pamphlet on the future of education, but we are not sure where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before my hon. Friend intervened, I was saying that the two amendments that we tried to insert would have made the process of consultation more democratic and would have given more prominence to the views of teaching and non-teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to escape a mass rush from the Committee Room. If such a provision had been built into the schedule, there would not have been such a long debate on the schedule this morning. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is like Sauchiehall street here with all the to-ing and fro-ing in the Committee. I am sure there is a reason, but I, like you Mr. Hogg, am slightly dismayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of our amendments dealt with the timeous release of information to people before they participated in a ballot to secure the change in characteristics. It may seem that we have taken a long time to debate the schedule, but it is crucial because it deals with characteristics that could be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I intend to suspend the Committee now until five minutes past midday. I should explain that I made an appointment this morning at the request of a senior Officer of the House. It was only after that that I learnt that I should be chairing this Committee. The Officer concerned is sufficiently senior that I do not wish to break the engagement. I hope that the Committee will accept my explanation for such a long suspension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On my way back to the Committee Room I was suitably impressed by a little pamphlet that I was given. I do not reflect on its contents, but it is an exceedingly smart document produced by the No Turning Back group of Conservative Members. I am assured that if it is read sufficiently well, we may agree with some of the comments in it. But that would be the subject for another debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like us to autograph his copy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will not respond to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I shall overcome that invitation properly at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about schedule 7. I had dealt with paragraph 3 and had started on paragraph 4, saying how big an improvement it would have been if the amendments previously debated had been accepted. The two issues mentioned were the contributions of teaching and non-teaching staff to information given to parents and that the implications of securing a change in characteristics should best be given to parents at least 21 days before the ballot. We hope that the Minister's comments will further reflect upon those issues. They reinforce our overall worries about schedule 7, a small schedule of five paragraphs dealing with the major issue of the characteristics of self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on clause 28 was long. As my hon. Friends have suggested, schedule 7 has thrown up several difficulties. But I am sure that they could be ironed out with further assurances from the Minister. I hope that we have not been overharsh about the drafting. The inexperience of Opposition Members often lends weight to the view that the drafting techniques of more experienced hon. Members have still to filter through to Her Majesty's Official Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) touched on amendment No. 186 to paragraph 5. Much has been made of the removal of the words
	<br><q><p>"and to the consent of the Secretary of State being obtained".</p></q>
The Minister has argued that many Government amendments are tabled in response to issues raised in Committee. That is valid, but many are tidying up an untidy Bill. Amendment No. 186 may or may not be an improvement, but schedule 7 is designed to ensure a speedy, efficient and satisfactory ballot of parents in the event of self-governing schools wishing to change the characteristics that have been discussed in clause 28, identified in clause 16(4) and which stem from clause 2 and the scheme of administration detailed for self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had to deal with a complex issue in a fairly piecemeal way in only four or five weeks. That is not long for an outstandingly important Bill on the future of education in Scotland and what we fear for it in the hands of the present administration at the Scottish Office.

It would be useful for me to end my comments now. I am well aware of the skill with which you, Mr. Hogg, bring discipline and order to the Committee. Even in the deepest and darkest hours before dawn, we were engaged in honourable combat with Her Majesty's Government. We tried to live up to the undeniable qualities that you would seek from any Committee of which you were Chairman. That is no idle boast. Before I stretch your tolerance much more, Mr. Hogg, I hope that the Minister will respond positively to a lengthy resume of what some would regard as a reasonably insignificant schedule. We believe it to be most important, which I am sure the Minister will reflect in his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help observing that 24 hours after we were supposed to start discussion of clause 28 and schedule 7, we find ourselves dealing with matters which, had the Opposition kept their word, we should have disposed of yesterday. I am not sure what has been achieved, except that the debate on the change in the character of schools took place in the early hours of the morning, when sensible people were in their beds. No doubt the Opposition will be able to explain their actions to the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to a number of points raised about schedule 7. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) got himself into a bit of a muddle, aided and abetted by the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), who I suspect knows better but may be in a genuine muddle. I assumed that the hon. Member for Dundee, East was saying that the Government had stated that the Secretary of State could change the characteristics of a self-governing school simply by exercising his power to vary a scheme of government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way? I can clarify what he assumed I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will listen to what I assume he said, perhaps he will be able to clarify what I said that he said. He said that the Secretary of State could change the characteristics of a self-governing school simply by exercising his power to vary a scheme of government under clause 2(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to distinguish between what the Minister said and what I said. I did not suggest that the Secretary of State for Scotland had the power under clause 2(2) to change the characteristics. I said that the Minister had said it during an exchange with Opposition Members. The mistake was the Minister's, not the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distinction between what Ministers say and what the Government say does not exist on the Conservative Benches. We know that there are distinctions on the Opposition Front Bench, which we saw when the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) distanced himself from the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) and his remarks describing religion as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1070</span>
witchcraft. But the Government and the Minister are the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East said that I had stated that the Secretary of State could change the characteristics of self-governing schools simply by exercising his power to vary the scheme of government under clause 2(2). The hon. Gentleman took that statement out of context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to what would happen in the unhappy event of the acceptance of Opposition amendments in the group No. 156, 157 and so on to clause 28, to which one or two of my hon. Friends were attracted. I said that the effect of any one of those proposed amendments would be that a specific aspect of a school under clause 16(4) would no longer be a characteristic of a school within the definition laid down in clause 28(12). That would mean that the procedure required under clause 28 for a change in a school's characteristics would not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am replying to a question that I was asked in the debate. Such an aspect would then be like any other aspect of the school specified in the school scheme of government, which could be varied by order of the Secretary of State under clause 2(2). In practice, the board of management would refer the matter to the Secretary of State for a change in the scheme of government. I hope that that makes the position clear to hon. Members, and that any confusion that they might have had in their minds no longer exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked how single-sex schools could be established. A specific derogation on single-sex schools is contained in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. It applies to self-governing schools under paragraph 5 of schedule 10. The hon. Gentleman then referred to the Secretary of State's power to change a school's characteristics. He would only have had such a power if the technically incompetent Opposition amendments to clause 28 had been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked me what would happen if there were a failure to provide a ballot paper. The remedy would be to complain to the Secretary of State who can deal with the board under section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 which covers breach of statutory duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East also asked about religious discrimination and about the withdrawal of pupils from religious instruction. A pupil is protected under section 9—known as the "conscience clause"—of the 1980 Act. Such a pupil must not be placed at a disadvantage in respect of secular instruction at school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discrimination on ethnic grounds is contrary to the Race Relations Act 1976. That provision is covered by schedule 10 to the Bill. The matter of how a question on the change of a school's characteristics is framed on the ballot paper will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1071</span>
set out in general terms in the proposed guidance. Inevitably, it will vary from one case to another. The details will be a matter for the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East referred to provisions contained in schedule 7 and paragraph 5 to schedule 7. We have discussed the information that will be provided to school staff about a proposed change in the school's characteristics. I understand that it is being put about by Opposition Members that my hon. Friends rebelled against my advice on that matter. I was, and am, perfectly happy with the wording of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Western Isles said, the schedules already provide the Secretary of State with the necessary powers. The amendments tabled by the Opposition were technically incompetent. In an effort to speed up our proceedings at a time when they were being delayed for reasons that are now explicable, but were inexplicable then, I was inclined to help the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "rebellion" applies to circumstances in which members of a political party vote against a measure that is proposed by their party. I rebelled against the Opposition's proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Both he and I voted against the Opposition amendments because they were technically incorrect. Their withdrawal came some considerable time after I made my offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a shambles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The conduct of Opposition Members is a shambles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we may be straining the patience of the Chair. I had better move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been more than patient during our proceedings and has made every effort to accommodate the Opposition. Conservative Back Benchers are becoming increasingly fed up with the tactics of Opposition Members. I warn that I shall seek to catch Mr. Speaker's eye tomorrow afternoon. If the Bill is not timetabled, I shall ask Mr. Speaker to ensure that it is. We want a proper and decent debate and do not want to be subject to the farce that we have seen over the past 24 hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman can intervene in the debate provided that his remarks are relevant to schedule 7. What he does on the Floor of the House is entirely his business, but those of us serving on the Committee wish to consider schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 7 is the last controversial section of the Bill covered by part I. The Committee has done extremely well to proceed this far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I wish to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is clear that the Minister is not giving way to the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). What the Minister does is a matter entirely for him to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East expressed anxiety about the provisions in paragraph 5 to schedule 7 and schedule 3. They deal with information provided to school staff about a proposed change of a school's characteristics. I was willing to undertake to consider the matter when we debated amendments Nos. 140, 141 and 195, but as the hon. Member for Western Isles cleverly ascertained, the schedule provides for such arrangements. Even though the Opposition will not have the opportunity to discuss the amendments further, all is well that ends well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that he has just dealt a final, crushing blow to the morale of his Back Benchers? Not only were they driven to rebel against his wishes, but he has just told them that the rebellion was for naught as the provision was in the Bill anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have dealt with the rebellion. I know that the hon. Gentleman needs a straw at which to clutch to explain the conduct of Opposition Members. But my hon. Friend's reaction, the 	<i>Official Report</i> and the events of last night will speak for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked about the absence of a provision for copies of lists of parents in paragraph 3 of schedule 7, and compared that measure with paragraph 3 of schedule 3. As so many of the hon. Gentleman's views are wrong, it is necessary for me to confirm those that are right. He was correct when he said that when a school is self governing, the board of management will have the necessary information available. Before it becomes self governing, the board must be provided with that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is straightforward and simple, and provides arrangements for the ballot. I am surprised that it has taken up so much of the committee's time, but on reading the newspapers this morning, we all now know why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DISCONTINUANCE BY BOARD OF MANAGEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 19, line 17, after "days", insert
	<br><q><p>",nor more than forty-two days,".</p></q>
This is an interesting amendment which places a maximum time limit on the board of management in respect of the making of a second resolution for the discontinuance of a self-governing school. As now drafted, when a board of management wishes to discontinue a self-governing school, it must pass a second resolution to that effect not less than 28 days after the first. There is, however, no provision for a maximum time within which a second resolution must be passed. That could give rise to considerable uncertainty over an indefinite period if, for instance, a board of management had passed a resolution but then began to have second thoughts. The amendment corrects that by providing that a second resolution must be passed not more than 42 days after the first. If no such second resolution were passed within 42 days, the prospect of discontinuance would clearly no longer be on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for speaking so succinctly to the amendment. I shall try to reciprocate so that we can gallop along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that this is an interesting amendment. It is probably quite an important one, too, with which we would generally agree. We do not want uncertainty in the matter. A board of management that is considering the discontinuation of the school must have one resolution and then another within a certain period of time. We would not want the matter to drag on for months. The Minister is right to table an amendment that will help eliminate uncertainty. I am not convinced that his timescale is right, but we shall not push that matter as the principle is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have a reasonable time of about two months because obligations under subsection (4)(b)(i) referring to section 22 A of the 1980 Act must be considered before the second resolution. That section of the Act refers to consultations and changes in educational matters and provides that when an education authority makes a proposal about a prescribed time, it must publish or otherwise make it available and consult such persons as may be prescribed. "Prescribed" means prescribed by the Secretary of State or regulations. Subsection (2) refers to the Secretary of State including proposals to discontinue any school under the management of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to discuss that at length. The Minister's amendment will allow time for consideration and, when we discuss clause stand part, we shall be able to go into that matter in greater detail. There must be time between the first and second resolutions so that information required
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1074</span>
under the 1980 Act, referred to in subsection (4)(b)(i), may be considered. Perhaps the Minister has got the time about right in his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), I must admit that I agree that the periods of time referred to seem reasonable. Let us suppose that the resolution fell the second time around. Would that mean that the school could never again raise that issue? The school may wish to renew the issue at a later date, so how will it get round that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interpretation would be that it would not preclude a school from proposing that a second time, even if it failed because of the time limitations. I am sure that the Minister will say whether or not I am right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was this eminently sensible amendment not included in the Bill in the first place? It has nothing to do with sloppy drafting which needs technical amendments. It is surprising that such an important issue of principle should have been missed out. It is not a minor drafting or technical amendment but an important principle. A time limit will apply between the first and second resolutions to remove uncertainty. There will be great uncertainty when a school is being considered for discontinuation among the parents and the pupils, and we shall discuss the problems in later clauses about what will happen following discontinuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister responds, will he say why such an important matter was not included in the Bill in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) has left the Committee. It is sad to see the number of people who associate themselves with the No Turning Back group, but who have turned their backs on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I caution my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who said that it was an eminently sensible amendment. We should examine it more closely and seek more information from the Minister before we agree that it is sensible and should be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One advantage of having been without sleep for more than 27 hours is that one no longer has to pretend to be clever. There is a good excuse for making stupid contributions and daft suggestions. So may I ask for the tolerance of the Committee if I try to understand the Minister's position by explaining it briefly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the clause says that a first resolution has to be passed by the board of management and then, not sooner than 28 days later, a second resolution has to be passed. I understand why time has to pass between the first and the second resolutions. Many boards of management will be small bodies. For schools with fewer than 500 pupils, the board will consist of four parent members, one staff member, three appointed members and one head teacher—nine people in all. The first resolution could have been passed on a five to four majority. That narrow majority would not be too difficult to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1075</span>
obtain given that the four parent members with a parental majority on the school board that first set up the board of management will be able to appoint the co-opted members to the board of management, so the co-opted members will probably be of like mind and closely associated with the parent members. It should not be too difficult for five of them to get together and pass the first resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the resolution has been passed by the board of management, I assume that it will become public knowledge among the parents and will excite general interest. The question is whether 28 days is sufficient for parents to organise a campaign to convince the board of management to change its mind and not pass the second resolution. The Minister appears to have recognised that 28 days is not enough. Why does he think that 14 more days would be enough for a comprehensive approach so that no stone was left unturned before the second resolution was considered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the publication of the first resolution, an almighty public quarrel could ensue between the parents and the school. There could be massive pressure on both sides of the divide on the board of management—on the side with five votes and on the side with four votes. Only one member would have to switch sides for the second resolution to be unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister does not now think that four weeks is enough for such a process, but he thinks that six weeks is enough. I do not know how long we have been in Committee, but no one seems yet to have convinced anyone else to change his or her mind on the Bill. Over four or five weeks we have had far more time to debate the matter than parents would have between the first and the second resolutions. Is the Minister confident that he has allowed enough time for everyone to contribute and for extra information to be collected and presented to the board, for campaigning, public meetings, and so on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when the Tories closed schools under education authority control in Tayside. That was a much longer process. It took far more than six weeks to get the decision to close the schools through the regional council. The whole affair took more than a year. I remember that the local school of a Tory regional councillor was due to close down, and that lady was conveniently taken ill and left the chamber five minutes before the vote was taken so that she did not have to support her administration in closing a school in her back yard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much time and effort was devoted to making sure that the decisions were correct then. Will the Minister explain why he considers six weeks enough time for the parents of a self-governing school to make a real case and a real campaign to try to change the board of management's mind? I am not convinced that 42 days is enough, and I should be interested to find out what advice the Minister received from his civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the time limit based on a comparison with time limits in any sector of education anywhere in Europe? Can similar proposals be found anywhere else, or are the Government's proposals unique? Did the Minister simply pull the 28-day period out of the air
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1076</span>
and write it into the Bill, then have second thoughts and decide to give another two weeks, for no scientific reason? What were the thought processes of the Minister and his advisers, and what do other Conservative Members think about the time limit? Much greater care should be taken over the important decision to close a school than six weeks will allow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unusually, the hon. Member for Dundee, East has befuddled his brain and is mistaken. Perhaps lack of sleep is affecting us all. The 28 days is the period that must elapse before the second resolution is made; the 42 days is a maximum period for the delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not worse. When such a serious decision is taken a period of not less than 28 days and not more than 42 days must elapse before it is confirmed. That will help to avoid uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may labour under the misapprehension that that period is all that is allowed for the whole procedure. The clause lays out that procedure, the first part of which is that the board of management must pass a resolution to discontinue the school and must confirm that resolution at a later meeting. It then has to notify the education authority and the Secretary of State. Within six months it must publish proposals for discontinuing the school. The proposals must say whether the education authority has published proposals of its own. Two months must then elapse, within which any person may make representations to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State then decides whether to accept the proposals. That is a quite a drawn-out process. The hon. Member for Dundee, East may have thought that the whole process had to take place within 42 days. The decision to proceed with discontinuance is serious and should be confirmed. There is a 28-day period for reflection, but reflection should not take so long that it creates uncertainty about the school's future. The hon. Gentleman can feel reasonably confident about the provision, given that background. I agree that the details are slightly confusing and I, too, had to think hard about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for putting right my misinterpretation of the amendment. I thought that it stipulated a six-week delay before the original resolution was confirmed, but the Minister has straightened me out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will still be possible for the board of management to confirm the first resolution within four weeks. But the Minister was mistaken to say that I believed that that would be the end of the process. I realise how many stages there are, but we should draw a distinction between this stage and later stages of the process. At this stage, parents are dealing with a board of management that they have elected directly and over which they have some influence. The board of management is directly accountable to parents, and the first stage is that at which parents will be able to exercise most influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1077</span>
Once the proposals are published, they will be sent to the Secretary of State for consultations. It is certain that parents have no influence over the present Secretary of State for Scotland, who does not relate to the people of Scotland at all. He is not accountable to people in Scotland. He is Secretary of State for Scotland despite the people of Scotland and the way in which they voted. They cannot hope to influence a decision that the Secretary of State may make later in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity for parents to make an influential intervention and to stop the process arises with the board of management instead of later with the Secretary of State for Scotland. That is an important distinction which the Minister must consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman completely ignores the two-month period that is set aside and during which anyone, including parents, may make representations to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is so used to the idea that he and the Secretary of State may do much as they wish in Scotland that he does not appreciate the relationship between those who are elected to office and those who elect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, because parents may make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland, that will make all the difference, but of course it will not make a difference. The Secretary of State for Scotland may ignore what the parents say. They will have no control or power over him. His position depends not on parents who are affected by a proposal to close a school, but on those in Edinburgh, Pentlands who elect him. Those are the only people in Scotland to whom he is accountable. Very few other people in Scotland voted for him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pretty few people voted for the hon. Gentleman, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps few voted for me, but many more voted for my hon. Friends. My party represents the Scottish people and is accountable to them for the way in which we conduct ourselves. One of the tragedies is that the Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland are not accountable to the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister fails to understand the difference between the two stages. At the initial stage, those who make the second decision about confirming the resolution of people who are directly accountable to parents are more likely to listen to representations from parents than is the Secretary of State for Scotland at the second stage. That distinction is important. The Minister is so used to getting away with undemocratic behaviour that he probably does not understand the significance of that, but Opposition Members understand the significance of it, and it is important that as much time as possible is given at the first stage to allow parents to make representations to those whom they directly elect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1078</span>
That is better than allowing them a longer period later to make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who may ignore what they have to say and need not worry about what they think or how they may vote in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people on the board of management will worry about what parents think—as the Minister said, they will be accountable to parents. We should strengthen that accountability and give parents more time in which to try to exercise their influence and to bring the board of management into line with what parents want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the purpose of the clause and the amendment is to make it easier for the Secretary of State for Scotland to close schools. Anyone who has had any connection with school closures knows how difficult it is to close a school unless there is agreement that it has declined so much that it should be closed. When I was a Tayside regional councillor, three schools in Dundee were closed and it took between 18 months and two years to effect those closures because of the democratic process. The democratic process provided under the clause is not as sure and secure as the existing education authority system. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have tried desperately to understand how the amendment is relevant to school closures. Nothing in the clause covers school closures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. On this occasion I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. The speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was relevant to the clause and the amendment. That is why I allowed it. I assure the hon. Member for Tayside, North that if any member of the committee strays out of order, I shall bring him back to order quickly. That has been my practice throughout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a magisterial comment, Mr. Hogg, and put the hon. Member for Tayside, North firmly in his place. He went to sleep about 12 hours ago and has not woken up, but he periodically makes ridiculous suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers school closures. That is why I am trying to make Conservative Members wake up and understand what is happening. The parents' only chance of effectively intervening in the school closure process is at the initial stage when the board of management is dealing with the first and second resolutions. Thereafter, the process passes out of the control of parents. If the Minister cannot tell us why he has picked a period of four to six weeks, will he take the provision back, consult with his officials and more widely, and look at the position under the education authorities in Scotland, England and Wales? Will he strengthen the relationship that allows parents to intervene effectively in decisions to close their schools and deny their children the right to attend the schools of their choice? I thought that was what the Bill was about, because that is what Conservative Members have been telling us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East has made reasonable and pertinent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1079</span>
points. I was tempted to disagree with him somewhat on his earlier interpretation of the amendment, but now that the interpretation has been corrected by the Minister we see that the measure is a great deal more draconian than we suspected. Therefore, I feel bound to join my hon. Friend in pressing his case. What he has been unable to do with the force of his eloquence, the weight of numbers of voices may achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause that my hon. Friend advances should appeal to Conservative Members. We often hear interventions from the hon. Member for Eastwood about school closures in his neighbourhood. I am not familiar with the details of the cases that he refers to, so I shall not attempt to deal with them. However, if a local authority passed a resolution that it intended to close a particular school, and gave four weeks only for consultation, the hon. Member for Eastwood would be the first to be up in arms in protest. He would ask how the local authority could expect the parents in his community to make representations within such a truncated period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should recognise that the four-week period is not what is allowed for consultation. We are debating the period between a decision to discontinue a school and embarking on the procedure, and the confirmation of that decision. The board of management would be taking a serious step and a confirmation decision is required. That has nothing to do with the period of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mcdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the Minister can say that. Four weeks is the shortest period in which the board of management can pass a second resolution; thereafter the matter goes to the Secretary of State. It is therefore possible for the board of management to conclude its part of the process within a four-week period. In subsection (5) there is a provision for any member of the public to submit representations to the Secretary of State after the proposal has been submitted to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are interested in the influence of those people most directly affected, via the body supposed to represent the parents' interests, the board of management. Is the Minister implying that the representations on the proposals that any member of the public can make to the Secretary of State are an adequate substitute for the input that can be achieved democratically through a board of management? That would indeed be strange.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing two things. After a second decision has been taken, the board has six months in which to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1080</span>
draw up proposals. When drawing up proposals, representations from parents and others will be taken into account. Because the hon. Gentleman is dealing—rightly—with the amendment, he is not dealing with the provisions in clause 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we understand the implications. When he says that the board of management will publish the proposals, the Minister is misleading the Committee. The Bill says that the board of management
	<br><q><p>"may within the period of six months … publish proposals".</p></q>
The board is not obliged to publish proposals for closure; it is entirely a matter of permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point and a perplexing one. The same subsection says that the board of management
	<br><q><p>"shall submit to him"—</p></q>
the Secretary of State—
	<br><q><p>"a copy of the published proposals."</p></q>
If publication of the proposals is only an option, how does "may" become "shall" within the scope of one subsection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a drafting mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be a drafting mistake, or there may be substance to it. In any case, there are grounds for concern that there is inadequate opportunity for parents' direct input into the process. The proposals that are to be published already commit the board of management to the course of closure—it is no longer an option. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
