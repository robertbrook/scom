	<time>Thursday 27 April 1989</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. When the Committee adjourned yesterday—if yesterday is the correct parliamentary description; perhaps it was the day before yesterday—your last words were that the Committee had clocked up 99½ hours, and that we might achieve a ton today. Have you received any information through the usual channels about a report that the Government have offered the Opposition another 60 or 80 hours of debate, but that the Opposition want a guillotine imposed? The Government are prepared to go on talking, whereas the Opposition are interested only in making futile political gestures. My hon Friends and I are prepared to continue to debate the issues for many more weeks in the same sane, careful and forthright manner, that we have adopted in previous sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had anything to do with usual channels for two and a half years and I intend to improve that record. I have not had any discussions with Her Majesty's Opposition. The tactics deployed by either side of the Committee are nothing to do with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Will you ask my hon. Friend the Minister to make a statement about a newspaper report, which I read in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> today? It states that a guillotine had been suggested. Conservative Members believe that they have an important duty to take part in the debate on all clauses. We are, therefore, amazed by the suggestion of a guillotine, especially as the report states further that my hon. Friend the Minister has offered the Opposition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"60 more hours of debate".</p></blockquote>
but that the offer was turned down. If the guillotine were introduced because of the Opposition's failure to agree such a reasonable timetable, it would be a travesty. Will my hon. Friend the Minister state the Government's position on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amount of time offered by a Minister or any other party forms no part of the Committee's proceedings. The Committee must consider the Bill and we should now move on to the stand part debate on clause 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hogg. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1084</span>
Committee must establish the accuracy of the reports as they do not make it clear who wants the guillotine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The question has been well aired. I shall not take further points of order about a guillotine, whether it exists or not. I shall proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a genuine point of order, Mr. Hogg. I draw your attention to a statement made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), which is a serious matter. In a press release, he referred to some Conservative Members of the Committee as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a very unpleasant collection of Right-wing, hard line extremists"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"some of the most offensive members of the Tory party".</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members can take criticism, but we object to an hon. Member who has taken no part in the Committee's proceedings making comments about hon. Members who have. That is out of order and offensive. The hon. Gentleman should not have fielded his second XI when he could have been on the Committee himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is entirely in order in making those comments. The hon. Gentleman should not be too sensitive about them. I hope that he will come to recognise that such knockabout is commonplace in politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a new point of order, Mr. Hogg. Who is the shadowy Macbeth figure clanking his chains in the Corridor? Why is he not a member of the Committee, as he presumably could have been. We have sat for nearly 100 hours. Perhaps the hon. Member for Garscadden is embarrassed about leaving the responsibility of leading for the Opposition in the hands of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) who, though a pleasant, likeable and hardworking chap, has ballsed it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall not allow that so-called new point of order to go any further. It is almost as bad as the hon. Member's knowledge of Shakespeare. He should recall that Banquo, not Macbeth, was the ghost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a different and genuine point of order, Mr. Hogg. I appreciate what is and is not your responsibility, but it is normal for the Opposition to inform the Chairman of their likely progress. Am I correct in supposing that the Opposition have given no hint that they wish to make any real progress in this morning's Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. From time to time, the Opposition and the Government advise me and my co-Chairman—through the Whips and Front-Bench spokesmen—of their intentions regarding the Bill's progress. I assure the hon. Gentleman that gloomy forecasts are in order for today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I should like to draw your attention
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1085</span>
to a statement made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion):
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the Government seek to cut the debate and prevent the arguments from being exposed by axing the Committee… I would not object then to trying to disrupt the Bill's progress."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 16 March 1989; c. 19.]</p></blockquote>
Will you ask the hon. Member, who is unfortunately not present, whether he intends to disrupt further proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should put that question more directly to the hon. Member who made the statement. I cannot ask him questions when he is not present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I must pursue the issue that I raised earlier. At 4.30 pm my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will make a business statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member does not know that. That is a matter for the Leader of the House. The hon. Member cannot be privy to that information—short of being a member of the Cabinet, to which rank he has not yet been called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Hogg, to point out that a business statement would not be announced until 1 o'clock, on the annunciator. However, we know that the Leader of the Opposition will ask my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, at 3.30 pm, to make a statement about next week's business. When the Leader of the House does so, he may make an announcement that will affect the proceedings of the Committee. The matter may arise during business questions, and we need to know before 4.30 pm whether it is possible to prevent the Leader of the House committing the Committee to a timetable motion. It would solve many problems, if my hon. Friend the Minister and the Opposition told us whether they have had any discussions about extra hours for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has pursued that point before and it has been answered. On his first point, nothing will happen to the Committee until the House agrees. Even if the Leader of the House were to announce the introduction of a guillotine motion for the Bill, it would not operate until the House had decided upon it. Neither of those things has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I hope that you and your co-Chairman will agree that the conduct of the Committee has been within the rules. Other than on the first sitting when the proceedings were disrupted by hon. Members who were not members of the Committee, the Chairman has not suggested that we have broken the rules. Will you, therefore, Mr. Hogg, say why I and my hon. Friends have been described as undignified and irresponsible when we have behaved properly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that anyone has described the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1086</span>
Walker) as undignified and irresponsible. I find it unthinkable that such things could be said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 29</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISCONTINUANCE BY BOARD OF MANAGEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to speak on the clause. Before I do so, I hope that you, Mr. Hogg, will allow me to digress for a minute so that the Committee can note the outstanding victory of the Scottish international football side last night. We beat Cyprus and that virtually ensures us of a place in the World Cup finals in Italy. I hope that the English team is able to limp along and eventually qualify to provide some decent competition. The English team has had trouble qualifying before, and its entry to the finals once depended on it hosting the tournament. Nevertheless, we wish it the same luck as Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have been gracious, Mr. Hogg, in allowing me to digress, so I shall immediately return to the clause, which is interesting and important. I dare say that some clauses are more important than others, but, as I have said before, innocuous and straightforward clauses normally contain some unanswered questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the position should an opted-out school wish to be discontinued. That is a built-in failure mechanism. The Bill's premise is that such schools will be the greatest thing since sliced bread and will revolutionise Scottish education. They will produce another Plato, Aristotle, Einstein, Wittgenstein—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: David Hume.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, David Hume, Adam Smith, James Watt, John Logie Baird, John McAdam and whoever one wishes to mention. Despite that, the Bill has a built-in failure provision. It accepts that opted-out schools will fail. I am surprised at that. No doubt, the Minister will reply that the clause is merely a legal requirement and that opted-out schools are unlikely to fail, but such rare circumstances have to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it in order for the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to sit on his knees at the back of the Committee talking to people who are not members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prefer members of the Committee to sit in their seat and to be attentive to the proceedings. I am sure that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting that it took about 15 minutes for us to start the debate this morning because of spurious, wrecking points of order. No

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1087</span>
sooner do I get started on my train of thought than there is another interruption. It has been almost impossible to make a contribution in this Committee—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> A Conservative Member is following the usual pattern of shouting from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. My hon. Friend was merely trying to suggest that if we have to endure the remarks of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), why should not the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. We should proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that you will have trouble keeping order this morning, Mr. Hogg, because of interruptions from Conservative Members. I shall not respond in kind because we are desperately keen to debate the issues as our time will probably be cut short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Fife, Central speaks to people outside the Committee more often than he speaks in the Committee, perhaps I can ask the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have had a fair run at scoring points this morning. What the hon. Member for Fife, Central does outside the Committee Room is not our concern. It would be better if the hon. Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) directed their remarks only to clause 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is speaking on behalf of the Opposition at the moment, I simply want to ask him whether they would be prepared to agree informally to a timetable of 60 more hours of debate on this and subsequent clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must not ask such questions. Whether there is to be a further 60 hours of debate on the Bill as a whole does not form part of "Discontinuance by board of management", which is the rubric of clause 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Hogg, I would not stray from the strait and narrow, Being Presbyterians, you and I follow that code of behaviour. Perhaps being Presbyterian will save me from the abuse of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who smeared the Catholic faith in the previous sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds suspiciously as if the hon. Member is straying off the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hogg. As the Bible says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."</p></blockquote>
Even I do so from time to time. However, it also says:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1088</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth".</p></blockquote>
Clause 29 contains no biblical quotations. It deals with what will happen after the discontinuance of an opted-out school. Such schools are supposed to be the great panacea for Scottish education problems, so it is surprising that the Bill has a built-in mechanism for their failure. For that reason, we should examine it closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already debated Government amendment No. 188, which I welcomed although my hon. Friends were not so keen on the six-week provision. The time between the first and second resolutions, as described in subsections (2)(a) and (b), is the mechanism to be used for discontinuing a school but, as the Minister said at the end of our previous sitting, that is not the only mechanism. He said that it was the trigger for starting the process and that there would be other hurdles if the board wished to discontinue the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsction (2)(a) presents Opposition Members with a slight conflict. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) pointed out that it was wrong to neglect the rights of parents of children in a school that decided to discontinue as an opted-out school; they should still have proper rights of consultation. There should not be a punishment-type philosophy that if people do not do all that we want or follow us along one line they should be punished and the natural laws of justice suspended. That is not our view. My hon. Friends the Members for Dundee, East and for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) were right to point out that those parents should be considered, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps four to six weeks between resolutions will not be long enough, but the counter argument in subsection (a) shows that there will be some uncertainty once the school board has moved the first resolution. The Minister was right to point out that that uncertainty must be removed as quickly as possible to trigger the mechanism over the other hurdles. Before the process can be taken further, consultation must take place. As the Opposition are not happy about self-governing schools, perhaps the sooner the mechanism is triggered into action and the opted-out school abolished, the better. But we cannot forget the rights of parents of children in such a school. That is why we debated the Government amendment to subsection (2)(a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the first and second resolutions have been passed, the rest of the hurdles follow. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The notice required by subsection (2)(b) shall be given as soon as practicable after the passing of the resolution".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The published proposals—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) shall specify the proposed date of discontinuance of the school; and"—</p></blockquote>
this is what I want to discuss—
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) shall be accompanied by a statement—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) indicating whether or not any proposals with respect to the establishment of a new school on the premises of the school have been published under section 22A of the 1980 Act (provision for consultation on certain changes)".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will explain exactly what that means. I do not necessarily disagree with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1089</span>
provision; the Minister should not always think that my questions are hostile and so respond in a hostile manner. Sometimes Opposition Members raise points on which we want information or an explanation before we decide whether we wish to accept a provision, and sometimes the Bill merely needs to be tidied up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 22 A of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>"Consultation on, and consent for—changes in certain educational matters"</i></p></blockquote>
It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Where an education authority make a proposal of a prescribed kind, they shall, in such manner as may be prescribed, publish it or otherwise make it available and consult such persons as may be prescribed and shall not reach a decision on it without having regard to any representations made to them on it by those persons."</p></blockquote>
That is straightforward. The important phrase is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"make a proposal of a prescribed kind".</p></blockquote>
Subsection 2 then states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section 'prescribed' means prescribed for the purposes of this section by the Secretary of State by regulations and in so prescribing kinds of proposals the Secretary of State shall include proposals to discontinue or change the site of any school under the management of an education authority."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (4)(b)(i) talks about proposals with respect to the establishment of a new school. Does that mean that an education authority school will be moved on to the premises? What is the purpose of the provision? Are the provisions in subsection (4)(b)(i) simply the same as those in the 1980 Act in respect of an opted-out school closing or being "discontinued":
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 22A(2) of the 1980 Act talks about proposals to discontinue or change the site of any school under the management of an education authority. Could a nearby education authority school that was in a bad building move into a discontinued opted-out school's premises? Is that the nature of the proposals? If a school is discontinued, will there be consultation with the education authority? Will the school be discontinued because it is a failure, or because the education authority and the opted-out school are discussing the reorganisation of education in the area, and as a result one school is being moved across to other premises?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probably the answer lies in the use of the word "discontinuance" rather than closure. Discontinuance does not necessarily imply closure. It could mean that the school continued in another form on another site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On another site. Is the Minister saying that if an opted-out school changes its site, it has to go through the procedures set out in clause 29?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister said that discontinuation could just mean changing to another site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For example, a self-governing school that wished to cease to be self-governing could be taken over by the local authority. The school could continue as a local authority school on the same site, or it could continue in other premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the regulations in respect of the 1980 Act. If a school is proposed for closure or for a change of site by the local authority, the regulations require consultation and, in some case, the consent of the Secretary of State. With reference to the regulations on Paisley grammar that we discussed last year, the 80 per cent, rule applies to a change of site as well as to a proposal for closure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I am glad that he realises that this is not a hostile question. I am beginning to understand. The provisions in subsection 4(b)(i) will apply because the school will discontinue. If a self-governing school closed and re- emerged as an education authority school, it would have to go through the procedure set out in the clause. But if it changed its site, would it have to through that procedure? The Minister has said no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For legal considerations, the board of management is the school. If a self-governing school ceases to be self-governing, the board of management will disappear, but the school—the building, functions and pupils—could continue under local authority management.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is dealt with later in the Bill. I hope that you will not object, Mr. Hogg, if I digress and refer to the layout of the Bill. My hon. Friend's point is dealt with from clause 44 onwards. I appreciate the train of thought that led from changing a school's characteristics to discontinuance, but it might have been more appropriate to locate this measure later in the Bill, perhaps as clause 43. The disposal of assets, and other such matters, are well laid out in clause 44 and later. We shall discuss that when we debate the relevant clauses.

Yesterday he decided to filibuster in a piffling little statutory instrument Committee, of which he was not a member, instead of taking his place here and leading for the Opposition. The press release shows clearly that the Labour party leadership recognises that there has been a complete mess-up on the Opposition Benches. Far from being poisonous, the Committee has been rather good-natured, although both sides have been firm in their views. Does the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the self-governing school will have to follow the same procedures as an education authority, as contained with section 22A(2) of the 1980 Act. I wondered whether the measure referred to the possibility of the education authority using the school for another purpose. In other words, did the education authority have to go through the procedure of subsection (4)(b)(i) if it wished to move another school into that school? Even if that school is to be discontinued or sold off by whatever means, it appears that the authority has to go through that procedure. In answer to the hon. Member for Ipswich
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1092</span>
(Mr. Irvine), the purpose of a Committee is to iron out those details and make clear what is involved. If Conservative Members spent some time dealing with the Bill rather than doing their mail and making cheap political points, they would enhance the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(b)(ii) deals with a statement
	<br><blockquote><p>"explaining the effect of subsection (5) below."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before the end of the period of two months beginning with the date of publication of the proposals, any person may submit representations to the Secretary of State in respect of the proposed discontinuance."</p></blockquote>
How does one explain the effect of making representations to the Secretary of State? If one makes representations to the Secretary of State at present, he will ignore them. Do the published proposals contain a provision that any representations made to the Secretary of State under subsection (5) will be ignored, or that they will revolutionise the nature of education and halt the proposals? I do not understand the phrase "explaining the effect". Is it the effect of the proposed closure, or is it just the effect of making representations to the Secretary of State, which is what I understand it to mean? I can see that Conservative Members' minds are working. I am sure that that cannot be what it is meant to mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's points, and will respond at the appropriate time. This is not a discursive, question-and-answer session that enables the hon. Gentleman to sort out the meaning of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) is right to point out to the hon. Gentleman that: it is his job to understand and improve the meaning of the Bill, or to point to deficiencies, not to use the Committee as a kind of tutorial for the hon. Gentleman to get himself up to speed on the Bill's contents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to improve the Bill. This clause makes no sense. I have given the Minister a chance to respond and say whether it makes sense, at the end or as we are proceeding. I understand perfectly well what the Bill means, but am being generous and asking him to consider whether it is worded wrongly. I could make my point in the Minister's brutal, up-front, abrasive, poisonous style if I so chose. But I do not choose to use that style.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might be helpful if the hon. Member withdrew the word "poisonous". That is a little to strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall withdraw it, Mr. Hogg, and I shall not substitute it with any other words that might be suggested. I hope that the Minister will explain the meaning of subsection (4)(b)(ii). A Bill can sometimes be ambiguous, as we know only too well, so it is correct and proper that we should examine each clause. In the past both sides of Committees have thought that Bills should be interpreted in one way but subsequently Ministers,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1093</span>
including the Under-Secretary, interpreted them in another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making important points. If the Minister wishes me to change my style and not be decent and fair towards him, I am prepared to use an abrasive style. The clause is apparently innocuous and deals with the discontinuance of schools. But it is not only theoretically possible that schools will wish to be discontinued, it is a practical reality. We would have included such a provision, but I am surprised that the Minister has included it and I shall give him plenty of opportunity to respond to my points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pose questions on the clause with some trepidation because I get the feeling that the Minister will snap at my heels and say that I should have spotted the answers somewhere else in the Bill. I assume that he is not in a good mood considering the pasting that Conservative Members received from the Opposition the other night. I shall have to brave his wrath and ask my questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(a) deals with the circumstances in which two resolutions have to be passed to discontinue a school. That seems a reasonable approach. We must consider the possibility of the board changing its mind and allow for a distance in time between the two resolutions. But if the second resolution failed to win a majority, how soon could that school board reconsider whether to discontinue the school? It must be able to do so at some stage in the future. That second resolution should not be taken as a judgment for all time. If the answer is somewhere in the Bill, I hope that the Minister will forgive me for not having spotted it as I am still red-eyed from the other night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unreasonable if the board were continually faced with proposals that would be defeated. We must recognise the rights of both those who want to dissolve the school and those who do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the second resolution were passed, clause 29 provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"they may within the period of six months … publish proposals for that purpose."</p></blockquote>
and, among other things, specify the proposed date of discontinuance and state whether proposals for the establishment of a new school have been published. I have gone through clauses 29, 44, 45 and 46, looking for the answers to the questions that I am about to raise. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that it would have been more helpful if clauses 44, 45 and 46 had immediately followed clause 29. It would be more logical and coherent to consider all those issues together. Clause 44 is about winding up orders; clause 45 is about the disposal of property on winding up; clause 46 is about the transfer of a school for the establishment of a new school and clause 47 is about the disposal of surplus money on winding-up. Those serious issues would all arise out of a successful resolution under clause 29. It would have been sensible to group them together in the Bill so that they could be debated in sequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1094</span>
It is not only a matter of logical sequence. The Committee may not even get around to discussing some of those crucial clauses, and time will have to be found on the Floor of the House to consider all the unfinished business, which could include the issues that logically follow this clause. That would be unfortunate, because those issues will tend to disappear—rightly and understandably—among the bigger issues of principle in the Bill, which both sides will want to discuss on Report. Thus they may escape the scrutiny that they deserve, and serious issues may result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the school's board of management simply wished to cease business and was not interested in what became of the school and its buildings thereafter. The Bill set out various requirements for the board if it wishes to wind up. But what will happen if it simply washes its hands of the matter? What can the Secretary of State do to make it carry out those requirements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. ALLAN STEWART	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The Bill does not consider that possibility and it is difficult to know what would happen. I do not suggest that anyone would act in that way. However, the Government must recognise the possibility of a group of people who, having taken on responsibilities from the education authority, find them far more burdensome than they had ever foreseen. The group might then say, "That's it, we're winding up and that's the end of it." They may leave the Secretary of State and the local authority to work out what is to become of the school building, its pupils, staff and property.</p>
	<p>If a board of management wishes to assure the school's future, it can transfer the school to the education authority. Neither clause 29 nor the succeeding clauses that I mentioned clarify how long the local authority has to prepare for taking over the school. The Minister must have devoted some thought to that matter. If a school board suddenly decides to discontinue and hand the school over to the local authority, the Secretary of State can hardly require that it has six months to discuss the proposal and that some time after the local authority is left to get on with somehow.</p>
	<p>All sorts of problems would arise. Within a very short time, the local authority may have to recognise school rolls in the area. It would have to try to coordinate curricula or simply leave the pupils from the closed-down school to make their way as best they could in some new school, perhaps having to drop some subjects that had been specialisms in the previous school. Even if they continued the same subject, entering a class at a different level and working with different textbooks would create difficulties for the pupils, let alone the staff.</p>
	<p>Therefore, the local authority should be given decent notice of the school's closure, so that it can cope with it. It would not merely be for the sake of the local authority's convenience that should not be allowed to happen in such an inchoate and incoherent fashion—and heaven forbid that the Minister should care tuppence about the convenience of local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1095</span>
authorities—but for the convenience of pupils, those who provide a service in the school, and the parents who are worried about their children's education.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State may argue that all the proposals would need to be approved by him. But as I pointed out to him earlier, what would happen if the board said that it would do it anyway whether he approved it or not? What if it wanted to establish a new school on the premises? What if it simply sold to a company that ran schools as a private business? Presumably such a school would come under the same safeguards of educational standards as all other Scottish schools. Does the Minister foresee any problems arising out of that and, if so, how would he propose to deal with them?</p>
	<p>It is an interesting thought that in the space of a few years a school could change from a local authority school to one run by a school board and then to one run by a private company. The pupils and staff could go through all those immense changes perhaps in the school life of one pupil. This may seem an unimportant or irrelevant issue to some, but children who go through school aiming to gain qualifications need as much stability as possible. No one involved in the education of children should disrupt it any more than can be helped, and certainly not for mere ideological reasons. Changes of management, in attitudes towards the running of the school, in the curriculum and in the general ethos of the school could all harm a child's ability to achieve. As it is so difficult to get a second bite at the cherry and to acquire qualifications after leaving school we should be careful about creating difficulties in school.</p>
	<p>It is clear from the material that was read out to the Committee the other day that because of ideological reasons and because of his hatred of everything in the public sector the Minister is embarking on a system which he hopes will result in a large number of private sector schools. He does not want the local authorities to have an advisory role; he does not want them to have anything to do with those schools. The Minister's belief that the private sector is good and the public sector is bad is not an adequate reason to jeopardise the educational attainment of children in Scottish schools, especially as the vast majority of Scottish parents do not want this kind of schooling for their children in the first place. They will pay the price for the Minister's commitment to far-Right ideology.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will be more generous in his answers to all those questions than he was the other day. I asked many questions then and he answered only one. These are serious questions which have great import for the education of our children in Scotland. I have a note of all of them and if he fails to respond, I warn him that I shall be back on my feet to press them.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs . Fyfe). The Opposition are making important points and we want answers to them before deciding whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. We are expressing points of view that have been put to us by many people in Scotland who have read the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1096</span>
Bill in detail and are worried about the implications of clause 29. The Bill says that the Secretary of State will look at the proposals and will be involved in taking the final decision. It is possible to make representations under subsection (5), but the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made a relevant point on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Secretary of State look after the interests of the various groups that will be affected by the proposals? What will happen to staff in schools that are about to be closed? Clause 44(2)(k) says that an order may:
	<br><blockquote><p>"require the board to give notice of dismissal to persons employed by them with effect from such date as may be specified in the order".</p></blockquote>
One would assume that people receiving dismissal notices would be covered by the relevant legislation. Has the Scottish Office considered whether teachers and non-academic staff will have the right to make representations about future potential work opportunities available in education authority schools. It is unacceptable for people who may have given several years of commitment to a school to be summarily dismissed without their future employment prospects being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maryhill emphasised the educational problems arising for pupils in a school that is to be closed. If a school is to be absorbed into the education authority—which is possible under the clause—whether in the existing building or in another one, will the Secretary of State extend the education authority's budget so that it can take on the responsibilities of those additional pupils? If pupils were moved to other schools under the education authority's control would travel expenses be paid to families? Those may seem small matters, but the budgetary aspects of the clause are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that the legislation requires a full ballot of parents before a school can opt out, but does not have the same provision for when parents may wish a school to discontinue its opted-out status. Should not parents be given the opportunity to express their view in a ballot? The Minister will say that representations can be made to the Secretary of State, but parents should be more closely involved in any decision where a school proposes to discontinue its opted-out status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not be negative about the serious points that we have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Stewart, that what you call the Irish, will be pleased to see you for once in an impartial position in Committee and not making upsetting controversial remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for my late arrival but I had business in Committee Room 9.1 was trying to defend Scottish universities and Scottish local government from the changes that the English Government—or the British Government—wish to impose on universities—like making them liable for rates. I was successful because the Minister agreed that the burden of rates for Scottish universities should be borne by central Government through revenue support rather than by the taxpayers. I hope that the Minister will show consideration for people's worries about the proposals in clause 29.

I speak from experience because I was elected to Tayside regional council when it was in the middle of a school closure programme. One of the reasons that I did so well in that by-election was because it took place in an area where a primary school was about to be closed by the Tory regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents turned out in huge numbers to register their disapproval at the proposal and they voted for the main party opposed to the closures, which was the Labour party for which I was the candidate. For the first year to 15 months that I was on the regional council, the school closure programme was a matter for debate and consultation with the local electorate. It was a hard and bitterly fought campaign. Although it did not directly affect schools in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), I am sure that he will recall the impact that the closure of primary schools in Dundee had on the Tory administration of Tayside regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some will argue that we should not worry about what happens to self-governing schools because they will take the decision to go along a different educational path from everyone else. It is their affair if they wish to remove themselves from education authority control. The Bill will allow them to introduce academic selection or other characteristics. Such people say, "If they get into a hole, let them sit in it, and if they are closed, it is their problem." I do not take that attitude because the schools will remain with the public sector and the parents who send the children to them have rights which are as important as those of everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that clause 29 may introduce a restricted form of arrangements for the closure of schools which will act as a Trojan horse. If the arrangements are to apply to self-governing schools, it will not be long before the Minister says, "If we can close self-governing schools so easily, why should it take so long to close schools under education authority control? We cannot discriminate between the two sectors. We should bring them into line." If we concede the arrangements for self-governing schools, we shall slip down that slope and it will be easier to close education authority schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 29 contains the closure mechanism. Two resolutions have to be passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The interval between the first and the second resolution may be as short as 28 days. As I said earlier, I find that unacceptable. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) called the first stage the trigger mechanism, and that is the only time at which parents have a real chance of persuading those who have taken the decision to close the school. At that point, the decision lies with the board of management. After the decision is made, it passes outwith the democratic control of the parents and to the Secretary of State for Scotland whom they cannot directly influence. At least, parents can directly control the board of managment's actions.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1098</span>
	<p>I shall underline the value of the direct link between decision makers and their electorate. I have already referred to Tayside regional council. If the Minister knows anything about Scottish politics, he will be aware that for a long time the Tory administration on Tayside was regarded as a jewel in the Tory crown. There had been 11 years of uninterrupted rule and no one seriously believed that it would ever lose control of the council. But, that was before the Tory administration embarked on a policy of school closures which was unpopular and resisted by the parents, children and communities that it affected. The administration lost power at the next regional council elections and it was defeated on the issue of the closure of primary schools. The Tories paid the price for closing popular schools. I have looked for, but cannot see, that type of mechanism in clause 29. As the clause stands, parents will have just 28 days to mount a campaign to convince the boards of management not to proceed with the closure of a school.</p>
	<p>As I understand it, there could be as little as four weeks between the first and second resolution, followed by perhaps a minimum period of a month during which the proposal would be published. After that, there could be two months for consultation with anyone who wished to make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland, and perhaps another month for him to make a decision. Therefore, in as short a period as five months, the school could effectively be closed. Throughout that period of five months, the parents would have only 28 days in which to try to change the mind of the board of management.</p>
	<p>However, that is the minimum period for the closure, and it would be possible to have a longer period, such as six weeks, in which the two resolutions could be passed, up to six months before the proposals would be published by the board of management, another two months for consultation and another month for the Secretary of State. Therefore, the procedure could take almost a year.</p>
	<p>If the board of management instituted such a procedure, which could take almost a year to implement, would it be possible for 10 per cent, of parents—the figure required—to submit a resolution to the board of management asking for a new balloted procedure on the proposal to close the school? Would it be possible to have a sort of by-election to the board of management on the issue of whether the current board was correct to maintain the decision to close the school?</p>
	<p>The timescale for closure is less than a year. There would be a minimum of at least a year between different elections to the board of management. If a board was forcing a closure through within 12 months, would the Secretary of State for Scotland allow sufficient parents to submit a resolution to the board of management? That would enable fresh elections to be held, with a view to electing to office people who would have the chance to reverse the original decision taken by the board of management, and save the school from closure.</p>
	<p>The Minister has not conceded the fact that, once the board of management has taken that decision,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1099</span>
there is nothing that parents or local people can do about it thereafter. It is nonsense to say that they have the right to make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland. Anyone can do that at any time. He or she can write to their Member of Parliament or the Secretary of State directly, who will listen to whatever they have to say and then ignore it. There must be some way of making the decision-makers listen. As we have found to our cost in Scotland, there are few ways in which we can make the Secretary of State listen to what the people of Scotland want. He just goes ahead regardless.</p>
	<p>Those who disagreed with the board's closure decision should be able to call for fresh elections on whether the proposal should go ahead through the trigger mechanism of the dual resolution. I hope that the Minister will make clear that ultimately the decision should lie with the parents and not with any board of management.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) pointed out—and the Minister conceded—that the matter is not just about closure, but discontinuance. A group within the board of management might decide to remove the school not only from local authority control, but from the public sector altogether. Thus it would no longer be a public sector school, but would move into the private or independent sector.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) tried unsuccessfully to move an amendment that would have given rights to independent schools similar to those of self-governing schools. It would then have been possible for schools to move into the independent sector, while continuing to receive public funds. A group within a board of management could be trying to achieve that. Therefore, defences must be built into the mechanism to prevent people hijacking the school and removing it from the public sector. It is important that before a major discontinuance decision is taken, the board of management must seek the approval for such a change from the electorate of parents.</p>
	<p>I am also puzzled by the detailed description of the mechanism for discontinuance. Clause 29 states that after deciding on discontinuance by passing the two resolutions, the board of management "may"— not "shall"—publish its proposals to that effect
	<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as may be required by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
but that they "shall" be submitted to him. Perhaps the Minister will explain the inconsistency. The clause continues in the same vein. Subsection (4) states that the published proposals
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall specify the proposed date of discontinuance … and shall be accompanied by a statement"</p></blockquote>
and that any person
	<br><blockquote><p>"may submit representations to the Secretary of State in respect of the proposed discontinuance."</p></blockquote>
The clause switches from "may" to "shall". How can the Secretary of State or the Minister propose a mechanism whereby a board of management can decide to trigger the closure of a school but not have to publish proposals for consultation with parents if it does not want to? Unless we amend the clause, the board of management could take a decision, pass it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1100</span>
on to the Secretary of State for Scotland and not tell anyone else what it was doing. If the clause does state that the board must publish its proposals, I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me where.</p>

I might have misread the clause, but I am merely asking the Minister to consider my suggestion. Even the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is an argument on the Front Bench when an hon. Member is trying to raise a point of order.

Gentleman's constituency is Brigg and Cleethorpes and he should be referred to properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only wish that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes was as passionate in defending the interests of Scottish parents and children as he is about defending the name of his constituency. Unfortunately, he is not, as we know to our cost. Before the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes intervened and tried to delay the Committee on unimportant matters I was making a substantial point to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can make some progress. The hon. Gentleman said that he has only just looked at the clause—I am not criticising—and thinks that a problem may arise on the word "may". If the board does not publish proposals, there will be no proposals to submit to the Secretary of State and so cannot proceed with closure. So there is no question of discontinuance occurring without proposals being published. The use of "may" is perfectly appropriate, because proposals will be published only if the board wishes to discontinue the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a strange explanation. I understood that the decision to confirm whether to trigger the mechanism to discontinue the school would go ahead after the second resolution. I thought
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1102</span>
that it was at that point that the board of management decided that the mechanism should go ahead, but now the Minister is suggesting an entirely new situation. Having taken the first decision to pass a resolution and confirmed that within 28 days—or 42 days, as it will be now—thereafter it would still be within the board's remit to say, "We shall not bother to do it, lads. We shall not publish the proposals. It does not have to go ahead." That is what the Minister seems to be saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. Even after the second resolution has been passed, the board could—I accept that it is unlikely—decide not to publish its proposals. If it does not, that is the end of the matter. The required procedure must be continuous. It requires a first resolution, and a second resolution followed by publication of the proposals. It is to allow the board to change its position after it has passed the second resolution that the word "may" is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by that reply. It casts a new light on some of my fears about the clause. The Minister has confirmed that within a period of up to seven months it is open to any board of management to change its mind on its original decision to trigger the mechanism to discontinue the school. It is encouraging to know that there will be such a long period in which the board can change its mind. Nobody would try to keep a school open if its population had declined to such an extent that in a sense it closes itself, but if there is disagreement about proposals to close a school, I hope that the Minister, his Department and everyone concerned will publicise the fact that they expect the board not to go ahead with the decision until the full 42 days has expired and until it has taken advantage of the full six-month period. It should not make a move to publish the proposals until the end of the six-month period. I hope that the Minister will accept that that is a sensible approach if there is disagreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mystery is not resolved. Presumably if, after the second resolution, the board decided not to draw up its proposals, it would not be a matter of individual members of the board not getting round to it. The board would have to meet and decide that although it had passed the second resolution and could draw up proposals it declined to do so because it had changed its mind. In that case, a third resolution would be required to undo the second resolution. That provision should be in the Bill, or it is a strange decision-making procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is incredibly stange. My hon. Friend has seen a flaw in the Minister's answer that I did not notice. The board contains people who have been elected to that office. If it decides to pass the resolution, it will meet again within 28 or 42 days to take a second decision and will pass that decision to its executive arm. We do not know who that may be—a bursar may be told to go ahead and arrange publication of the proposals. Will the decision on whether to publish the proposals within six months lie with the bursar or will the board have to meet again to agree a publication date? The Bill is sloppy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1103</span>
on this important matter. The procedure to close a school contains many ambiguities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister proposes that after the second resolution has been passed, the executive arm of the board of management will decide whether to go ahead. If he forgets to publish within six months, is that it? If the bursar makes a mistake or falls ill there is no mechanism by which the proposals can be confirmed at a later date. The period of 28 or 42 days is far too short. Why have a limit of six months for the publication of proposals? The Minister said that it will allow the board to think again, but how does it express its second, third or fourth thoughts about its original decision to close the school? It is nonsense that such important legislation has so many uncertainties and ambiguities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admitted that the clause deals not only with closures but with discontinuance. He conceded that a school could decide to go back under the control of the education authority. The possibility of opting back in was hailed as a great concession when we first discussed opting out in Scotland. The Minister was not going to allow schools to opt back in, but now he says that they will be allowed to do so. We take it that this is the process by which they will be allowed to opt back in. The board of management will pass the two resolutions, publish the proposals and put them to the Secretary of State for Scotland and to the education authority. Everyone will be able to make representations to the Secretary of State, who will then make a decision. He can reject the decision to opt back in without modification. What sort of concession is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board of management may be unanimous on the first and second resolutions and have the overwhelming support of the parents to opt back into education authority control and the education authority may welcome the school back under its control, but under the Bill the Secretary of State for Scotland could still say no. Does the Minister think it fair, if the school, parents, children and education authority all want to come back under education authority control, that the Bill should allow the Secretary of State to say, "I do not care what you want. You are not going back to education authority control, because I want you to remain under my direct control." If the Minister does not think that that is fair, why is that the only way that a school can opt back in to education authority control? Why is there no way of leaving the decision to those who should be deciding—the parents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a lot in earlier debates about the rights of parents. We were told by Conservative Members that this was a permissive Bill, that no one had the power to force anyone to do anything and that the parents could do just about anything they wanted. However, when there is a possibility that parents may want to do something that Conservative Members do not want them to do, such as opting back in to education authority control, it is not for the board of management, the parents or the education authority to decide. The Secretary of State for Scotland alone can decide, no matter what the evidence, that a school will not be allowed to opt back in to education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1104</span>
The Minister or the Secretary of State said somewhere along the line that only in exceptional circumstances would schools be allowed to opt back in. What are those exceptional circumstances? Does the Minister concede that if the board of management and the parents are overwhelmingly in support of such a decision, the Secretary of State has no right to say no to allowing a school to opt back in? I suspect that the Minister will concede nothing of the kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the same with this clause as it is with every other clause in the Bill. The Government are not concerned with what is wanted by the people of Scotland, the parents and the education authorities, which are elected by the people of Scotland. They are concerned only with what the No Turning Back group of Conservative Members wants. That is what the Bill is about. It is just a stage post on the way to the conter-revolution, which the Minister has always wanted to carry through, to disrupt and destroy public education in Scotland. That is why I shall listen closely to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is very important. I do not know what the Minister meant by saying to journalists that we have dealt with all the controversial clauses. I may be wrong, and should welcome the Minister's assurance that he does not believe that to be the case, and that there are many controversial clauses yet to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that what I was reported as saying was that all the controversial aspects of self-governing schools have been covered in the Bill. There is nothing controversial about the arrangements for the discontinuance of self-governing schools, which provided for opting back into the system. There were strong representations on that point during the consultation stage. Judging by the number of Opposition amendments tabled, the controversial parts of the Bill have already been covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions allow schools not only to opt back into the system, but to opt out of the system entirely and become independent. That opens up a new controversy. Even the mechanism by which the discontinuation of the school is operated and the closure decided is deeply controversial, given the almost complete absence of the ability of parents to influence directly the discontinuation proposals. I examined clause 29, but I saw no mention of the great balloting procedures that the Minister says are crucial to parental involvement and democracy. There is no word about the parents' vote or simple majorities. The process is dubious, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going into the substance of those procedures, I shall comment on simple errors in the clause. I am not making any specific point about them, but they raise questions. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East discussed the use of the word "may" rather than "shall" in subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1105</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was the duty of the Opposition to improve legislation as it goes through the House. Opposition Members have discussed the use of "may" and "shall" and have pointed out errors in the clause. If the hon. Gentleman believes that he is on the Committee to improve the Bill, he is failing in his duty by not tabling any amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has made that point before. Opposition amendments have been considered and disposed of. We are now discussing clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised this point yesterday when discussing a Government amendment to clause 29. A drafting error can often be missed but, when picked up, can raise questions. I received no explanation yesterday, and the explanation put forward by the Minister just now is not wholly reasonable. The clause makes provision for a first resolution by a board of management, when it decides that it wishes to initiate the procedures, and for a second decision, encapsulated in a second resolution. Then the board of management may or may not publish proposals in accordance with its two previous decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that it is open to boards of management not to do that. I should expect them to make a third decision that they will not publish the proposals—that they had tried to work out what the proposals would involve, but that once they had got down to the nitty-gritty, they did not like the look of them. Any third decision should be encapsulated in a third resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not be up to individual members of a board of management to decide separately not to draw up the proposals, so that, out of sheer inertia or apathy, the board never draws up any proposals. Presumably, a board of management takes a collective decision not to draw up proposals. Although the clause mentions the first two decisions, it does not mention such a collective decision. That is really a drafting problem and does not raise any substantive points, apart from the general point of principle raised by the whole clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further mystery is created by subsection (6), which deals with the possible responses by the Secretary of State to a set of proposals submitted to him. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, after considering any representations submitted under subsection (5) above, reject any proposals under this section, approve them without modification or, after consultation with the board of management, approve them with modifications".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (7) lists what the Secretary of State can do if he approves proposals under the clause. One naturally expects to find a subsection (8) on the next page describing what would happen if the Secretary of State did not approve the proposals and said that no matter how the proposals were modified he did not think that the school should be discontinued. Subsection (6) gives the Secretary of State the option of vetoing proposals. What happens then? Where is subsection (8)? We are entering uncharted territory here. Unfortunately there is no straightforward provision in the Bill and the board would have to infer what it should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1106</span>
If the board of management decided to discontinue and drew up and submitted proposals to the Secretary of State, it would be odd if the Secretary of State said that it had to continue to operate as before. There could be a deadlock between the Secretary of State and this reluctant board of management which just wants to give up the ghost. We need some guidance about what would happen if a deadlock were reached. Could the Secretary of State call for fresh elections to the board of management? Could the board of management collectively resign? What if it just insisted that the school be discontinued and said that it would dig in its heels until the Secretary of State accepted the decision? The whole status of the school and the board of management is questionable at this stage. It would have been better had the clause laid out precisely what should happen if the Secretary of State rejected the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems in working out the implications of the clause, as my hon. Friends have pointed out, is that other clauses which would seem immediately relevant to it are scattered at other points in the Bill. The Minister said that we cannot use the Committee as a tutorial. I learn constantly on this Committee. One of the things that I would like to learn is why the clauses on discontinuing schools are scattered about. Apart from clause 31 the clauses that follow have nothing to do with discontinuance; they relate to other matters of the school while it is operating. We then come back to discontinuance in clauses 44 to 47.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend realises that I have already pointed that out. There is some logic in the succession of clauses that lead up to clause 29. Clause 26 is on the recovery of sums in respect of a grant; clause 28 concerns changes in the schools's characteristics. It could be said that the next logical matter is the school's discontinuance. But the Bill then deals with matters such as the withdrawal of grant and financial matters related to changes in characteristics and discontinuance, and that leads up to clause 44. I agree that clause 29 should probably have been clause 43. That would have created a better flow of events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not have been a better flow of events. I am sure that there is a reason for it. I enjoy the Committee so much because, as a relatively new Member, I learn a lot in our debates. I am sure that Conservative Members also learn a lot—perhaps not about drafting legislation, but I hope about Scottish education, although they do not show much evidence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand clause 29, and that is why the Minister can say that it is uncontroversial. It is physically detached from later clauses that cover setting up independent schools, which could be a direct consequence of the operation of the mechanism in the clause. If the provisions to set up independent schools immediately followed clause 29, the controversial implications of the clause would be apparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The failure of the Government's approach is the lack of parental input in the decision-making process,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1107</span>
not only on the discontinuance of schools but more crucially on the options of what may happen afterwards. Clause 29 is the only place in the chain of events where parents can have a say. In later clauses which discuss whether a school should be set up as an independent school, local authority school or technology academy, no input from parents is allowed. If parents are to participate in any later decisions on the school's future, a provision must be written into clause 29. Given the importance of those subsequent decisions, parental input in clause 29 is pathetic. It does not mention the balloting procedure that has been paraded elsewhere in the Bill. The only opportunity for parents to have a direct say before the board of management decides—it could be a fateful decision for the school, given the range of futures available—is in the period between the two resolutions. Thereafter, they can simply make representations to the Secretary of State like any other member of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period between the two resolutions is lacking because of its brevity and its limitations in terms of the information and options available to parents. It is evident in the notes on clauses that the period between the two resolutions is too brief because it described parents as giving their immediate reactions to the proposition that a school should discontinue. Even the Government acknowledge how inadequate that period of time is because parents will only be able to give their immediate reaction. That is not good enough because the Secretary of State's decision is about not only the potential closure of a school, but numerous other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timescales could be very brief. Subsection (2)(a) deals with the first and second resolutions. The period between them could be six weeks or as short as four weeks. It is no wonder that the notes on clauses describe the parents' reaction as immediate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(a) describes how the proposals will be published four weeks after the second resolution. There is no requirement that the board of management delays publication. Therefore, the board could publish its proposals on the day of the second resolution. There may not even be any warning. The board could drop the resolution like a bombshell on parents and the proposals could be published as soon as four weeks later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) provides for representations to be made to the Secretary of State in which parents have no privileged status. The period specified in subsection (5) is two months. The Secretary of State may give parents and others two months in which to write in, telephone and hold demonstrations, but immediately after those two months, the Secretary of State can put his decision into effect. The Secretary of State can make his decision after two months and the board of management can publish its proposals after one month. Therefore, the whole process could take as little as three months from beginning to end. That is appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tell us about the local government's failure to consult people when it takes decisions, but it is disgraceful and shocking for a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1108</span>
consultation process to be able to take as little as three months to conceive and execute. Opposition Members are wholly justified in saying that the consultation and decision-making period is too brief to allow parents to reflect upon what is happening to their school, decide what option they want to pursue and put their case to the Secretary of State or the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not only that the consultation period is too brief, but that its scope is too limited. That window of opportunity between the two resolutions is the only period during which parents have a privileged say in the matter. In that one-month or six-week period they have no idea what the proposals contain. All they have is a resolution. They have no idea why the board of management wants to discontinue the school. That is not obvious because the board has a range of options once the school is discontinued. It could be put under education authority control or be given independent or technology academy status, but parents will be in the dark about those options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want uncertainty, but we must ensure that we do not remove parents' rights. Even if parents accept proposals that we are not happy with, they still have rights and it is not in our nature to remove rights from parents just because they do not have the same philosophy and beliefs as us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the school has opted out and is still under the control of the Secretary of State, it could go independent. We would oppose that and we would be wholeheartedly on the parents' side. Does my hon. Friend agree that in such a case, parents would need more than the time prescribed by the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend almost negates the need for me to continue making these points, but I would like to put them into my own words. Given the fate that could descend on the heads of these unfortunate parents, more time and, more importantly, more information should be available to them. It is not good enough for them to have four to six weeks to give their opinions when they do not know what the proposals are. They are asked, "Do you want this to happen, yes or no?" and when they ask, "What is to happen?" they are told, "We won't tell you until you tell us yes or no. We're not going to publish the proposals until after you have decided whether you like them." They must decide on proposals that they have not even seen. That is absurd. The Government's claim that the Bill is about parental power and choice is nonsense. Without information and knowledge, parents have no choice and no power. The implications are considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on later clauses that are relevant to this clause, such clause 45, say that if a school is discontinued, the property should return to the education authority. That will not necessarily be the case. Clause 46 clearly provides for the Secretary of State to transfer the property to a new independent school such as a technology academy. To what other type of new independent school could the property
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1109</span>
be transferred, if the self-governing school is discontinued? I do not want to consider the pros and cons of future clauses, such as clause 46, although I am mindful of the fact that we could be denied a proper debate on them because of the Government's wish to rush through the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those issues are relevant to clause 29. One of the implications of clause 46 is that a new independent school could introduce fees for education. That is something that parents should know and it is the type of information that clause 29 should give them the right to have. Parents might say, "Yes, we will discontinue" if they have read the notes on clause 45, which state that the normal expectation is that the property of the board of management will return to the education authority. Parents might assume that the board of management wishes to revert to education authority status and for that reason they might instruct the board to pass a second resolution. Once that resolution is passed, the board will publish its proposals and parents might discover that they suggest entirely different arrangements. For example, there might be a proposal for an independent fee-paying school, which was not in the minds of the parents at all. In that case, what opportunities will parents have to express their views?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason that the Minister can give to suggest that such an expression of views would be redundant is based on the assumption that the board of management will reflect parents' views. That will not necessarily be so. Not all members of the board of management will be directly elected by parents and even those that are will not always reflect the views of their constituents. The Government tell us that local government is out of step with what people want even though members of councils are directly elected. If that happens with local government, surely it might happen with the boards of management. A board of management will not have a special status to elevate it above the type of failures to which local government is prey. The Government, in moments of modesty, would admit that even they are prey to failure occasionally. Boards of management will not be able to escape from, what I term the normal failures of the democratic process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that local government sometimes tries to distort the views of local people and that it passes byelaws that are contrary to the public's wishes. It sometimes tries to pull the wool over the eyes of local people. That might be true of boards of management, too, if they contain majorities made up of people of a particular ideological bent. The burden of my complaints about the clause is that such people will have ample scope to pull the wool over parents' eyes. Once they have done that, parents are left with no redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To exercise one's imagination and postulate the worst possible motives to a future Secretary of State and a future board of management, one could imagine them sitting down together—presuming that there was some communication between them—and the Secretary of State suggesting that they make a school fee-paying and independent or turn it into one of his new technology academies. The board of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1110</span>
management might agree but would be concerned that the parents would not wear it. The Secretary of State could reply, "Just pass a resolution and make the parents think that the school is going back under local authority control, pass a second resolution and Bob's your uncle." There need be no balloting of parents, democracy or a simple majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend appears to be suggesting that the circumstances that he is describing would be unlikely to arise. He must know that it happens at the moment, for example, between the Scottish Office and Paisley grammar. It is normal for the Minister to telephone discontented parents in Strathclyde or elsewhere to try to make a collusive deal with them. What my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the fortunes of representing my constituency is that I am far removed from the Machiavellian manoeuvres that seem to occur in central Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves this point, will he reflect on the possibility that there could be controversy even among those who wish to make a school fee-paying? There could be a division between those wanting to aim at relatively modest fees and an affordable uniform and equipment and those who want to make it a school with high fees and expensive uniforms so that it appeals to an elite drawn from a much wider area than the school's usual catchment area. The circumstances that my hon. Friend is describing could lead to very unexpected results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's response will be brief as the question was a little wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) says, parents embarking on the discontinuation process are embarking on a magical mystery tour over which they have no control. The clause is wholly inadequate. It is beyond amendment and is fit only to be rejected. Even within the terms of the Government's principles of parent power and choice it fails miserably. Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain the oddities of drafting. We await his reply with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have hit upon some of the hidden aspects of clause 29. My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said that this is such a hopeless clause that the kindest thing to do would be to vote against it. We tabled two minor amendments which were dealt with on other clauses. Our main concern is that the Government intend that opting out should be a one-way ticket. They have no desire to see an opted-out school coming back into the education authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1111</span>
sector. Not surprisingly, the clause is constructed in such a way that opting out cannot be reversed through the democratic procedures which permeate other clauses in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause reveals the Government's longer-term programme for privatisation of education. A one way ticket for opting out, means that once schools are under centralised control, the Minister and the Government have a powerful political weapon for controlling them and encouraging them into other areas of the private sector. The double standards here are extremely important. There will be ballots of parents on decisions to opt out and to change the characteristics of a school. That is democratic and it ensures that decisions are taken only when a majority of parents want it. At an earlier stage of the Committee the Minister accepted the principle that that should reflect a wide view within the parental group and not just a simple majority on the first ballot. He undertook to consider that point and come back to us. The Government clearly wish to see parents involved to a considerable extent in decision-making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the converse seems to be true of clause 29. After a school decides to opt out the board of management and the Secretary of State will be able to agree to discontinuance without the parents being involved in the decision. It does not need much elaboration to suggest that the one-way ticket will be democractic outwards from the education authority, but if there is a debate about that opted-out school moving elsewhere in the education authority sector it will be the preserve of the Secretary of State and the board of management. Our anxiety there is reinforced by the possible lack of a parental majority on the board of management. A decision about possible discontinuance could arise but there could be no wider balloting of parents and the composition of the board of management could be such that the decision was taken by a non-parental majority. There is clearly a problem for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must stress the reasons why a school would want to discontinue. There has been much talk about parents, choice, participation and involvement. But at times there has not been much debate about children. If a school can consider discontinuance once it has opted out, what impact could that process have on the children? That lends credibility to the criticisms that have been made of this woolly clause by my hon. Friends. It attempts to provide a set of circumstances and procedures for discontinuance, but it is faulty, because it does not hint at the basis for that. The decision should not be left to the board of management and then be discussed by the Secretary of State. The Opposition have little faith in the non-ideological considerations of Scottish Office Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school might decide that it wished to discontinue as an opted-out school, and the Minister could say no, under the powers given to him by the Bill. That is tremendously worrying. What would happen? Would the board of management resign and leave the school without parent-teacher co-opted leadership? Would the board decide to discontinue as an opted-out school regardless of the Secretary of State? What
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1112</span>
would the Secretary of State do? I have not read any procedures that would cover either of those possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third possibility. The opted-out school might decide, after venturing into that grey area for a few years, that it did not suit the children, yet the board of management and the Secretary of State might decide to slog it out. None of those eventualities is covered by the clause. The Government have not thought it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would an education authority, in the case of discontinuance, want to reassume control over the opted-out school? A responsible, democratically elected education authority would wish to do so. Would that be allowed? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Forgive me, Mr. Hogg, but the Minister seems to be preparing a press release. That is all part of the rich tapestry of Committee work, but I hope that the Minister is listening to the Opposition's anxieties about clause 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause presupposes that the education authority will welcome the school back with open arms. That is a real possibility. If a school opts out, the key consideration is the welfare and education of its pupils, regardless of the views of the Secretary of State and the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not reflect the potential problems that could lead to discontinuance, or the ensuing consequences, which would result in a variety of options for the board of management and the Minister. I hope that the Minister will address those essential issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.
