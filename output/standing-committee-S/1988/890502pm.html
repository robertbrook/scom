	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 283, in page 28, line 34, after "may" insert
	<br><q><p>"within one month of so doing".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 299, in page 28, line 34, after "section", insert
	<br><q><p>"after consultation with the local authority".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to raise some serious issues. The amendment deals with the time scale within which these events may take place. We do not want those matters to drag on without a time limit, so we propose that the phrase "within one month" should be included. We want to open up the point for discussion. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) cannot hear the proceedings and I am surprised to say that neither can I. I am not blaming that on the Conservative Members who are talking, although they are a little loud, but I wonder whether an external noise is causing the problem. If the fans are causing problems, we shall turn them off, but it is a warm afternoon and we may turn them on again, in which case everyone will have to speak a little louder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on an event in England where similar legislation has been passed? Two schools, one for boys and one for girls, under the name of Haberdashers' Aske's school, are funded by the Inner London education authority but controlled by a local board of management. There is a proposal before that board that the school should become a city technology college. It is believed that the majority of parents of children at the boys' school approve of the proposal but the majority of parents of children at the girls' school disapprove of it. Instead of taking the vote separately, because they are two separate schools, the chairman of the board of governors has decided to take the two votes together in order to win a majority for the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I never thought that the day would come when I would defend that girls' school, but we have not foreseen the risk of the wishes of one group of parents being flouted because two separate schools are under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1184</span>
the same board of management and some people have a bee in their bonnet and have other ideas for the schools, which they will force through. The Minister tells us to trust the parents. Which parents should we trust, those who want the school to be converted to a city technology college or those who do not? What about the education of the girls? Not only will they lose their school, but their parents' wishes will be flouted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently heard of another school where a 55 per cent, ballot resulted in a 9:1 vote against the school becoming a city technology college. The local education authority would prefer it to be a city technology college, so it is paying no attention to the parents' wishes. In such cases under the Bill, the Secretary of State for Scotland would decide on winding-up proposals. Clause 44 states that proposals could be approved under clause 29 and notice could be given under clause 31. The chairman of a board of governors could then decide that he wanted to take action which was apparently within the terms of this legislation, but which actually rode roughshod over parents' wishes. At that point, the Secretary of State should become involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in one case in England, the Secretary of State for Education and Science is ignoring parents' wishes, although a ballot has taken place. In the other case, the parents of the pupils at the girls' school are being ignored. As far as I know, the Secretary of State has not commented on that and seems prepared to sit back and allow the chairman of the board of governors to ride roughshod over those parents' wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not merely technical. An issue of principle is involved and we are interested to hear what the Minister would do in Scotland if such circumstances were to arise. In our discussions so far, it has not occurred to us that the Minister could ignore the parents' ballot or that the ballot could be gerrymandered. There is no other word for what is happening at Haberdashers' Aske's school. How would the Minister deal with those problems? If he would consider rewording the clause, he could use it to prevent such abuses. The amendment is not just technical; it raises serious points of principle to which I hope that the Minister will respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 283 would oblige the Secretary of State to make a winding-up order within one month either of approving proposals made by a board of management under clause 29 for the self-governing school to be discontinued, or of announcing his intention, under clause 31, to cease to maintain such a school. That would mean that in a case under clause 31(2)(a), where seven years has to elapse from the date of the Secretary of State's notice of his intention to cease to maintain a school before his grant can finally be withdrawn, the winding-up order would have to be made six years and 11 months before the dissolution of the school. A great deal could happen in that period, affecting the circumstances of the school and the administrative requirements in respect of its winding up, yet under amendment No. 283 all would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1185</span>
have to be ossified in a single order made years beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that if any amendment were required, it would be one to prevent the Secretary of State from making winding-up orders until some time reasonably near the date of dissolution of the school, and I should be prepared to do that if the Opposition consider it desirable. I should also be prepared to consider an amendment designed to ensure that any winding-up order would not be unreasonably delayed but for the reason given the amendment is not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 283 is also misconceived in that it presupposes that only one winding-up order would be made under clause 44 in respect of any particular school. However, that would not be the case in practice, as not only does clause 44 permit more than one winding-up order in respect of a particular school, but it envisages that there should be more than one such order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 44(1) the Secretary of State may "by order" make provision for the winding up of a school. Although clause 44(2) refers to "an order", under the Interpretation Act 1978 the use of the singular in a statutory provision includes the plural. Under clause 44, it is envisaged that an initial winding-up order would be made. That could provide for, among other things, the discharging of the board of management's liabilities and could also impose other duties on the board. Under a further winding-up order, the Secretary of State would appoint a dissolution date, which he would do, as required under clause 44(3), only when satisfied that all liabilities of the board had been discharged and that the board had complied with all other obligations imposed on it in respect of the winding-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 299 would require the Secretary of State to consult the "local authority" before making any winding-up order. I accept that that makes sense. I have to advise the Committee that the amendment is technically incorrect: it should refer to the "education authority" rather than the "local authority", but if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) will withdraw it, I undertake to produce an equivalent amendment at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting memo from the civil servants. Unfortunately, it does not answer my questions. I raised two topics with reference to two specific schools in England and asked whether such events could transpire in Scotland and whether the Minister would ensure that such abuses did not happen in Scotland. As he has failed to respond, I shall repeat my questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Haberdashers' Aske's school is two separate schools, one for boys and one for girls. Parents are being balloted on whether it should be converted to a CTC. The majority of parents at the boys' school are in favour but the majority of parents at the girls' school are not. It appears that the ballot is being conducted jointly to achieve the results desired by the chairman of the board of governors. Is that a fair way to treat the girls' school? Could something
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1186</span>
similar happen in Scotland and, if so, could the Bill prevent such an abuse, assuming that the Minister considers it an abuse?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other question was about Sylvan school in Croydon, where in a 55 per cent, turnout parents voted by more than 9:1 against the school being turned into a CTC. However, the Secretary of State for Education and Science has refused to accept the parents' verdict and has not undertaken to trust them as the Under-Secretary frequently assured us that he would. Would he follow the line taken by the Secretary of State or would he strike out for a fair procecure in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not mere idle curiosity. Under the Bill, parents will be able to vote on all types of issues. We were assured that a majority of one was sufficient, but we now learn that in England and Wales, if the Secretary of State does not like the verdict, he overrides it. Clause 44 gives the Secretary of State for Scotland powers to wind up a school, so we need to know how he will proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard what the hon. Lady said but did not respond because neither of her questions had anything to do with the amendments. I thought that at least she would have the grace to acknowledge that I had agreed to accept one of them. What she described as a memo from civil servants was a response to amendments that she had tabled in her name and those of her hon. Friends, and to which she did not speak. I responded to them because I thought that the Committee might be interested in the substance of the amendments and the Government's attitude to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Lady's questions about ballots, it would have been appropriate to raise them when we debated the provisions dealing with ballots. I do not intend to follow her down the byways of balloting procedure, which we have already discussed at length. Opposition Members wish to delay the proceedings and waste time, but I shall not tango with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On technology academies and balloting schools in respect of CTCs, I urge the hon. Lady to make the speech that she has just made and to ask the questions that she has asked when we reach clause 62, and the sooner, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that you did not rule my comments out of order, Mr. Hogg, and I prefer to accept your direction rather than the Minister's. Furthermore, I need no lessons in grace from the Minister for the far Right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as the Minister does not intend to distance himself from the unjust goings-on in those two English schools, there is nothing more to be said. The Minister has shown his attitude, but because we have made a point about timing and because the Minister has undertaken, however briefly, to accept that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 286, in page 29, leave out lines 15 to 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment omits subsection (2)(k), which requires
	<br><q><p>"the board to give notice of dismissal to persons employed by them with effect from such date as may be specified in the order".</p></q>
That sounds severe because the assumption is that the only option is redundancy. The amendment is a probing amendment to find out the Minister's opinion. We assume that those dismissed will have a right to go before a tribunal if they consider that they were unfairly dismissed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in Scotland during the past few years two list D schools were wound up; I believe that they were in Dundee. One was Balgay and the other Balgowan. The Minister has a lot to answer for because my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was made redundant when Balgowan was wound up. He has gone from rack and ruin to chasing along the corridors in Westminster. I have never asked him what he thought of the closure, but he was made redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was published, the Minister said that it would be possible for opted-out schools to return to an education authority. As I understand the Bill, it seems that there is no straightforward way for a self-governing school to do so, if the parents so desire. The only way seems to be through the winding-up procedure in clause 44. That aspect is obscure. What is the machinery for opting back in? Is it only the provisions in clause 44 or are there other means? What is the purpose of paragraph (k)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment to elicit what will happen to members of staff if a school is wound up. I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) about staff in a self-governing school that is wound up, should such an event ever take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 286, if implemented, would not improve the position of staff on the winding-up of such a school. In the event of a self-governing school being wound up, the board of management would cease to exist, so the staff of the school would also cease to have an employer. They would, in effect, be dismissed whether or not they had received notice. At present, clause 44(2)(k) provides that a winding-up order made by the Secretary of State may require a board of management to give notice to its employees of the effective date of their dismissal. The measure is designed to protect the interests of staff by giving them clear notice of when their current employment inevitably would end, through the dissolution of the board of management. Amendment No. 286 would remove that protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that the education authority is able to offer suitable alternative employment from the point at which the staff cease to be employed at the board of management, their continuity of employment is guaranteed. One purpose of the provision is to ensure that, as far as possible, the date of dismissal is suitable from the point of view of continuity; that is to say, that the board does not dismiss staff prematurely in anticipation of the wind-up. Much will depend on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1188</span>
the circumstances in which a self-governing school is wound up, as to the re-employment of the school's staff—this is the issue that interests the hon. Member for Dumbarton. If the school has ceased to be economic because of the small number of pupils in attendance, some redundancies may be inevitable. If, however, a school were to be wound up for managerial reasons, and were to revert to the education authority, it would, of course, be open to that authority to re-employ the school staff. For those circumstances in which staff transfer from the employment of a board of management to that of an education authority, I intend that the continuity of employment of such staff, for the purposes of potential redundancy entitlement, should be preserved. At present, that is the case where staff are in the successive employment of more than one education authority. The legal provision which produces that result is the Redundancy Payments (Local Government) (Modification) Order 1983, which I know the hon. Gentleman will have studied as carefully as I have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to extend that order to include employment with a board of management, as well as with more than one education authority, as being relevant for the purposes of continuity of employment and any redundancy entitlement which could arise some time after staff have transferred from the employment of a board of management to that of an education authority. The amendment of the 1983 order that I have proposed would also facilitate flexibility in staff movement between education authorities and boards of management in all circumstances, as well as in the case of a school being wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44(2)(k) is a provision for the protection of the interests of staff in a school that is about to be wound up and, accordingly, I am of the view that amendment No. 286, which would delete that provision and its protection, should be withdrawn. However, it was a helpful probing amendment because it enabled me to make the position clear. I hope that my answer reassures the hon. Member for Dumbarton and that, on that basis, he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the opportunity to ask the Minister whether he thinks that staff are being treated fairly under the clause. Subsection (2)(k) cannot be taken in isolation from the rest of the Bill. The Minister can masquerade as someone trying to protect the interests of staff, but he is not fooling members of the Committee and he is certainly not fooling the staff affected by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider clause 21(3), under which staff employed in an education authority school suddenly find that their employment is arbitrarily transferred to a new board of management. That subsection states:
	<br><q><p>"The contract of employment between a person to whom this section applies and the education authority by whom he is employed shall have effect from the incorporation date as if originally made between him and the board of management of the school."</p></q>
In other words, staff will have no say in the change of their employer from the education authority to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1189</span>
the board of management of a self-governing school. I fail to understand how the Minister can say that that protects the staff's interests. He is prepared for that subsection to remain part of the Bill. In fact, it is a central feature of the Bill that staff will be automatically transferred from the employ of the education authority to the employ of the new board of management even if they do not wish that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever is the hon. Gentleman proposing as an alternative? Is he suggesting that the staff should all be made redundant when the school becomes self governing and that they should not have the security that is provided by the clause? The clause is an additional protection measure. It ensures that the staff maintain their jobs and are not put in a position of uncertainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The alternative that I propose is that we tear up this horrible Bill now and all go home and forget about it. That would meet with the approval of the vast majority of the people of Scotland, who would think it a job well done on their behalf if we took that course of action. However, as that is unlikely, I am pursuing the Minister to get him to say whether he thinks that it is just that, whereas clause 21 treats staff as if they were cattle, with no say on the terms of employment under which they work, he tries to pretend that he and the Government are concerned to protect the interests of staff at the moment when a self-governing school is discontinued, for whatever reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister about the process by which staff find themselves in the employ of a self-governing school. First, they have a school board imposed on their school—not because the Government or the Minister think that school boards are good for involving parents, but because they are a necessary mechanism by which schools can opt out of education authority control. That school board may decide to hold a ballot to go for self-governing status. That decision, even if it is carried by a majority of the parents and confirmed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, is imposed upon the staff. They have no say in whether the school should go for self-governing status or whether it should stay under education authority control. The Minister does not even think that it is important to consult them on such issues; it is only when the matter is raised in Committees such as this that he thinks about it. He would never give a second thought to asking the staff whether they thought that it was a good idea that their conditions of employment should change under the Bill. The staff may find that the character of the school in which they work is changed by the self-same board of management which, under clause 28, might change it to a school based on academic selection, or to a single-sex, Moslem, Protestant or Catholic school. All sorts of changes could be imposed upon the staff who worked in a school without their being given any say in what was happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to clause 44(2)(k), the Minister has a bit of a nerve to say that he is worried about staff interests and that it is important that they be dismissed rather than find themselves with no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1190</span>
employer and no rights. Formerly, the staff were in secure jobs that were unlikely to end in redundancy, like my own experience at Balgowan list D school in Dundee. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has drawn a good analogy, because Balgowan list D school was not under education authority control. It is schools that are not under education authority control that are likely to make people redundant. That is why it is important that no school should opt out of education authority control and go for self-governing status or any other type of independent status. By doing that, the people in that school would be exposed to all the conditions that are involved in clause 44, unless it opted back in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a long debate about the seven years' notice. The Minister used the fact that seven years' notice must be given as a reason for dismissing one of our amendments, yet he was unable to give an example of where the Secretary of State would use the power to give seven years' notice of closure to a school. He does not know of any examples of when the Secretary of State might use that power, but it could affect people's employment conditions. The Minister has the effrontery to or is badly managed, or it decides to go for independent status in the independent sector does not matter. The point is that the Minister has exposed staff right down the line to the possibility of losing their jobs and of being subjected to inferior working conditions and less pay, because boards of management will be able to negotiate their own cotnracts with their employees. Then he has the effrontery in the debate on this amendment to say that he is concerned to protect staff interests. He is not concerned to protect anybody's interests except those of the Conservative party and its small, dwindling bunch of supporters in Scotland. That is the Minister's only interest, and he is not fooling any member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is only a probing amendment. We would not want to see such protection as already exists stripped away from the staff. However, it is interesting that the Minister envisages circumstances in which self-governing schools that opt out of education authority control will end up paying off the staff and turning the children back to the responsibility of the education authority. I do not believe that these schools could work. They are alien seed that will not take root in the soil of Scottish education. The Minister recognises that by including the clause, but he is not fooling anyone. We needed the excuse of the debate to make that point clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am pleased with the Minister's remarks. We seek protection for the interests of staff. We should like the education authority to have a role here, whether formal or informal.

(Modification) Order 1983. Therefore, in the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate assumes that, after a school is discontinued, the education authority will be the host taking the children and teachers back into its own sector. Yet clause 29 does not mention the education authority. The public assumption and the assumption of the education authority is that there is a way back from opted-out status into the education authority fold. However, that is not clear from the clause, even though the Minister made a clear exposition about staffing in relation to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is assumed that the education authority will be the host for children and teachers from self-governing schools that cease to function, that should be written into the Bill. We have tabled a new clause that allows such a school to return to the education authority sector, making it clear that that is to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with that in mind that my hon. Friends have tabled the amendments. The Minister has talked for the first time of the education authority being the successor authority to the self-governing school wound up under clause 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. ALICK BUCHANAN-SMITH	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is the time taken to ensure that the winding-up is complete. When my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) moved this amendment at one month's notice, it was clearly with the intention of impressing on the Minister that it is an enormous undertaking if a school opts out, and then decides that it should be wound up, either on the instructions of the Secretary of State or the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the untidy measure in clauses 29 and 44 covering the process of a school's return to education authority control. If the education authority is not to be the host for a school that discontinues, it could become independent, thereby creating major difficulties and concern for teachers and other members of staff. If a school's return to the education authority sector had been a tidy measure, our doubts would never have evolved. Our apprehensions arise because of the lack of explanation of what happens when a school discontinues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not vote against the clause, but we wished to make these important points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, we do not intend to vote against the clause, but it is important to raise several points for the Minister to clarify. He said earlier that he would consult the education authority before taking any action under the order for the winding-up of the self-governing school. That is an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1192</span>
important concession. We shall watch closely on Report for a Government amendment to that effect following the Minister's clear commitment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 refers to clause 29. We were told by Tory Back-Benchers that under that clause opted-out schools would be allowed to opt back into education authority control. I was not convinced of that argument, because whether a school opts out is not a matter for the parents, the education authority or the community in which a school is located. The power rests entirely with the Secretary of State for Scotland, who has made it clear that he will allow opting back in only under exceptional circumstances, and we have had no explanation of what those circumstances may be. Under what circumstances would the Secretary of State allow a school to opt back into education authority control and consult education authorities in the way outlined in clause 44?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 says that an order can
	<br><q><p>"stipulate a time-table for the winding up of the school"</p></q>
and it can
	<br><q><p>"appoint a date (the 'dissolution date')"</p></q>
for that school. It makes common sense that everyone should know when the school is to wind up and what the timetable will be for disposing of the property and land held by the self-governing school. But if a school is in the process of opting back into education authority control, it is essential that no direction is given under the order that does not have the full agreement of the relevant education authority. It is vital for that authority to make provision for the staff and children returning to its control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Minister to spell out how he will consult education authorities and what opportunities they will have to agree a timetable and dissolution date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44(2)(e) says that the order can
	<br><q><p>"provide for the ingathering of any land or moveable property".</p></q>
Earlier today we debated how moveable property and land would be allocated between self-governing schools and education authorities. The Minister was keen to defend the position of self-governing schools. Again, it is essential that education authorities have a full opportunity to discuss with the Secretary of State the nature of the order which specifies how land and moveable property is to be ingathered and then re-allocated to another body or back to the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember clearly my experience of Balgowan list D school in Dundee. When I first taught there in 1978, I attended a ceremony for the opening of the Larg hall, a huge sports hall erected with a £250,000 grant from the social work services group in Edinburgh. By 1982, the school was closed, leaving a four-year-old sports hall, which was a major asset to Balgowan school and education authority schools in the area. Kirkton high school, which was only 300 to 400 yards away from Balgowan school, had no sports hall and its pupils used the Larg hall during school hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the winding up of Balgowan school and the disposal of its property, the needs of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1193</span>
education authority were completely ignored. That £250,000 sports hall was demolished, as were modern classrooms, art rooms and woodwork rooms. The board of management of the school could then hand over the land unspoiled so that Barratt could build houses on it. That was most unfortunate in terms of Dundee's educational infrastructure, particularly for the pupils of Kirkton high school, who were denied access to those marvellous resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social work services group simply looked the other way when the board of management wound up the affairs of Balgowan list D school and disposed of valuable property. The group had probably borrowed the £250,000 to help build Larg hall in 1978 and had not even finished paying back the money lenders when Barratt suddenly inherited the land and could destroy the sports hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such unfortunate circumstances should not be allowed to be repeated under the Bill. Yet I fear that they will be repeated unless the Minister gives a commitment about how the land and property belonging to a self-governing school seeking to discontinue are disposed of. Whatever else happens, the public interest must always come first. We are dealing with assets that have been paid for and constructed with ratepayers' and taxpayers' money. How will the Bill avoid what happened at Balgowan school happening to any self-governing school that must be wound up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (g) states that the order can
	<br><q><p>"provide for the repayment by the board to the Secretary of State of the unexpended portion of any capital grant made by him to the board".</p></q>
That is an interesting provison. For capital grants or recurrent grants, the Secretary of State first calculates how much the school would have had, had it remained under education authority control. If he allocates a capital sum to a self-governing school, he deducts the equivalent of that capital sum from the capital allocation that he would have given to the education authority. In those circumstances, I cannot see why any money that has not been spent by the self-governing school should not be re-allocated to the education authority, which would have had the money in any case had the school remained under its control. Why should the education authority's capital allocation suffer when schools opt out of its control, but not benefit when schools opt back in?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (k) says that the order can
	<br><q><p>"require the board to give notice of dismissal to persons employed by them."</p></q>
The Minister said that that would allow education authorities to re-employ such people in their schools. That is fair where a school is opting back in because they must obviously continue to serve in that school and be employed by the education authority. But what happens when a school is winding up because it has no pupils? The education authority may not have any vacancies to offer staff who are made redundant in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister advise staff who have been forced out of the education authority's employment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1194</span>
into the employment of the self-governing school which, perhaps through bad management, goes into decline and loses pupils and eventually is closed. They are out of work because the Secretary of State for Scotland will not guarantee their employment although their employment would have been guaranteed and the Secretary of State kept out of their affairs in the first place. Staff could be made redundant because of the interference of the Minister and the Secretary of State. All that the Minister has to say is, "Tough luck, I'll make sure you get your redundancy money. Sorry lads, but it's tough at the top." That would be extremely unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) provides that any expenses or liabilities which the board of management incurs in the process of winding up the school can be covered in grants paid to it by the Secretary of State. Why is it that when the board of management incurs expenditure it receives a grant from the Secretary of State, but when the education authority incurs expenditure under the procedures of the Bill it never receives any grants? It always has to find the money from within its yearly allocation of recurrent grant. This thread runs right through the Bill. The Minister and Secretary of State continually discriminate in favour of self-governing schools and take every opportunity to discriminate against education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>This goes back to the pamphlet to which the Minister put his name in 1986, "Save Our Schools", which made out that the education authority schools were bad and had to go and that all schools should acquire self-governing status. We are dealing with a Minister and a Government who are not fair, who are not impartial and who are prejudiced against education authority schools. That is why it is important that we continue to draw attention to the way in which they deal unfairly with these schools.</p>

	<br><q><p>"(3A) The Secretary of State shall compensate the education authority for any reduction in the value of the land and property so transferred where that reduction in value has been brought about by mismanagement or wilful neglect by the board.".</p></q>
This is another probing amendment to enable us further to discuss the disposal of property on winding up. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) pointed out that there is a lack of even-handedness in the way that the education authorities are treated under the Bill. Our desire, which has permeated discussions on other clauses, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1195</span>
to ensure that, in the winding-up of a school, the education authority is entitled not only to significant consultation but to the assurance that it will not lose out with regard to its property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would discuss at great length ways to achieve that, but it would be impossible to put them into legislation. We are hoping for further assurances from the Minister that the disposal of property will be sensibly considered. There should be a balance between the adjudications of the Minister and the board of management in what ensues before the completion of the wind-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about how a self-governing school will end its commitment to self-governing status. At this stage, tabling amendments to these clauses would be a fruitless exercise. However, the amendment requires some response from the Minister to ensure that, even though Opposition Members may not be happy with any clause in the Bill, the implications of such clauses have been fully worked out by the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concern that underlies the amendment, but I do not think that the amendment will work. It is not just a question of drafting. There is no practicable way in which one could determine realistically the difference between the value of the land and the property transferred back to the education authority and the value that those assets would have had if they had not been subject to mismanagement or neglect. There might be some clear-cut cases, but be all too many would not be clear-cut. There would be dispute about whether there had been mismanagement or neglect, and dispute about whether it had caused any substantial reduction in the value of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other provisions in the Bill designed to cope with the kind of problem that the amendment highlights. Clause 31, which we debated earlier, gives the Secretary of State power to require a board of management to remedy any matters that he specifies, on the grounds that they must be remedied if the school is to be considered suitable to continue as a self-governing school. The penalty, if the board not comply, would be withdrawal of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a special provision in clause 44(2)(h) under which a winding-up order made by the Secretary of State may require the board to comply with any directions made by him. I would not expect any board of management wilfully to neglect its property in the normal course of events, but there might be a temptation to do so when the board knew that it was going to be wound up anyway. The power in clause 44 is designed specifically to ensure that the board continues to discharge all its duties and could be used to require it to attend to matters such as the maintenance, repair and replacement of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis I invite the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister accepts that there could be difficulties when this stage is reached. I am willing to withdraw the amendment; it was designed to evoke the response that we were given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1196</span>
The concerns that the Minister raises are real in that if a school is to be wound up, there could be some bloody-mindedness—if that is not too unparliamentary an expression—in the board of management's discussions. That would not normally happen, but the Minister has quite rightly accepted that all eventualities must be provided for as far as possible in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, as these issues unfold in regulations and the apparatus for providing for self-governing schools, the matter will be kept firmly to the fore. The local authority could ultimately be the net loser through not fault of the Minister or the education authority, but because of the dynamic that will surround such a long and convoluted process and that could result in assets and property being dealt with in a matter detrimental to the ongoing education of the children and to the fixed and moveable assets of a valuable community resource.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with property that has been allocated to a self-governing school and what is to happen to it if that school is wound up. The introductory note to clause 45 in the notes on clauses states that the normal expectation is that any property allocated to the self-governing school would
	<br><q><p>"revert back to the education authority"</p></q>
when that self-governing school was wound up. It continues:
	<br><q><p>"During the lifetime of the school property may have been acquired not from the education authority but from capital or other grants paid by the Secretary of State or out of funds raised separately on behalf of the school."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1197</span>
I shall deal with property that has been paid for out of funds or grants paid by the Secretary of State. I understand that any funds or grants that the Secretary of State for Scotland gives to a self-governing school will be at the expense of funds or grants that otherwise would have gone to the education authority. That means that the self-governing schools' gain is the education authorities' loss. In those circumstances, I fail to understand why, when a school is wound up, the Secretary of State and not the education authority should recover funds or grants or property associated with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am wrong in that assumption, and the Minister has an even more devious plan. I thought that self-governing schools would receive money from the Secretary of State and spend it on education for children attending those schools. Perhaps I am wrong—perhaps the Minister can envisage schools spending education funds on other purposes. Even if the money were spent on computers, text books or land, why should it not be transferred back to the education authority when the self-governing school is wound up? Why should it be transferred to the Secretary of State for Scotland? He could sell the property and dump the proceeds into the Consolidated Fund, for the Government to do with as they please. Perhaps he would subsidise the introduction of the poll tax, which is costing so much in Scotland. It would be iniquitous if money expended for educational provision in Scotland were taken back by the Secretary of State to help impose the poll tax on the people of Scotland. That would be unacceptable, but under the clause it is feasible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Secretary of State for Scotland allocates money to a self-governing school and that school is wound up, why does he, not the education authority get the money? The Secretary of State allocates only that money that he otherwise would have given to the education authority. He does not allocate additional funds. The Minister made it clear throughout our proceedings that money that goes to self-governing schools comes off that allocated to the education authority. In those circumstances, it is only fair that the money and property should go back to the education authority that would have had it if the school had remained under its control. People who raise funds for a self-governing school through the board of management do so, I hope, for the most noble of reasons—they want to improve the education provision in their area. Why should the Secretary of State or someone else realise that funding and spend it not on educational provision but on something separate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is consistent and is arguing that the Bill will improve educational provision in Scotland, why is he allowing money earmarked for education to be diverted even to the Secretary of State for Scotland for his own purposes or back to the original benefactors? If a self-governing school held a whist drive or a jumble sale on a Saturday morning and raised £600 and was then wound up, how would it return that £600 to the people who bought something
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1198</span>
at the jumble sale? The Minister may not have turned his mind to that problem yet, but he might have to if he leaves the clause unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that any money given to self-governing schools for education should be retained in the education budget and ownership of such money or property should revert to the education authority and no one else. If a self-governing school is wound up, it is assumed that its pupils will return to schools under education authority control. The Minister may have intended all along that self-governing schools, having opted out of education authority control, can at some point opt out of the state sector altogether and take with them into the independent sector all the land and moveable property. The independent sector, which left to pay for itself would not survive, would then be subsidised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I read it in "Save Our Schools", but I think that the Minister said that it was unfair that parents who pay for private education should also have to pay for state education from which their children do not benefit. He thought that that was paying twice for the same thing and was iniquitous and that something should be done about it. The clause would allow a self-governing school to opt into the independent sector and take with it all the property, computers, land, goal posts and whatever else it received from the state sector. Unless the Minister gives a favourable reply to this amendment we shall suspect the worst.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motivation for this group of amendments seems to be to give the education authority any and all surplus land or moveable property that remains on the winding-up of a self-governing school. At first sight I thought that the amendments drifted so far from a balanced approach as to produce ludicrous results. I was slightly surprised to hear the hon. Member for Dundee, East speaking in favour of the amendments with such enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 302 would require a substitution of terms in clause 45(4) to the effect that where it appears to the Secretary of State that any land or moveable property has been procured by a board of management otherwise than at the expense of the education authority and, therefore, it is appropriate on that account to exclude that land or moveable property from transfer to the authority, he may in a winding-up order transfer such property to the education authority. That is a complete contradiction and is in no way acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1199</span>
Amendments Nos. 291 and 306 are in approximately the same terms and would have the effect that any surplus money or investments of a board of management would in all cases be transferred to the education authority, to the exclusion of the Secretary of State. That result appears to be completely lacking in principle and contrasts with the balanced approach that is adopted in clause 47 as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 47(1) provides that the surplus assets will transfer to the Secretary of State. That is immediately qualified by clause 47(2) where, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the surplus assets have been in whole or in part derived from sources other than grants paid by him and that the assets ought to be transferred either to the education authority or to a third party, he may require those assets to be so transferred. Depending on the circumstances, the Secretary of State may require that any such transfer should be on the basis that the assets be held in trust for such purposes as he may specify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the provisions of clause 47 can be seen as providing a balanced, flexible approach to the problem of the redistribution of surplus assets. How those assets will be redistributed will depend on their original source. The principled approach of clause 47 can be contrasted with that of amendments Nos. 291 and 306, which have no redeeming features of fairness or balance and should be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 292 and 293 would merely extend to subsection (2) of clause 47 the same type of approach that is taken to subsection (1). Again it would be a case of all assets going to the education authority, without any possibility of the rights or wishes of a third party being recognised. Such a person may have been a generous benefactor of the school when self-governing. He may have given over funds under agreement with the board of management that they be used for particular purposes associated with that school. Clause 47 allows for recognition of the purpose for which assets have been handed over to a school. On the failure of that purpose, clause 47 permits an equitable redistribution of the assets—the amendments under consideration would not.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 308 would also restrict the Secretary of State's options in respect of surplus assets by withdrawing his power to require that such assets be transferred to an education authority or to a third party only in trust for such purposes as he may specify. The amendment would thus remove an

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being less than charitable with some of the amendments. We are trying to establish the agenda for many clauses, which are deliberately vague, to ensure that in the process of wind-up, the resources, assets and property need not revert to the education authority. Amendment No. 302 would amend the part of the clause that states:
	<br><q><p>"moveable property to such persons as may be designated in the order on such terms as may be so designated."</p></q>
In addition, amendment No. 292 seeks to delete from clause 47 the line
	<br><q><p>"transferred … to an education authority or to some other person".</p></q>
It appears that the establishment of a self-governing school is a tidy affair between the education authority and the board of managment. Looking ahead to a possible discontinuance or wind-up, one simplistically imagines property and assets being transferred back to the education authority. In the intervening period a benefactor or an organisation could have entered the picture, but what could change so much during that period that the Secretary of State or the education authority could not cope with being identified in those clauses? That would avoid our suspicion of third-party involvement and the promotion of the independent sector. If we have not misunderstood part of the agenda, why is it not made clear that when a self-governing school is discontinued or wound up, its assets will be returned to the host education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 302 and 292 are important because we are worried about the thread that we see running through the Bill. Uncharacteristically, the Minister has not dismissed them as technically incompetent but has set his face against considering the wider points of principle. I regret that the Government have not taken the amendments more seriously because we fear that a wider agenda is being played out. The Minister might say that that is merely a figment of our imagination, but the drafting of the clauses makes the return of property to the education authority very unclear. What would be the procedure and financial drawbacks or benefits for the education authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East made the valuable point that, as the principal partner in the arrangement at the start of the self-governing process, the education authority should remain the principal partner as the story unfolds. Many education authorities might feel that it is grossly unfair that they should lose their schools to self-governing status, but if those schools are to be discontinued, the education authorities should pick up the property and equipment when the process is complicated by the involvement of third parties or persons, to use the nomenclature of clauses 45 and 47.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1201</span>
Clause 46, which we are about to debate, is the main reason for our suspicions. It makes specific provisions for a "proposer" to take over a discontinued school. That puts clauses 45 and 47 into context. The initial comments made in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East have done nothing to dispel our fears and my hon. Friend will take that matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond further. I was taken aback by the Minister's claim that he had adopted a balanced approach to the issue. He is about as balanced as I shall be on 20 May when Celtic play Rangers at Hampden park in the Scottish cup final. I assure him that I do not want to see his political friend and ally, Terry Butcher, get his hands on the cup. The vast majority of the Scottish people will hope, like me, that Rangers do not win the trophy. I am unbalanced on that matter and the Minister has been unbalanced in the way that he has treated self-governing schools and education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the amendments were lacking in principle. Will he explain what principle runs through clause 45? As far as I can see, the only principle that pervades it is that money that is now earmarked to be spent for the provision of education will be allocated on almost anything except education given the powers that the Secretary of State for Scotland will have. The Minister outlined the procedure. Surplus assests will come under the purview of the Secretary of State who will decide whether they should come back to him, whether they should go to the education authority or whether they should go to a third party. The Minister even said that the Secretary of State for Scotland may set up a trust to decide how the money should be spent and he said that how it was spent would depend on its original source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then explained that the decision involved the rights and the wishes of third parties, such as benefactors who give money to particular schools for specific reasons. Will the Minister explain how the purposes of a self-governing school are different from those of an education authority school? What will self-governing schools try to do with children that education authority schools do not? If any benefactor gives money to a self-governing school to be spent on the children attending it, why cannot the money be spent just as beneficially on children who attend education authority schools? That seems reasonable to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In asking his questions perhaps the hon. Gentleman could answer his previous point. He cited the example of a popular Socialist in Dundee who left money to a school. Why could that money not be spent on a self-governing school? Why should a self-governing school not be treated in the same way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am being slow, but a benefactor who made an endowment to a self-governing school—it might be money, land or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1202</span>
property—would probably have some connection with the school. He would wish to see the money spent on it. However, if the school were to be discontinued, why should the benefactor resent that money being spent on other school children? Is the Minister saying that benefactors of self-governing schools are bigots who are interested only in the children who attend such schools? Are not the benefactors humanitarians who are interested in all school children and who would be delighted to see the endowment transferred from a school that no longer exists to children in schools that exist in the education authority sector? If the Minister made an endowment to a school in Stirling, he would be horrified if that money were spent on children who attended a school under education authority control. However, the Minister is fairly unique in Scotland and the vast majority of people who make endowments would be delighted to see their money used for improving the provision of education in Scotland; be that in the education authority or self-governing sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some self-governing schools may be in the centre of cities, and part of the endowment may be property. On the school being wound up, the property could be immensely valuable and have massive development potential. If the wrong type of people got their hands on that property, they could make a fast buck out of demolishing it and building houses or offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the example of Balgowan list D school. The Minister will argue that the Secretary of State would not let such development happen, but the Secretary of State allowed it to happen. In 1983 he sat back and did nothing while the school board at Balgowan list D school demolished a four-year-old sports hall and sold the land to Barratt. If he allowed it to happen in 1983, what is there to stop him from allowing it to happen in 1993? When a self-governing school is discontinued, making valuable property available in the centre of a city, what will prevent the Secretary of State from transferring the property back to someone who may have some connection with the benefactor, who may make a killing from developing it? That will be allowed under the clause as long as the Minister takes what he describes as a principled position on behalf of those who wish to make a fast buck in the free enterprise society that the Minister is determined to see established in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that there is an analogy to be drawn with Hamilton college? It was under the Secretary of State's tutelage a few years ago, when there was a tremendous hue and cry about it. Could that not arise again? The Minister must be more forthcoming with detailed information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, but whereas the Tories who were around in Scotland at that time were embarrassed by Hamilton college, the Minister probably saw it as a great coup that should be repeated as often as possible on behalf of the entrepreneurs whom he represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's refusal to consider the amendments gives cause for concern, because there is potential for abuse. Endowments, grants and property that have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1203</span>
been earmarked for education provision could be diverted away to allow others to make quick and easy profits out of some other provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not assured by the answer that the Secretary of State for Scotland is there to protect the schools' interests because Hamilton College, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and Balgowan list D school were offered no form of protection by the Secretary of State in power at the time. The present Secretary of State for Scotland is much further to the Right than the previous one, although he is probably much further to the Left than the Minister and the next Secretary of State. We can, therefore, assume that nothing will be done when a self-governing school is wound up and the property handed back to the quick-buck merchants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) advises me to withdraw, so I shall change my mind at the last moment to show the Whips that, on occasion, I do as I am told.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister will tell us that the amendment is a mere technicality, but will he be so courteous as to let us know why he has moved an amendment to remove the word "discontinued" and insert "wound up"?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill was hastily drafted, it was because we were consulting. I thought that the view of Opposition Members was that the consultation process made no difference. They must make up their mind which criticism they wish to direct at the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a technical amendment, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) anticipated. It covers the point that in clause 44(1) a distinction is made between "discontinuance" of a self-governing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1204</span>
school, under clause 29, and the Secretary of State "ceasing to maintain" a school, under clause 31. Both of those situations amount to a "winding up" of the school, however, and as clause 46 is intended to apply to both situations, the term "wound up" is appropriate and "discontinued" is not. Amendment No. 232 accordingly provides the correct terminology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could be forgiven for thinking that we are being wound up. We have said repeatedly that we want the fullest consultation, which we do not feel has taken place, and we wanted the Government to take their time to draft the Bill properly. So it is not surprising that small errors have to be corrected. However, as the Minister has explained the point of the amendment, and as there is nothing to object to, we have no further comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier we referred to our concerns about this range of clauses. Clause 46, which is headed:
	<br><q><p>"Transfer of school for establishment of new school"</p></q>
genuinely fascinates us. Rather than stretch your tolerance in the debate on this amendment, Mr. Hogg, we shall come back to the substantive issues on clause stand part. Suffice it to say that amendments Nos. 304 and 305 relate to subsection (4), which deals with what is euphemistically called "the appropriate consideration".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose that in the transfer of a school for the establishment of a new school, the Secretary of State must consult the education authority about the land, identified in subsection (4)(a), and about the moveable property, identified in subsection (4)(b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions give rise to major concerns, because of their technical wording and the wider implications that we, from a cynical point of view, could draw from them. It is a feature of the Bill that the education authority will be grudgingly consulted on most matters. Indeed, if it had not been for Opposition amendments, many of which the Minister has accepted, there would be major weaknesses in the Bill, because not only is the education authority the host authority for self-governing schools, but it is the prime player in the provision of education, regardless of whether schools in the area opt out. We are using amendments Nos. 304 and 305 to emphasise that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without straying into a stand part debate, I should like to refer to subsection (4), which deals with the transfer amounts in respect of land and moveable property. Without the involvement of the education authority in such debates, a major opportunity could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1205</span>
be missed to bring a balance to the deliberations on the transfer of a school for the establishment of a new one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the possibility of establishing a new school out of the ashes of an old one. Unlike our other debates this afternoon, this is not merely about the winding up of self-governing schools and their absorption into the education authority or some other, as yet unknown, sector, such as the independent or voluntary sectors. Voluntary schools are the subject of a later clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to develop some of our major concerns further. However, I shall leave my comments so that the Minister can respond, once again, to the question of important consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you called me before the Minister, Mr. Hogg, because it may be easier for him to respond to the points that I wish to make on the amendments. Amendment No. 305 would provide that when the Secretary of State determines the market value of the land as at the dissolution date, he should do so after consultation with the local authority. The amendment is so obviously reasonable that there could not possibly be a political dispute about it. Different valuers may value land at different amounts, according to the part of the country. It would not do for someone sitting in New St. Andrews house to say that so many hectares of land equal so much in value. Valuers know about local land markets. A parcel of land might be of far more value in one local authority area than in another, as local conditions will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say in passing that expertise in valuing land and property will disappear under the poll tax legislation, as there will be increasingly less call for valuation when property is no longer valued for assessed rental? Nevertheless, we must keep those skills alive. Therefore, it seems only reasonable that when the Secretary of state is determining the land's market value, he should do so with the assistance of local knowledge. After all, the local authority owned the land in the first place. Should it not have a right to express its view on it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those considerations apply also to moveable property, which may be normal school equipment such as books. It is impossible to tell the condition and age of property and the use and abuse to which it has been subjected unless one has access to it. Again, someone sitting in New St. Andrews house is far too remote from that to give a fair valuation. Simply to get on with the business in hand, he might set the value at an unreasonably low level, knowing that it will be popular with those who will benefit. Any such decision will be unfair to the local authority. Those who pay the community charge for services have a right to expect a fair valuation of property that has been in their hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those obvious reasons, everything possible should be done to ensure that valuations are fair, both for the benefit of those who pay the community charge in the area and in fairness to those who will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1206</span>
receive the land or moveable property. We simply want fairness, not advantage to one side or the other. We can achieve that by accepting the amendment. I am sure that the Minister will find the amendment so reasonable that he will accept it in principle, even if he tells us that it is technically faulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I recognise the need for the Secretary of State to consult an education authority in appropriate circumstances, I do not consider that clause 46(4) presents an appropriate context for such consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 46(4) is concerned with the determination which would have to be made by the Secretary of State in respect of the market value of school land and moveable property, formally owned by the board of management of a wound-up self-governing school, where that land and moveable property is to transfer to the proposer of a new, independent school. The Secretary of State's determination of the market value of the school property is for the purposes of calculating the "appropriate consideration" which is to be paid, in accordance with clause 46, to the education authority. Clause 46 recognises the education authority's interest in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But clause 46(4) is a technical provision concerned with the valuation of the school land and moveable property concerned. In practice, the Secretary of State would seek the district valuer's impartial advice on the market value of the school. The Secretary of State's determination would be based on a professional assessment of all the land and other property. In making his determination the Secretary of State would have to act in a reasonable manner and would not be able to act arbitrarily by simply pulling figures out of the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation with the education authority, as such, would not be an appropriate basis upon which the Secretary of State could make a property valuation. Accordingly, amendments Nos. 305 and 304 are unacceptable and I ask that they be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, be leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it would be more appropriate to return to some of our concerns in the stand part debate. We may be swayed by argument and reason, but we believe that clause 46 is outrageous because it brings together the tangled threads that we discussed on other clauses. Under subsection (1), if a school is discontinued property and land can be transferred to any person known as "the proposer". Subsection (2) states:
	<br><q><p>"Where the land or moveable property is transferred as described in subsection (1)… the proposer shall pay the appropriate consideration to the education authority".</p></q>
To complete the drama, subsection (4)(a) defines "the appropriate consideration" for land as
	<br><q><p>"such an amount as the Secretary of State determines to be the market value of the land".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1207</span>
The market value is a well-known concept and I hope will be the subject of an independent valuation. But the Secretary of State has to determine the market value. Subsection (4)(b) refers to moveable property and I accept that that is a more difficult concept. It defines "the appropriate consideration" for moveable property as the amount that
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State determines to be a fair consideration for the transfer of that property."</p></q>
So we have a combination of consideration and apppropriateness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does subsection (1) mean? While there has been little regard for the notion of independent schooling in the previous 45 clauses, there has always been more than a hint of the Government's real agenda for a school which, through winding up and discontinuance, may return to the education authority sector. We are concerned that the hint of a hidden agenda becomes a reality in clause 46. That is not so Machiavellian that the Minister can merely dismiss it as normal Labour party thinking every time the phrase
	<br><q><p>"establishing a new independent school"</p></q>
looms on the horizon. We have a legitimate right to ask about the property and land of a new school that is being devised because the children and teachers will not be there. Perhaps they will be, and the Minister might tell us about that. We are talking about occupying the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a school closes, there may be a case for the property to be disposed of—as currently happens throughout Scotland—and the price that is realised to be reinvested. That might have no impact on the quality of education in an area. We are discussing a school that has gone through the process of achieving self-governing status and has then, been discontinued so that its premises are technically up for grabs, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two questions ensue from that. First, what encouragement will be given as part of that process to people who are interested in the school and who wish, under subsection (1), to become "the proposer"? That begs a second question, about the financial transaction that could result from a person, "a proposer" or an interested party coming forward to establish the new school. It is from this that suspicions are aroused by subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wishes the Bill to be about not only self-governing schools but voluntary and independent schools, and self-governing schools moving towards independent status, why on earth is this not apparent in the Bill instead of being hidden away in a range of clauses that culminate forcefully in clause 46? Clause 46 makes us think that all the sweetness and light that the Minister has attached to this part of the Bill may not be what it seems to be. We are concerned that it is yet another attempt to undermine the quality of education authority provision by looking much further ahead than the self-governing concept, to provide for a school to close down in that form and emerge as a different type of school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to the children if the school discontinues and there is a winding-up order? Will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1208</span>
provision be made for the children? Will the Minister be able to distinguish between a shell of a building and land being given over to the proposer and the concept of land property and teachers and children being passed over, although that is not in clause 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause raises many issues, and my hon. Friends share my anxieties. I simply make a plea. We are on record as saying that this is a thoroughly dishonest Bill. It is both educationally divisive and politically dishonest. If the Government were keen to pursue these avenues, it would make more sense if they laid up front in the Bill what was actually being considered. I suspect that the Minister will assure us that there is nothing untoward in the clause and that it is a figment of some Socialist cynicism that we conjure up to attack the Government. That is not good enough. There are worries, and apart from the definitional aspects of the points that I have raised, we want some other assurances. First, we want to know that it is not a backdoor method of creating a form of independent school that takes advantage of—indeed, exploits—a school that is discontinued. Secondly, we want to know about the even-handedness of the financial aspects of the clause, especially subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is aimed at ensuring that the education authority was consulted was not accepted, as was the Minister's Derogative. However, it would have provided a safeguard so that, in the arbitration on these resources, a party that had a wider interst than either the Government or "the proposer" as described in subsection (1) would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we seek assurances about the wider educational implications of a new school emerging under clause 46(1). We are talking not just about land and buildings but about a wider concept of educational provision. If a person wishes to establish a new independent school, that is obviously another step removed from self-governing status and should have been the subject of further consultation. Is the Bill about self-governing status or about promoting independent schooling by a variety of means? We need assurances on this. The Minister must not be allowed to continue with this promotion of self-governing schools when the wider implications have not been thought through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all the matters that we have raised are merely suspicions that the Government can dismiss or cynically ignore because they are politically motivated, will the Minister at least address himself to the important concern that I shall raise as we get to the end of part I? We have stressed the need for consultation, but there has been no consultation. There has been some consultation on part of part III, which we shall come to soon. There has been some discussions on part II, which concerns further education, because of a paper that was published in 1986. What gives the Government the mandate to bring before the Committee part I of a Bill that has never been the subject of any genuine consultation, and has never figured in a political manifesto? Between the lines, one can now see a much wider attack and a wider promotion of independent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1209</span>
education than was apparent at the start of our deliberations. The Minister must try to allay some of our fears about the long-term implications of accepting the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's suspicions are entirely correct. The clause is about allowing groups to come in after those who have been running the school as an opted-out school have got tired of it, and to take over on the cheap. In reply to my earlier probing on two other amendments, the Minister said that the district valuer would decide the market value of the land. I noticed that he said nothing about the moveable property valuation. His reply sounded very reasonable but if he wished to reassure us about the complete fairness of the system, he should have allowed a valuer chosen by the local authority to value the land. The local authority would be standing at some distance, but would at least be inclined to choose someone who would give a true value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may sound unduly suspicious, but we are living in a country where a Tory-controlled local authority, not a million miles from here, sold a cemetery for £1 to some get-rich-quick business men. Having taken an enormous amount of stick for that, it has now learnt its lesson. Now if a Tory-controlled local authority wanted to sell off some of its cemeteries to its pals in the private sector it would do so in two stages, just as is happening with schools. It would invite a group of lair owners to form a consortium to run the cemetery and would later sell it off for some trifle to a third party that wanted to use the land for another purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One realises how dangerous the Bill is. The school could opt out of education authority control, and go beyond the consideration of local parents' needs and straight into the hands of those who see a scheme for making money in a private sector operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking of land that often can be very valuable. Some schools have large playing fields surrounding the school buildings, sometimes involving several acres of land, at high prices. We are talking not of trifles, but of a considerable amount of money that some people stand to gain unless we can ensure that the land is valued fairly. The cemetery was not an isolated incident. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) mentioned selling Hamilton college, which was another financial scandal. Also, a hospital sold some acres of land at a scandalously low price. Always we are told that that is done on an apparently fair valuation. However, in such cases the valuer has been relied upon to give the lowest possible valuation, while retaining his professional credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has happened in such cases. Heaven knows what happened in the case of Westminster cemetery, because not even a lunatic could call a cemetery worth only £1. That has been happening—it is not a figment of our imagination. Such events have happened in the real world. The Opposition are trying to safeguard people against that. We must be sure that land is valued properly for the purpose of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not trouble to tell us how we could be assured about the valuation of moveable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1210</span>
property. People in the profession of valuation and running auctions abound in Scotland today. As 10 per cent, of people—and 20 per cent, in constituencies such as mine—are unemployed, many people have to put their household items into pawn, so the business of valuation, auctioneering and pawn shopkeeping is thriving. There is no lack of expertise in that direction. Therefore, it should be easy to find a genuinely independent valuer of school property who would come to a fair decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not be satisfied unless the Minister can show how things will be gloriously different from the past, when there were the appallingly low valuations of which I have spoken. Scottish people want to be reassured about that because it was a scandal to which many people responded vigorously. I am sure that the Minister must have received many letters in the past. If he does not want to be snowed under with similar indignant letters in future, he must take on board our point and ensure that there will be no such financial scandals about the handling of school property, whether moveable items or land. I suspect that he hopes that people will have forgotten all about it when those events happen. He might even be in a different job by then and hope to have washed his hands of the affair. But let us assume that he has a since of responsibility and hear what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said that the Minister might not be too worried about potential scandals because he might have moved on by the time that any scandal became public knowledge and might be in a different job. Conservative Ministers have to face up to scandals many years after they take place. A famous film is now showing in Leicester square about a scandal involving Tory Ministers. It deals not with selling property belonging to a self-governing school, but with a far more interesting subject. The potential for future scandal is present in the Bill. The Minister must reply to that. He has developed a habit of not responding to any points raised in clause stand part debate and just sits on his hands and smiles weakly when it is his turn to participate in the debate. I hope that he will answer some of the serious misgivings raised by the Opposition. For example, this evening I have already mentioned several ways in which education authorities are discriminated against, but the Minister has yet to respond in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the transfer of land or moveable property to the person who intends to set up a new independent school, the value of the property has to be paid for by the proposer, but less the repayment of any capital grants, which go back to the Secretary of State for Scotland. When making capital allocations between a self-governing school and an education authority, the Secretary of Scotland decides that what goes to the self-governing school cannot go to the education authority. However, when a school is wound up, the money that would have gone to the education authority if the self-governing school had not been set up is mysteriously not handed back to the education authority. Instead, it goes to the Secretary of State, who may or may not allocate that expenditure for education. That seems unfair. If money is allocated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1211</span>
for expenditure on education and a school is wound up, the money should still be spent on education. The only sensible way to do that is to ensure that it is allocated to the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the appropriate consideration to be paid by the proposer to the education authority is calculated, he first has to pay any liabilities that the board of management has incurred. Among those liabilities are listed redundancy payments to staff who are no longer required. It is mysterious that if someone is trying to save a school, albeit by keeping it in the independent sector, he or she will have no use for the staff employed at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is building into the clause the opportunity for the proposer to pay off all the staff and bring in a new set of staff to the independent school being established. That is worrying because it gives a free hand to the proposer. It appears to prove that the type of independent school that may take the place of the self-governing school is a very different beast from either self-governing or education authority schools. I suspect that the Minister has intended all along that a new type of school should emerge and that the proposer should be given the maximum freedom to establish it along new lines and to employ new staff to meet the new purposes, whatever they may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What should the appropriate consideration be? Many of my hon. Friends have already touched on that. The Minister said that it was the market value of the land and buildings as determined by the Secretary of State for Scotland and that the Secretary of State would not pull a figure out of the air. The Minister has more confidence than the Opposition, because there have been proven examples of where whatever figure the Secretary of State has arrived at was not appropriate. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton referred to the example of Hamilton college and I referred to the sports hall of Balgowan list D school. A more recent example is the royal ordnance factories that have been privatised and whose land was sold at well below its potential market value. I assume that the Minister involved in that decision followed set procedures, which would also apply to the Secretary of State for Scotland in respect of a self-governing school. There is no guarantee that the Secretary of State will arrive at an appropriate market value. He could arrive at a figure that grossly undervalues the market value of the land and property involved. In determining that value, there is potential for massive abuse. He also added that the Secretary of State will determine what is described as a fair consideration for the furnishings and equipment in the school. I recall this morning's debate when the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) desparately sought an example of a self-governing school incurring expenditure. He cited the example of an education authority removing computers from a self-governing school, which then had to pay to replace them. The Minister nodded appreciatively in agreement with the hon. Member for Tayside, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, the school would have purchased the computers with a recurrent grant from the Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1212</span>
of State for Scotland, yet he will decide how much should be paid for them in order to allow the school to wind up and take independent status. That is unfair. The recurrent grant, which would otherwise have gone to the education authority, was used to buy computers and the Secretary of State will then decide a fair price for them. The computers will not necessarily return to the education authority. They could go to the Secretary of State for Scotland, so the education authority might significantly lose out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued because the notes on clause 46 state:
	<br><q><p>"Independent school here includes a technology academy established under 	<i>clause 62</i> of the Bill."</p></q>
The proposer might be someone wishing to set up a technology academy, which we shall consider later in the Bill. However, in the case of a technology academy, I understand that the Secretary of State for Scotland will reach an agreement with the person wishing to establish one. If that person agrees to provide secondary education, a broad curriculum with an emphasis on science and technology and agrees not to charge fees, the Secretary of State will make capital and recurrent grant payments to that person. The individual could use that capital payment to buy land and buildings formerly belonging to a self-governing school. The cost of that land and building will be determined by the Secretary of State for Scotland. That is a circular and strange route. It is not the operation of the free market. The Secretary of State will decide the value of the land and the moveable property, he will tell the purchaser how much they will cost and then he will make payments to that person to allow him to buy them. That is a strange provision for a free marketeer such as the Minister to put into the Bill, but that is what the clause contains. I am intrigued to discover what the justification for that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any justification for the Secretary of State deciding how much money should be paid and then allocating that money to an individual to allow him to buy it. Where is the common sense in that? There is none, and the Minister should consider the provisions of clause 46 and how they relate to clause 62. Individuals will seek both a capital allocation from the Secretary of State and some sign of the price of the land and moveable property that they will use that allocation to buy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points made by my hon. Friends illustrate that the i's have not been dotted and the i's have not been crossed in the clause. We referred to Hamilton college and royal ordnance factories. The Secretary of State will be empowered to be the arbiter. If things go wrong, there will be no official body to monitor what has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 46(1) says:
	<br><q><p> "Subject to the provisions of this section, where for the purpose of establishing a new independent school, any person ('the proposer') proposes to occupy the premises of a school"</p></q>
the secretary of state can transfer land to that person. Under clause 29, if a board of management wishes to discontinue a school, it can pass resolutions at two separate meetings and publish proposals. That can be done without consultation with the parents. Only the approval of the Secretary of State is necessary.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1213</span>
The education authority has the opportunity to say whether it is prepared to operate a school in place of the self-governing school, but the main decision would be taken when the board of management decided to discontinue. The mechanism of discrimination is such that members of the board of management could decide to discontinue, but also may be urged to do so by others. Therefore, a small select group can decide to discontinue. The parents will have no opportunity to voice their opinion, but the school could change its character completely, for example, to a technology academy, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said and the conditions of service for the staff could change drastically on the decision of one or two people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about accountability to the community and to the poll tax payers. The Secretary of State will take money away from education authorities and give it to the self-governing schools in the form of capital grants, but when a school has been discontinued, that money will not find its way back to the education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we prevent another Hamilton college or royal ordnance factory? We should take the lessons of local government, where the Audit Commission operates. External auditors examine and comment on how an education authority spends its money. Should there not be an external auditor for when a school decides to discontinue? That would be the only way to prevent abuses of the system such as the sale of Hamilton college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister takes this matter seriously, he should spell out how the Secretary of State and the college can both be held accountable for the actions that they take. If it is good enough for councillors and local authorities to be surcharged, it should be good enough for the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill cuts away at democracy. Clause 46 allows a person, perhaps in conjunction with one or two others, to make a decision with the Secretary of State. But they must be made accountable. The Minister should deal with the financial problems and allay our fears about possible abuses, because they were not allayed when Hamilton college was sold. The figure £800,000 was mentioned when it was sold, but the land was valued at £6 million. What a terrible abuse of the system. There was no way that those people could be held accountable. The Minister has an obligation to tell us how he envisages individuals and groups being held accountable for public money and its disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not fully conversant with the details of the disposal of Hamilton college. However, I seem to recall that the issue was about the use of the facility and how it was valued according to that use. It was valued as an educational establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already provides the accountability for which the hon. Gentleman has argued. The Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament. The Public Accounts Committee does an extremely effective job in holding Ministers and Departments to account for their transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1214</span>
Whenever I try to be helpful to the Committee, Opposition Members see hidden in clauses agendas that are simply not there. The clause simply provides for the Secretary of State to dispose of property to an independent school or a local authority. He cannot sell it for any purpose other than educational. The local authority can then sell it for any purpose?consistent with planning approval. In ensuring that there is an opportunity for the facility to be used for a continuing educational purpose, the Secretary of State is acting properly. Surely Opposition Members should welcome the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The public Accounts Committee has no power to surcharge or to impose its view on the Secretary of State. Less than a year ago, the Public Accounts Committee issued a report on a fraud at a Ministry of Defence depot of £440,000 involving 60 or 70 civil servants. The Public Accounts Committee could not even get the Ministry of Defence to charge those individuals for fraud. All it could do was simply take a condemnatory stance, as it has no teeth whatsoever. My proposition, which would give powers of surcharge, differs from the Minister's example of the Public Accounts Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct about powers of surcharge, but I doubt whether Sir Alex Fletcher would share his views on Parliament's lack of teeth in holding Ministers to account for decisions for which they must carry responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) provides for a winding-up order made by the Secretary of State under clause 44 to transfer the property of a self-governing school to a person proposing to set up a new independent school. The provisions of clause 45, relating to the disposal of property, apply to such a transfer with the proposal of a new independent school in place of the education authority as recipient of the property. The amendments of relevant definitions in paragraph 8(18) of schedule 10 to the Bill ensure that the definition of "independent school" under the 1980 Act will include a technology academy established under clause 62.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So a school that is being wound up has an opportunity to become a technology academy. There is nothing sinister in the ability of an independent school to take over the property of a self-governing school that is closing. Where there is a proposal to set up such a school, the property of the self-governing school should pass to the person proposing to set it up rather than to the education authority. Education authorities are fairly compensated by the provisions for the person setting up the independent school to pay an amount in respect of the value of that property to them. Therefore, they will be in a position broadly similar to that in which they would have found themselves, had the property of the self-governing school reverted directly to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is reasonable, as it protects educational interests and ensures that property is directed to educational use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the Minister that the education authority will necessarily be fairly

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1215</span>
compensated for any land, buildings or property which will go to a new independent school, such as the technology academy. The technology academy will be able to buy the land, buildings, moveable property and educational equipment at a price fixed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. He will not fix that price at a level that fairly compensates the education authority, but at a level at which he is prepared to fund the person setting up a technology academy through a capital grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loser will be the education authority which will lose the land, buildings, moveable property and educational equipment to the technology academy and will not get a fair price for them. There is no guarantee that the Secretary of State for Scotland will fix a fair market price. We have given example after example where previous Secretaries of State for Scotland have not fixed fair market prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an education authority thought that it had been done by the Secretary of State— perish the thought—and had not got a fair price, it could challenge the valuation through the courts. The clause clearly states the position. The hon. Gentleman is not right in assuming that the compensation established by the Secretary of State will be unfair, or, if it is held to be unfair, that the education authority cannot seek redress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In theory, there is always recourse to the courts. However, the Minister knows that such recourse is undertaken only when people are certain of getting the result that they want and can wait two or three years for a final decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts system is one of the greatest supporters of the country's establishment. A proper judicial system would have a different court system from the existing one, which is run in the main by supporters of the Conservative party. I am not criticising members of the judiciary for being supporters of the Conservative party; I am simply remarking on the fact. They are unlikely to find in favour of people who are rowing with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.

The Secretary of State for Scotland will allocate him a capital grant with which he can purchase the self-governing school.

	<div class='title'>DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS MONEY ON WINDING-UP</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2)(b) again refers to
	<br><q><p>"transferred, to an education authority or to some other person."</p></q>
That phrase creates in our minds suspicions about the intermediary between the Secretary of State and the education authority. The Minister should give us a brief insight into the investment referred to in subsection (4) and the relationship with the Financial Services Act 1986. We are concerned about public accountability on financial matters. After the winding up of a self-governing school surplus money will be disposed of to the Secretary of State. The clause is essentially technical, but it raises questions about that disposal of surplus money and the safeguards under the Financial Services Act 1986 and in relation to an investment and the duties of the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 47 brings to a conclusion the first part of the Bill. We have dealt at length with finance and disposals, and in clause 46 we touched upon a cynical way to promote independent education at the expense initially of education authority schools and ultimately of self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would welcome brief comments from the Minister about the implications of clause 47 and the reference to "some other person". We shall not vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether to be grateful for that invitation. Subsection (4) merely details the type of investments covered that would be transferred to the Secretary of State. Subsection (3) allows funds to be transferred to an education authority or others free of any existing trust under which they were held by the board. Under subsection (2) the Secretary of State has the power to specify
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1217</span>
new trust purposes. Subsection (5) details the types of investment covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is necessary because provision must be made for surplus funds held by a board of management when a self-governing school is wound up. It gives the Secretary of State wide discretion because a wide variety of circumstances may arise on a wind-up. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is a technical clause and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the ministerial assurances. Will the Minister briefly clarify the distinction in subsection (1) between "paid" and "transferred"? I genuinely do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is coming to me. As everyone knew, apart from me, sums are "paid" and investments are "transferred". That is the terminology used for different types of money. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
