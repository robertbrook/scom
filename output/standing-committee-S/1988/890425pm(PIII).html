	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[continuation from col. 962]</p>
	<p>12.15 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is vital to oppose amendment No. 139 because it would prevent a self-governing school from changing its characteristics for five years. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) gave the game away. He said that he felt that it would be wrong for a school to change its character, particularly from the perspective of Moslem schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to Conservative Members coming to life at this time of night because of the full moon. I pricked up my ears because he had let the cat out of the bag about his attitude towards Moslems in Scotland. I believe that he was motivated to speak so enthusiastically to the amendment by the EIS, which said of the proposals to enable schools to change their characteristics:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Members"—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
of the Committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will have noted statements by leaders of the Muslim community in Glasgow that would envisage using the opting-out procedure to obtain Muslim schools within the state sector. Their device would be to go for opting-out schools with a Muslim majority and then use Clause 28 to make the school an Islamic school. It is hard to imagine a course of action which would be so prejudicial to race-relations."</p></blockquote>
I understand the Opposition's game in tabling the amendment. They wish to prevent Moslems, who have publicly acknowledged the benefits that will accrue to them by using clause 28, from taking full advantage of the opportunities for a self-governing school to change its characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the people attacked by the EIS are, in large measure, some of my own constituents, notably Dr. Ghulam Nabi of the mosque who is interested in proceeding towards self-governing status?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend also agree that there is no question of responsible members of the Islamic community using the Bill to set up purely Islamic schools? They want to exercise parental choice so that the fact that a school has a substantial Moslem population simply reflects the school's approach and does not mean that it excludes pupils from other communities whose parents want their children to benefit from that type of more traditional education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>964</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely correct and speaks from personal experience. His constituency has a substantial Moslem community which is looking to the Bill to give it the very opportunities that he has outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just before the Division, the hon. Member for Dundee, East said that he wanted the amendment specifically to deny Moslems in my hon. Friend's constituency from taking advantage of the Bill. They have already said that they wish to do so, and as spokesman for the EIS, the hon. Gentleman has said that he does not want them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask the hon. Member for Dundee, East and, presumably, the Opposition Front Bench, a question. There is a difference of view which the hon. Member for Dundee, East more or less conceded in reply to an intervention. It is plain that the Opposition do not want Moslems in Scotland to have the same rights that the deputy leader of the Labour party is prepared to give Moslems in England. Opposition Members say that Scotland is different and that the deputy leader of the Labour party has no right to speak on Scottish education matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have a right and a duty to speak for Moslems north and south of the border and to ensure that they have the same rights and opportunities that the deputy leader of the Labour party, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), wants to give Moslems in England. It is a travesty and disgrace that Opposition Members are not prepared to allow Moslems in Scotland the freedoms that their Front-Bench spokesman for England wants for Moslems in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 2 April, the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook said during the BBC television programme "On the Record":
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sympathetic to Muslim voluntary aided schools within the State system, where rules of the state system—in terms of curriculum, the standards, the qualifications of teachers, and the buildings—are observed, but where there is the opportunity for religious education to be geared to the faith and the beliefs of the children of the parents. As long as we carry on doing that for the Catholics, for the Anglicans, for the Jews, and to a slight extent for the non-conformists, it is indefensible that we should not do it for the Muslims.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In the Labour party"—</p></blockquote>
I presume that when the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook uses the term "Labour party" he does not add in brackets, "but not the Scottish Labour party." Surely he at least can claim to speak for the whole of the Labour party, north and south of the border. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a unanimous view"—</p></blockquote>
I presume that unanimity means the same in Scotland as it does in England—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the Moslem British—</p></blockquote>
not the Moslem English or the Moslem Scottish—
	<br><blockquote><p>"must be treated as free and equal citizens."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that we will hear the Labour conference saying, "Let's treat them as second-class citizens," but Opposition Members in Committee treat Moslems in Scotland as second-class citizens. We had it from the hon. Member for Dundee, East a few moments before the Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>965</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Does he agree that the implication of the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is that there is only one set of people in Scotland who must be treated favourably and differentially—the Irish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Oh."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the terms and sentiment of the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East led me to that sad conclusion. The words that will appear on the record will hang round the necks of Opposition Members. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> They laugh. They claim that their party speaks for all races and for equality of opportunity for everyone, but they would deny—in fairness, the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook, the deputy leader of the Labour party would not—Moslems in Scotland the right to be first-class citizens. They would not be prepared to enable the characteristics of a school to be changed in Scotland to grant Moslems the same rights as the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook stated on 2 April on the programme "On the Record".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman disagree with the provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 which require religious education in schools to be of a principally Christian character? If he defends the rights of Moslem schools, does he justify that requirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that a particular religion, be it Christian, Moslem or whatever, should properly be taught when it is clear that a substantial group of people have a natural affinity towards it. I hope that we can proceed with an Education Reform Act (Amendment) Bill in successive sessions to build upon the foundations established by the 1988 Act. The Labour party tonight has done a grave disservice to Moslems—.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I make exactly the same point as that I made to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion): we are debating amendment No. 139 which is narrow in its scope. It is not about denominational schools and the hon. Member should bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Martin. I am grateful for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 is important to Moslems in Scotland because, if we pass the amendment, we will deny them, for five years, the opportunity to change the characteristics of the schools in which they predominate. We will deny them the opportunity to attain the goals set for them by the deputy leader of the Labour party. The Committee has revealed to the Moslem community in Scotland the real attitudes of Opposition Members and their harsh words will appear on the record. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood will draw those views to the attention of the Moslem communities in his own constituency and elsewhere as soon as possible. The speech by the hon. Member for Dundee, East was extremely revealing, if not disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>966</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will continue to debate this clause and will tell me what it means— not what the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes thinks it means. If he can stop frothing at the mouth and listen for a little while we might get somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause a simple majority of those with the right to vote—a majority of one—could have the power to change the character of a school substantially in a number of different ways. One way has already been highlighted in our debates but there are many other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Minister said that he did not think it appropriate for a self-governing school to change its character in any fundamental sense in "the first few years" of its self government. If the Minister considers that inappropriate, we are only arguing about the length of time after which it should be allowed to change its character substantially. We are not discussing whether, but when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to bear in mind that a simple majority of one could achieve the major change. Conservative Members are presenting this as a fine democratic principle. If they really believed in governing this country in a democratic fashion they would have conceded much to Scotland long before this. In Scotland there are not majorities of one, but vast majorities, against their policies to which they pay no heed. Let us not hear any nonsense about fine democratic principles and about how it is acceptable to make a substantial change in the running of a school on the basis of a majority of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, Mr. Martin, that you do not want us to discuss the merits of any system of running a school but it is important to consider the sort of changes that could be made and how divisive they could be. For example, some parents with children at a school which educates both sexes could advocate that it should become a single-sex school. That would be a controversial issue among parents. Some might consider it a splendid idea and others could be much against it. Both sides could argue their case on education grounds. If the side which wanted to change the school into a single-sex school won the debate, the children of the other sex would be forced to go elsewhere. We have already said that that would not merely inconvenience them slightly; they could have many miles to go to find an alternative school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady in favour of the official policy of the ruling group in Strathclyde to end single-sex schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely irrelevant whether I approve of that policy. As it happens I do not believe in single-sex schools. I think that the education of both boys and girls benefits from their being at school together. But my opinion is beside the point. If a majority in a school wanted to change it to a single-sex school it would create enormous inconvenience for the sex disadvantaged by that decision. That is the point I am driving at. The division in the community would not be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>967</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe in single-sex schools. Is that clear enough?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that the hon. Member for Eastwood fails to grasp is that my point of view does not matter a toss when it comes to an individual school. I shall not have a vote as my two children are well past school age. What matters is that if a majority succeeded in changing a school to a single-sex school of whichever sex, the children of the other sex would be put to great inconvenience and would have to go elsewhere for their education. In some cases in Scotland that could mean travelling several miles to the other school. That cannot be ignored. That is the type of substantial change that could happen, and is something that most sensible parents would wish to avoid. The drafters of this legislation blandly accept that it is a possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I rephrase the question? I accept the point that the hon. Lady has made. Does she agree with the policy of Strathclyde regional council to end single-sex schools in Strathclyde?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is under a misapprehension about Strathclyde regional council's poilicy in any event. Once again, I do not believe in single-sex schools. I would advocate any opportunity to end single-sex schools in a way that did not disadvantage the current pupils at such a school. I would not want to create problems for them. I would want to try to end single-sex education in a way that did not disrupt the education of current pupils. I am talking not only about Strathclyde; I would end Eton and other single-sex public schools too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And, I take it, Our Lady and St. Francis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how clear I have to make it. I mean all single-sex schools. Is that clear enough? That is my own opinion. No matter where they are, or which they are, or which religion or which sex they are, I would end them. I do not believe in single-sex schools. Got it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. I do not question the hon. Lady's personal beliefs, but does she agree with Strathclyde imposing its beliefs on parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not mind an odd reference to schools, but I plead with hon. Members to remember that we are discussing amendment No. 139.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not have made it clear enough for the hon. Member for Eastwood, but I think that all other hon. Members understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a substantial change in the majority denomination of parents of children at a school. A school could change from non-denominational to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>968</span>
particular denomination, or from a majority for one denomination to another. Great play has been made of problems faced by Moslem parents in Scotland. The contribution of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes was a disgrace. If he and his hon. Friends were the least bit concerned about the rights of Moslems in Britain, Moslems would not face so many problems. Every week in my surgery I see a constituent with a Moslem background. Perhaps his or her family is not being allowed to enter the country, even in the most dreadful and sad circumstances. For example, the father of a three-month-old baby awaiting a serious operation was not allowed to enter this country from Pakistan, despite a great deal of pleading from the Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is only one example of the problems that Moslems in this country have to face. I could cite numerous other cases if you allowed me to do so, Mr. Martin. If Conservative Members want chapter and verse, I can give them plenty from my weekly surgery notebook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that it is particularly disgraceful that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes claimed that he stood for the Moslems being free and equal citizens when he supports laws that discriminate against them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Lady answered that, we certainly should be stretching a point. We must return to amendment No. 139.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that I wish to make, but I shall move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members were concerned about the rights of Moslems in Scotland, they might pay some attention to their problems. Representatives of the Moslem community in Glasgow are worried about the food provided at schools. Not all education authorities provide halal meat in their schools. That is a serious issue for Moslems and they are right to press the point. It is wrong for any education authority to deny Moslem children the food that is acceptable to them. Similarly, they cannot always carry out their religious observance—for example, fasting at Ramadan. Schools should be sensitive to such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A clash of cultures raises difficulties for the education of girls. It does not help to ignore such problems; we should discuss them sensibly with Moslem community leaders. Moslem girls are often sent to Catholic single-sex schools because parents feel strongly that an all-girl education is appropriate for their daughters. That view is understandable, given their beliefs on the upbringing of girls. On the other hand, I know young Moslem women who have attended mixed secondary schools in Glasgow who feel that they have personally benefitted and would not send any children they might have to a single-sex school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any new community wants to preserve its own culture while becoming more involved in the culture of the host community. I use that ghastly sociological language because I cannot think of another way to express it. People's attitudes will change over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>969</span>
generations. I am of Irish descent but my attitude is not the same as my grandparents'. Likewise, I do not expect third-generation people of Pakistani stock to have the same attitude as their grandparents had. There are many questions about upbringing of Moslem girls that should be discussed seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is not treating the matter seriously. I believe that he wants to make cheap comments, but I shall take him on trust and see whether he has anything serious to say about the education of Moslem girls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will know that I have 2,500 Islamic constituents. The hon. Lady has presented the questions fairly, but what is her position on those questions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps at another time or in another place the hon. Gentleman can ask those questions. We must return to amendment No. 139.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go against your ruling, Mr. Martin, but may I finish my argument by saying that we should recognise that the Moslem community has complaints that should be dealt with. The way to resolve the problems is not through the Bill, which would allow a majority of one in a school to bring about a change and be divisive in a community. Moslems in my constituency would not want that; they do not want to create needless dispute and controversy with their neighbours, with whom they get on well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier the hon. Gentleman did not give way to me, but I shall be generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says the Moslems in her area would not wish to take advantage of the proposals in the Bill. Presumably, that is why amendment No. 139 was tabled. But the EIS quotation that I read to the Committee shows clearly that the Moslem community has already said that Moslems look to clause 28 to enable them to take advantage of the opportunities that it presents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not negate my point. Because of Moslems' understandable exasperation at the lack of progress on some issues that worry them— sometimes for decades—they are now saying, "Right.

Of course, they want their rights, and I shall stand up for them, too, but the
	<span class='label label-info column'>970</span>
matter should be approached in a way that will consider their sensitivities and their needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have named Moslems who support my argument and who have been quoted in the press. Will the hon. Lady name Moslems who support her argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was saying that. [Hon. Members: "He was."] I do not think that he said that. However, I know for sure that no one is dealing with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move on to another aspect of the substantial changes that could be made. Earlier, some hon. Members spoke of their wish to promote the education of the gifted and the talented, and said that they wished to look after the needs of an elite of pupils. That is another change that could occur as the result of a ballot decided by a majority of one. I shall not try your patience, Mr. Martin, by considering the merits of that argument again, but clearly it would be a controversial decision and could create ill feeling within the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned the fact that some halfwit, whose name I have forgotten, suggested that schools could be run without trained teachers. That would be a remarkable change, and one would have thought that such an idea was an invention or fiction. However, at a meeting, someone seriously proposed that because of a reluctance to pay proper wages for the training of teachers and not because of an ideological objection to teacher training. Those members of the Committee who are old enough will recall that untrained teachers used to work in the schools in Scotland. They came straight from school having gained a few Highers, but not enough to enter teacher training college. They could find a job in schools because there was a shortage of teachers and schools were forced to employ them. Therefore, we are talking about returning to the days of untrained teachers, not ill-trained, and the levels of achievement linked to that. The Minister poured scorn on an improvement in achievement of half an O-grade at some comprehensive schools. It has since been argued, however, that as the previous level of achievement was fewer than two O-levels, half an O-grade is a substantial improvement. Therefore, to consider returning to schools where few or none of the teachers were trained is so absurd as not to be worth further comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In voting for substantial change, especially to a more elitist form of education, parents should realise that they will be the dupes of people such as Stuart Sexton, a former adviser to Sir Keith Joseph and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>971</span>
now director of the Institute of Economic Affairs. In a pamphlet entitled "Our Schools: A Radical Policy" Mr. Sexton says that privatisation and the introduction of credit vouchers cannot be achieved quickly because
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would not be possible or desirable to make a sudden change".</p></blockquote>
He goes on to describe how that could be achieved by stealth. An unwary public could find that education authorities do not just play an advisory role in the conduct of schools, but do not exist at all. That outlook is anathema to the Scottish people. That is not the type of education that we wish to have. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes said that that would not happen unless the majority voted for it, but we know better than that in Scotland. We continue to get things that the majority voted against. The Scottish electorate should be aware that if the Bill is enacted, it will be a step toward the achievement of ultra-Right objectives that that faction dares not publicise. They have appeared only in a few articles in specialist journals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the future might hold if the Government are in power in five years time. Fortunately, we can look forward to the day when that will not be the position. The Water Bill is strongly opposed. The effects of this Bill and those that will occur when the poll tax hits England will further waken people and the Government will be defeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like he is Irish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. I am glad to hear my hon. Friend say that. We discovered that the hon. Member

for Dundee, East is an Irishman, he wears a tartan tie and, in between haranguing us and telling us that Scotland is culturally a different nation, he dives down the Corridor to Room 9 and votes on English legislation, the Local Government and Housing Bill, without even the courtesy of listening to the arguments. He then returns to this Committee and rants on some more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's habit of ranting and denunciation reached its high point this evening just before we adjourned for a very much appreciated break of half an hour at midnight. It is interesting to note that, although the hon. Gentleman spoke for the better part of an hour, he did not deal with amendment No. 139 and its effect on clause 28. His speech was, from beginning to end, rant. It was stuffed full of references to Right-wing fanatics on the Conservative Benches. I looked around and saw only the mild-mannered and kindly souls with whom I have a cup of coffee in the Tea Room from time to time. The hon. Gentleman regards us well-disposed, kindly, intelligent and carefully selected members of the Committee—as Right-wing fanatics. He refers to one mad ideology. He talked about this weird group that met in the Grosvenor House hotel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) is involved in any of the activities of the far Right, unlike some of his hon. Friends. He can sleep easy tonight.

The hon. Member for Eastwood is in a different category. He should also be exempt from some of the excesses that we have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is disingenuous if he thinks that he can split us. We stand as one, united. What my hon. Friends say, I say. What I say, they say—I hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that instead of talking in support of amendment No. 139, the hon. Member for Dundee, East was full of talk about mad ideology and the weird group that met in the Grosvenor House hotel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Ipswich that few members of the Committee have spoken to amendment No. 139. Perhaps he can break the habits of a lifetime and do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not challenge your ruling, Mr. Martin, but I am the first member of the Committee—with the possible exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown)—who has referred to amendment No. 139. The paucity of the Opposition's argument was hidden by a shroud of ranting. It went beyond talking about the weird group that met at the Grosvenor House hotel. There was talk of the full moon outside and fangs beginning to appear. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes was perhaps unwise to say that his ears pricked up. The speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East was a charade and a rant, nothing more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have not yet spoken to amendment No. 139. They have not told us why
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
there should be a delay regarding the right of parents to ballot, as the amendment would impose. The Opposition have simply attacked, in general terms, the stance of Conservative Members. It shows the fundamental weakness of their position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I distinctly recall saying at the start of my speech that the Secretary of State had admitted that the schools should not change their character in any fundamental sense in the first few years, so we were debating only the timing, not the substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just possible that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) devoted one sentence to the amendment at the beginning of her speech. But she, too, started ranting pretty soon, although at a slightly lower decibel level and in slightly less extreme terms than the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The hon. Lady threatened that she would end Eton. That shows the character of the Opposition to the clause and the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all manner of safeguards in clause 28 against the irresponsible use, by parents and boards of management, of the powers to change the characteristics of a self-governing school. First, a resolution must be passed by the board of management. Then there must be a ballot of parents, followed by publication of the proposals, which must be submited to the Secretary of State. At that point, there is an opportunity for any person to submit representations against those proposals to the Secretary of State. Finally, the approval of the Secretary of State must be given.Therefore the clause already provides safeguards against the unwise use of the provisions to allow a change in a school's characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that any further restrictions or safeguards are needed. The amendment would simply delay putting the provisions into practice. It would delay parents choosing, where such a choice was justified and was guarded by the restraints in the clause. The amendment would prevent parents from making a choice about changing the characteristics of self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, the bankruptcy of Opposition argument is shown up—it is all ranting. No one rants more effectively, but less persuasively, than the hon. Member for Dundee, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall use that in my election manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 139. I shall certainly not follow the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) in handing out compliments to his hon. Friends. He tried to portray them as squeaky clean. He made an error when referring to his hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). It was not the ears of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes that pricked up at one stage in our proceedings, but his horns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
Amendment No. 139 is particularly significant. Part of our difficulty is that we may not have the opportunity to debate clause stand part later, because we dealt with that in our fifth sitting between c. 163 and 237. Therefore, the importance of the amendment must relate to the fact that there is no likelihood of such a debate, although the Minister said in c.237 that he would ask the Committee to endorse clause 28 when the time came. It would be helpful to know if there will be an opportunity to debate clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes referred to amendment No. 139 as being a five-year preventative measure. That theme was picked up by the hon. Member for Ipswich. It would be helpful if they and their hon. Friends referred to Second Reading on Monday 6 March, which seems like many moons ago, be they full moons, half moons or new moons, when the Secretary of State for Scotland said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am on record saying that I do not envisage it being appropriate in the first few years, for a school that has achieved self-governing status to want to change its character in any major or fundamental sense. What happens in the longer term, as with local authority schools, is something that we will have to address in future."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purpose of the Bill is not to change the character of schools. Its purpose is to allow parents to achieve self-governing status for their schools if they so wish."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c.627]</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State for Scotland made it clear that he does not anticipate an early change of the fundamental characteristics of a school that has opted for self-governing status. Amendment No. 139 would write that sentiment into the Bill. That is especially important in clause 28 because, of all the clauses in the enabling part of the bill, as opposed to the latter part which is more likely to have immediate implications, clause 28 goes to the heart of the matter. It is significant because, potentially, it could completely transform Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that it is not without significance that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). a constituency in which her party has some interest, suggested that his speech was pan of his election manifesto and that he clearly spoke for Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), I believe that the definition of a Scot is someone who lives in Scotland and identifies with the problems of Scotland irrespective of his ethnic origin. That is the most democratic definition of a Scot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Lady to pay no attention to the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart)? I said that I would use the speech given by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Committee many of us have found interesting comments that we shall use in our election addresses come the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the attention of Conservative Members the strength of feeling in Scotland about clause 28
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>975</span>
and why amendment No. 139 is so important, given that we cannot delete the clause entirely. The Scottish Secondary Teachers Association has not been quoted before the Committee. It is a small but important organisation. It is said of clause 28:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is one of the most potentially damaging parts of the Bill and should be deleted in its entirety."</p></blockquote>
The Dumphries and Galloway regional council, which is represented by the Minister of State who has been detained in the House on another matter and one of the refusniks, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), says that the clause should be deleted. The Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped is an organisation that I respect greatly and with which I worked closely in my previous occupation. It referred to clause 28 and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly this would affect children with recorded special educational needs, but would also affect the majority of children with learning difficulties who are not formally recorded. The cumulative effect will be to reduce choice for children with special needs. In some cases, there may no longer be a local school which will accept a child with learning difficulties and they may be forced into a Special School when this is not educationally appropriate. This is, of course, contrary to the Government's stated aim of increasing parental choice."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council attracted a great deal of attention on the Conservative Benches when we discussed special schools. Its briefing refers to subsections (1) and (2) of the clause and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any change in the characteristics of a school, desirable or otherwise, will have implications for parents of children attending the school, prospective parents and pupils and the community at large. We are extremely concerned that, although the education authority and religious bodies must be consulted about such changes, parents and the community are not specifically mentioned in the Bill. We consider this to be a serious omission".</p></blockquote>
Those comments go on and on. All of us could quote for several hours from the comments that we have received from organisations that follow the committee's proceedings with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes speaks about freedom, he should remember that freedom also involves responsibility. We intend that responsibility to the whole community is taken into account should there be move to change the fundamental characteristics of any school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to write amendment No. 139 into the Bill—bearing in mind the hon. Lady's specific knowledge of and concern and understanding for special education needs—it would not be possible for a self-governing school to change its characteristics to make the necessary provision for special education needs under clause 16(4) for five years. Therefore, by accepting the amendment, it would not be possible to increase the provision for special education needs which the government consider it necessary to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, as I thought I made clear earlier, secondary and primary schools in Scotland already take account of special education needs. The danger of the Bill is that we may, by default, lose too early the guarantee of that provision. The SPTC commented on that issue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"SPTC believes that comprehensive (by this we mean nonselective) education might well be compromised by these proposals"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>976</span>
the SPTC refers here to clause 28—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and that would be more honest to have an open and informed debate about its successes and failures, rather than allowing it to be incidentally eroded as a consequence of this proposed legislation."</p></blockquote>
That is a clear comment from an organisation that has been involved in this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the SPTC brief. The council said that it wanted a well-informed debate, but any such debate is bound to show that the five-year restriction could have the opposite effect of what is wanted. That is why the council requires a well-informed debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman has missed the point that clause 28 contains the potential for academic selection which may well have implications for people from all levels of intellectual ability. The SPTC says that the Bill could have serious consequences. It seeks an informed debate, but, because of the pressures of time and for other reasons, the Committee is not holding one. The SPTC asked that we do not allow the argument to be accepted by default as a result of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear that the five-year breathing space is important. If a school decides to opt out— only a few will—there must be a required time for the board of management to come to grips with its responsibilities before considering changing the fundamental characteristics of the school. Five years is a reasonable length of time for a board of management to come to grips with realities. I regard it not as a wrecking amendment but as one that will provide a safeguard for local communities and schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall raise many other issues, such as that of special education, when we debate later amendments. I hope that Conservative Members will take account of the points made by various organisations in Scotland about the clause's implications. Amendment 139 would at least give us an opportunity to incorporate into the Bill a safeguard that would benefit pupils, parents, communities and the whole of Scotland. Scotland has a particular education system and any fundamental changes should be thought out gradually, not introduced immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind Conservative Members of the key words pronounced by the Secretary of State for Scotland on Second Reading. The amendment would fulfil his commitment, so he should support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment would have the effect that no change in the characteristics of a school could take place within the first five years of its becoming self governing. The characteristics in question would be those defined in clause 16(4): the age range of the school, whether it is single sex, whether it is denominational, and so on. It is characteristic of the Opposition's approach to the Bill—on this occasion I include the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing)—that once again they have tabled an amendment that would work directly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>977</span>
against that which they are trying to promote. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) has pointed out, one effect of the amendment would be that, during the five-year period, self-governing schools could not make any new provision for special education needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has also received a briefing from the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped. It states that, if clause 28 were taken literally, the school board would have to go through the rigmarole of balloting parents and seeking the Secretary of State's permission before it could provide any new provision for even one child with special needs who entered a community. Is that the Minister's intention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a question that we have already dealt with, and I gave some undertakings in that respect. The amendment, which I assume that the hon. Lady supports, would freeze the whole system for five years. If she believes that the Bill is an impediment to the growth of special needs provision, the amendment would make it considerably worse. I was very surprised when the hon. Lady spoke in support of the amendment because I had assumed that she would oppose it in view of her sensible arguments about the need for flexibility in the provision of special needs education. She has fallen into a trap which we have grown accustomed to the Labour party falling into. It is common ground between both sides of the Committee that we want to protect and encourage provision for special needs. For that reason, if no other, I could not accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) pointed out in a splendid speech—and, given the hour of the morning that it was made, a remarkable speech—it would be arbitrary to prevent a school from adapting to changing circumstances and demands for five years. When circumstances change, the proper thing to do is to consider each case on its merits. A school will have to decide whether it wants to change. It will have to ballot the parents and then put its case to the Secretary of State. He will, in his usual reasonable fashion, have to take account of all the factors and circumstances. If one factor is that the school has only been self governing for, say, two years, that will certainly weigh with him. Indeed, he will generally regard that as a very strong argument against making any further substantial change in the school for the time being. However there is no reason why he or the school should be precluded from considering an exceptional case where there are good external grounds for making the change before five years have elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 140, in page 18, line 8, after 'authority', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the teaching and non-teaching staff of the school."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 141, in schedule 7, page 58, line 4 after 'ballot', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"including information as to the views of the teaching and non-teaching staff on the change in characteristics which is proposed,".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 195, in schedule 7, page 58, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) informed at least 21 days before the date of the ballot about the possible implications of the school securing a change in characteristics."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are eminently reasonable amendments, like most of the amendments that we have moved during the many hours of our debates. I have not been keeping track of them in the way that the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) apparently has. Despite the 87 hours of debate and the reasonableness of our amendments, we have not made much headway with the Minister. Nevertheless, I hope that we can make progress with this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 140 requires boards of management, after passing a motion to change the school's characteristics, to consult the teaching and non-teaching staff at that school. Clause 28(2) already requires boards of management to hold consultations with their education authorities about any changes of characteristics that they seek. In the case of a denominational school, the boards of management
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>979</span>
must consult also the Church or denominational body
	<br><blockquote><p>"in whose interests the school is … managed."</p></blockquote>
That is an odd phrase, because the Government maintain always that schools operate in the interests of pupils, and not in the interests of any particular group that manages them. However, subsection (2) suggests that, under the new scheme, denominational schools will be managed in the interests of the Church or denominational body and not of pupils. Given what the Government have said, that is an odd choice of phrase. Nevertheless, consultation will be required by boards of management with the Church or denominational body in those instances, and with the education authority in all instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the people working in a school have an equally direct interest in any changes in characteristics that might be mooted for that school. They are at least as interested as the education authority, which no longer will be involved directly in running the school. They are as equally interested as the Church or denominational body with which the school is connected. Teaching and non-teaching staffs depend for their livelihoods on the school and the work that they do for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes in characteristics, such as in nursery-provision, special education needs, academic selection, or single-sex status, will have a direct and immediate impact on the working lives of the teaching and non-teaching staffs. Therefore, it is reasonable that boards of management are required to consult those staffs in the same way that they must consult education authorities and, where appropriate, the Church or denominational body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it might be reasonable in certain circumstances, the amendment does not suggest that the teaching and non-teaching staffs should have some power or influence over the changes in characteristics—far less a veto. The amendment seeks simply to require boards of management to consult. They should ask the teaching and non-teaching staffs for their views, inform them of their resolution and discuss with them the implications of parents adopting that resolution in a ballot. I hope that the Minister will accept that reasonable principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 141 refers to schedule 7(4), to the information available to parents in the ballot that decides whether a particular set of characteristics will be changed. The amendment requires that that should include information on the views of teaching and non-teaching staffs on the changes to be voted on in the ballot. The Minister has accepted that in principle. It is reasonable to require information on the views of teaching and non-teaching staffs about proposed changes in the school's characteristics that are to be put before the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already argued about the accuracy of recollections of events in previous sittings, but I seem to remember that the Minister accepted our suggestion in principle. I hope that he will translate that principle into legislative wording which will ensure that it is carried out in practice. If the principle is correct, the practice should logically follow. Amendment No. 141 is an appropriate vehicle for translating that principle into practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is an interesting proposition. The interesting point would be the definition of "information". Has my hon. Friend any further views on the type of information that could be useful in allowing the people involved in the ballot to make a more reasoned judgment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All kinds of information would allow that. I shall discuss some of it in the context of amendment No. 195.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 141 is narrower, as it involves information specifically on the views of the teaching and non-teaching staff on the proposed changes. The Minister has accepted that parents should have that information before deciding how to vote in a ballot. Like amendment No. 140, this is a wholly reasonable amendment to write into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 195 may give the Government greater difficulties, given their track record on the matter. It adds a fourth subparagraph to paragraph (4) of schedule 7 requiring parents to be informed at least 21 days in advance of a ballot about the possible implications of a school changing its characteristics. That could encompass a much wider range of information to be made available to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, parents should be given the maximum amount of information about the implications of a change, particularly when there is so much scope for doubt or confusion when a school's denominational character is to be changed. There has been some lively controversy over that issue tonight, when we discussed the potential for schools to have a greater Islamic character. The implications on the school's curriculum could be profound, and its religious education provision would be changed substantially. The status of girls in gym activities may not be an obvious implication of a change in denominational character and should be made clear to parents before they take a collective decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much this evening about the supposed freedom of Islamic communities to set up Islamic schools, but a great deal of what Conservative Members have said is pure hogwash and largely hypocritical. I am perplexed about how they can reconcile the talk about greater freedom for Islamic religious feelings with their acceptance of the requirement in the Education Reform Act 1988 that religious education in schools should have a predominantly Christian character—a novel provision introduced into the legislative requirement covering religious education. The Government have agreed—presumably with the support of all the Conservative members of the Committee—to a wholly unjustifiable imposition upon Islamic parents and children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not be aware that I have tabled amendments tonight relating to religious observance in Scottish schools. From what he has said, may I assume that, in principle, those amendments will have his support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not said what the amendments contain, so I cannot say one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
There is a contradiction in the attitude taken by Conservative Members on opted-out schools in England. They advocate that schools should opt out so that they can have a stronger Islamic character, yet they require that religious education in those schools should be predominantly Christian in character. It is rank hypocrisy on the part of Conservative Members to speak about the rights of Islamic parents to set up schools that suit their religious views, and at the same time to impose upon them a Christian style of religious education. Conservative Members cannot resolve that contradiction. Unless they make up their minds which way they are facing, I do not see why the Opposition should be receptive to their arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty can easily be resolved. The insistence of many Conservatives that the Education Reform Act 1988 should include a provision for a compulsory act of religious worship every morning and for religious instruction to be predominantly Christian was right and proper. Unless those who are being brought up in our schools today understand the Christian heritage of this country and all that has gone before, they will not be equipped to understand how we have got where we are and how to carry on from here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree entirely with what my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said, and I am trying to explain how it is possible to reconcile religious freedom with proper emphasis on the Christian religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"proper emphasis on the Christian religion"</p></blockquote>
belie the arguments of Conservative Members that people holding other religious beliefs should have full scope to develop their own forms of schooling. An Islamic form of mathematics would not be taught, nor an Islamic form of geography, biology or physics, just an Islamic form of religious education. The point of setting up Islamic schools would, presumably, be to give a distinctively Islamic slant to religious education. At the same time as saying that Islamic parents should have that right, Conservative Members have voted to require that religious education in all schools should have a predominantly Christian character. That is an absolute contradiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman gets around to reading what he has just said, he will realise that it is nonsense. People who live in the United Kingdom and wish their children to have education beyond schooling will wish them to be equipped to be acceptable to the senior academic institutions in this country. On the basis of the hon. Gentleman's comments, none of those children would be acceptable, because they would not have passed examinations that would have made them acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstood entirely the point that I was making. His remarks imply that he is backpeddling furiously
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
away from the notion of establishing schools with a special Islamic character. That is symptomatic of the problem that arises when the inconsistency in the position of Conservative Members is exposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts forward a position that has never been taken by Conservative Members. He also exhibits a contempt for, and misunderstanding of, Islam that will be widely reported. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The raucous laughter of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) will be reported by 	<i>Hansard</i> and will be widely reported elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman concede that part of the background to the Bill is the wish of Islamic parents to send their daughters to Catholic schools? It is a matter not of religion, but of parental choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendments deal with consultation with teaching and non-teaching staff. That is what we should be discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely so, Mr. Martin. I was giving examples to illustrate the possible implications referred to in amendment No. 195, when a school secures a change in characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implications are not understood by Conservative Members. They do not even know, when they passed the Education Reform Act 1988, for what they were voting. They think that they passed an Act that would give greater freedom to Islamic parents to set up distinctively Islamic schools, but they voted for an Act that imposed upon such parents and pupils greater constraints than were implicit in the law previously. There had been no requirement that religious education must have a predominantly Christian character. If Conservative Members argue that Islamic parents are crying out for their own schools, it puzzles me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I heard you clearly instruct the hon. Gentleman to speak to consultations with staff and schools, which is what the amendments are about. I have been trying to follow what the hon. Gentleman is saying and to relate it to your instructions. Frankly, I am at a loss. All that the hon. Gentleman has been discussing is an education Act that has little to do with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right; we should be restricting our remarks to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Martin. That is what I am endeavouring to do. Amendment No. 195 contains no mention of teaching or non-teaching staff; it says simply that parents who are about to vote in a ballot should be informed about all
	<br><blockquote><p>"the possible implications … of a change in characteristics"</p></blockquote>
of a school. It has been put about in the Committee that one possible implication of a change in characteristics would be to give Islamic pupils a more distinctively Islamic education. Parents— particularly Moslem parents—in England should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
warned that the Education Reform Act passed by Conservative Members requires a pupil to receive religious education that is predominantly Christian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is shaking his head; does he wish to tell me that children in England and Wales, whatever their background and even in Islamic schools, do not have to receive a religious education that is predominantly Christian in character? The Minister has ceased to shake his head; perhaps he agrees with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to incur the wrath of the Chair, Mr. Martin, but may I advise the hon. Gentleman to examine the Education Reform Act? He will not then be in danger of misleading the Committee—perhaps unintentionally—about its provisions. What my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was saying is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear what part of the statement of the hon. Member for Eastwood the Minister is referring to. I am happy to be put right by the Minister if I am wrong on that specific point. As the Minister, the man who knows everything, is not putting me right, I must have been correct all along. It is wrong for hon. Members to give the impression to Islamic parents in England and Wales that, in setting up schools of a supposedly Islamic character, they can get away from the obligation under the Education Reform Act that religious education has to be predominantly Christian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since when have the provisions of the Education Reform Act applied to Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not, but, as the hon. Member for Eastwood must realise—I said it clearly—amendment No. 195 is trying to ensure that parents get an accurate picture of the possible implications of changes in the characteristics of a school. I gave the example of an inaccurate interpretation that was being put about by Conservative Members of possible changes in characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of your strictures, Mr. Martin, but if the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) looks at the Education Reform Act he will find that it includes provision for the disapplication of the requirement on collective religious worship of a broadly Christian character. The hon. Gentleman's failure to appreciate that is leading him into a false argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to pursue that point further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the Act here and may be able to help the hon. Gentleman. Section 9(3) says?
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the parent of any pupil in attendance at any maintained school requests that he be wholly or partly excused"—
	<ol>
	<li>from religious worship in the school;</li>
	<li>from receiving religious education given in the school in accordance with the school's basic curriculum; or</li>
	<li>both from such attendance and from receiving such education;</li>
</ol>
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
the pupil shall be so excused accordingly until the request is withdrawn."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That subsection does not fulfil the requirement that the hon. Gentleman suggests that it does. It refers to the individual right of conscience of an individual pupil to opt out of religious education, but that does not mean that the religious education given in the school would be altered by the subsection or could escape from its characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) was quite right about individual pupils. However, section 7(6) of the Education Reform Act provides for the disapplication of the provision for collective worship of a broadly Christian character if the standing advisory council on religious education determines that it is not appropriate for a particular category of school. Provisions in that Act apply to a number of different categories of school in England and, as we are not here to discuss that Act, I am sure that you, Mr. Martin—you are being extremely patient—would call us to order if we attempted to discuss them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles would do well to study the Education Reform Act before seeking to instruct the Committee on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments conflict with my understanding of the Education Reform Act, so I shall study section 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Gentleman's understanding of the Education Reform Act on this point? If he would answer that question, we could then make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall like to hear the hon. Member's understanding of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair always makes excellent points, Mr. Martin. I frequently compliment the Chair, which is the fount of all wisdom and keeps us on the right track, even at this early hour when we have a great deal of work in front of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 195 deals with the need to give 21 days' notice of any characteristics of a school that may be changed. My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has stuck to denominational characteristics. But the amendment seems modest in relation to the enormous sensitivity of some characteristics that have, rightly, been highlighted by Conservative Members, and by my hon. Friend. Would he like to expand on the need for information —even consultation and debate— on the sensitive subjects that could be relevant to the balloting procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not catch all of my hon. Friend's intervention. I was desperately trying to read section 7 of the Education Reform Act. Perhaps my hon. Friend could summarise his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene to clarify my previous intervention.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>985</span>
In view of the new sensitivity that is being shown by both sides of the Committee on denominational characteristics and of the importance—and modesty—of amendment No. 195, perhaps my hon. Friend will agree that the amendment is over-modest. Should we not be considering consultation as part of the balloting process? What is at issue is the sensitivity of the subject; we should not be taking sides and favouring the Moslem or some other religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The change in characteristics is the key to amendment No. 195, and it is most important that parents be informed of the implications of proposed changes in characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether I was mistaken to say that amendment No. 195 would find least favour with the Government, but I hope that amendments Nos. 140 and 141 are so transparently reasonable that the Government will take them on board. Amendment No. 141 merely puts into practice the principle, which is accepted by the Minister, that views of teaching and non-teaching staff should be made available to parents prior to a ballot. Amendment No. 140 merely requires the board of management to consult teaching and non-teaching staff, not to take their advice or instructions. It, too, is so reasonable as to be acceptable. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to surprise the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). Contrary to what he said, I am not unsympathetic to amendment Nos. 195 and 141. In a debate on clause 2 on 21 March, we considered an amendment similar to amendment No. 140. I said then that teaching staff will have elected representatives on the board of management and it will be part of their job to know the views of those whom they represent. I accept that the staff of a school will have an interest in a proposal to change its characteristics, and will have views about the merits of the proposal that should be taken into account. Since the constitution of a board of management provides for staff views to be fed into consideration of such matters, amendment No. 140 is unnecessary. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will vividly remember our extensive debate on that subject; I feel sure that he would have made a characteristically fulsome speech on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In consideration of schedule 3—in many ways it is parallel to schedule 7—the Committee also considered an amendment similar to amendment No. 141. I said that it would be possible to achieve the required effect administratively, by means of the Secretary of State's guidance issued under paragraph 2 of the schedule. The same argument applies here. The amendment makes a valid point, which we would happily consider for inclusion in guidance in due course, but it is not necessary to insert it in the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is a parallel. I have already given a commitment on that, which I now give again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 141 and 195 make the valid general point that voters in a ballot on a change of
	<span class='label label-info column'>986</span>
characteristics must be given adequate information to enable them to form a proper view, the Committee will recall that when we debated schedule 3, I accepted an amendment that provided that the information going to each voter with the ballot paper should include such information
	<br><blockquote><p>"about the consequences for the school of acquisition of self-governing status as may reasonably be expected to enable him to form a proper judgment".</p></blockquote>
It is reasonable and logical to have a similar provision in schedule 7. If the hon. Gentleman cares to withdraw the amendment, I shall undertake to bring forward an equivalent amendment to that already made in schedule 3. I am sure that the Committee will accept my undertaking and I hope that we can proceed to further consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not convinced by the Minister's assurances. We should look closely at what the Minister has told the Committee, instead of being anxious to get to our beds. Otherwise, like Conservative Members, we risk letting anything slip through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider the Minister's words carefully. For example, he said that amendment No. 140, which would require full consultation with teaching and non-teaching staff, was already covered because teaching staff were represented on the board of management. But who represents the non-teaching staff? The other question is who speaks for the teachers' unions. The Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Professional Association of Teachers may all take different views from the person who represents teaching staff in general on the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There still remains a necessity for consultation with teaching staff and non-teaching staff. The Minister has not convinced me, nor my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), that he has covered that important area. There are grounds for grave disquiet that the change of characteristics could be railroaded through by the procedures that exist in the Bill without proper consultation with those most directly affected. The teaching and non-teaching staff directly employed do not have control over the change of characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to amendment No. 141, the Minister went on to give us the old story that he did not think it necessary to include any such commitment in the Bill. But the Minister does not think it necessary to include any commitment that would remove from him the power to get away with whatever he can. He said that he would consider including the commitment in some sort of guidance that the Secretary of State for Scotland would issue later. That is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked again to take the Minister on trust. I am willing to take people on trust; I even bought a second-hand car from my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray). But I do not trust the Minister or the Secretary of State for Scotland. If I do not trust them, neither will anyone else. The Minister's assurance is completely unconvincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 195, the Minister said that he had already discussed that matter on schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why was the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, it is many weeks since we discussed schedule 3. Then, I was still naive enough to believe what the Minister told the Committee. Bitter experience has taught me that one cannot trust the Minister nor the assurances that he gives in the name of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to amendment No. 195, the Minister said that he accepted that parents should know the full implications of a change of characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he is unable to accept the Minister's assurances. Will he press the amendments, knowing that he is bound to lose? If so, he will have neither the commitment nor the amendments. It seems to be a weak negotiating position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) contains his excitement, I shall move on to other aspects of the amendments. I am not responsible for withdrawing the amendments or for not supporting them. Neither am I talking for the sake of talking. It is important that the Committee confronts the issues raised in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Minister to give us a clear statement of the Government's position. All we have at present is a bland assurance that he will do something at some time in the future. He has no intention of committing himself in detail to the various strands that I have yet to mention. I am sure that he is anxious to hear my comments so that he can give the sort of commitment that I seek on specific issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have heard what his hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said when he drew our attention to the parallels with our earlier discussions. I have given a commitment to the Committee to reflect on the spirit of the amendment. I am almost driven to conclude that the hon. Gentleman will not take yes for an answer. When he talked about teasing out the arguments, did he mean that he wanted to keep the Committee discussing an amendment, the principle of which I have already given an undertaking on? If so, that looks suspiciously like a filibuster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a complete disgrace to suggest that you, Mr. Martin, would allow a filibuster in Committee. If the Minister were saying that the answer is yes, and that he will accept the amendment, let us press it to a Division and that will be the end of the debate. But he is not. He is offering far less than agreement to the amendment. He wants it to be withdrawn, because he will not allow it to be supported unanimously by hon. Members. He wants to get away from such a commitment. So the answer
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
is a clear no. That is why we must continue to debate the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that my hon. Friend the Minister is right in principle to accuse him of filibustering? As long as it is in order with the Chair, that is a reasonable accusation to make. I am not challenging the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the logic of his argument is that Labour Opposition Members are now withdrawing their previous acceptance of the assurances given by my hon. Friend the Minister on schedule 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was clear from my contribution that the Opposition were not withdrawing anything at this stage. I have learnt from bitter experience that the Minister twists and turns. I do not know whether the commitments that he gave in our earlier debate will be honoured. I suspect that they will not. That is why I wish to ensure that the implications of the amendments are fully explored. Before the Minister gives us a commitment, we want to put those implications on the record. Once they are on the record, he can then give us a commitment that the requirements in the amendment will be met. I am making a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attempting to filibuster. The Bill has serious implications for Scottish education. It is our role as Members of Parliament who represent Scottish constituencies to ensure that it is debated thoroughly. Conservative Members do not wish that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had a timetable under which we could spend the rest of the year debating the Bill between 10.30 am and 1 pm and 4.30 pm to 10 pm, we should be happy to comply with it so that we could have a proper debate. It is the Government who have determined that we discuss the Bill at 2.30 am because they will not reach agreement with us. They want the Bill out of Committee before the Conservative party conference. That is why we are here. The Government Whip would conclude the debate now if we had given him 40 clauses in one go. But that is not the role of Members of Parliament. Our role is to scrutinise legislation, which is what we are trying to do. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is trying to silence the debate. That is regrettable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is also the role of Members of Parliament to ensure that whatever goes on the statue book makes legislative sense. If, for whatever reason, an amendment is flawed and the Minister says that he accepts the spirit of the proposal, it means that the amendment which is tabled eventually by the Government will be capable of being incorporated in law. The hon. Gentleman seems to have missed that point completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, that was exactly the point that I was looking for. I was waiting for the Minister to explain why the amendments were technically flawed and why he wished to remould them so that they covered the issues we raised. But he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
never made any such reference. It was the Minister's assurance that was technically flawed. He said that the member of staff representing the teachers on the board of management could be taken as covering the necessity of consulting the non-teaching staff in the school. Such a statement is flawed. The future employment prospects of janitors, secretarial staff and domestic cleaners could be compromised by the conduct of the board of management. They will not be represented on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. He has a point in that the amendment refers to the need to consult teaching staff. I argued that they were represented on the board of management. On 13 April 1989, I expressed the same argument in response to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), when I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So although the point in amendment No. 171 is perfectly reasonable"—</p></blockquote>
I was referring to staff consultation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"writing it into the Bill is not an appropriate way to deal with the matter."</p></blockquote>
At 9.45 pm, the hon. Lady responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In that case, I shall not press the amendment."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 13 April 1989; c. 684.]</p></blockquote>
Why is the hon. Gentleman seeking to detain the Committee at 2.35 am on a similar issue that the hon. Lady accepted after I had given her the same undertaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misleads the Committee again. The circumstances in which he gave that commitment to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill are entirely different from the present circumstances. Clause 28 is the most important clause in the Bill; it could wreck Scottish education and reintroduce selective schools. We have not debated that provision before. The Minister has an advantage over me in that he has three full-time civil servants who dash out for copies of 	<i>Hansard,</i> hand them to him and tell him what to say. I do not have that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not be able to have copies of 	<i>Hansard</i> put into his hands, but he can rely on my memory of the exchange between the Minister and myself. At the time, the Minister undertook to allow the views of teaching and non-teaching staff to be sought before a school went to ballot. It is correct that he acepted the principle of that proposal, so we withdrew the amendment. But tonight, as my hon. Friend said, in response to a more serious issue, albeit with a similar principle, the Minister said that teaching staff would have the right to express their views through the board. He said nothing about non-teaching staff. That makes me wonder how seriously he took his earlier undertaking, when I was trusting enough to accept his word and withdrew the amendment. My hon. Friend is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend underliness the necessity for the Committee to scrutinise the clause. During a previous sitting, I remember clearly Conservative Members baying that Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
Members were frightened to debate clause 28. Yet, when we try to do so, we are accused of delaying the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are arguing that we should drop the amendments, and just push through clauses 28, 29 and 30 without debate. It is not Opposition Members who are inconsistent. We have always wanted to debate the Bill clause by clause, line by line. One moment Conservative Members want to debate the Bill, but the next they argue that we should all go home to bed and not debate it. When to conclude the debate comes under the control of the Government Whip. He is the reason why we are still here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no reticence on the part of Conservative Members to debate the Bill. From what I have observed in the Committee, the Opposition have prevented us from getting on with debating the Bill today. For the record, the hon. Gentleman should read column 684. There I referred to amendment No. 171, which follows the same principle as the amendment in which the hon. Gentleman claims to be interested. I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Amendment No. 171 requires a statement of staff views to be circulated with the ballot paper. I recognise that the staff will have relevant views and that they undoubtedly have an interest. However, the Bill should not give any one group the right to have material circulated with the ballot paper, particularly as it could not easily be defined what other groups might claim similar interests."</p></blockquote>
Following that explanation, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In that case, I shall not press the amendment."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 13 April 1989, c. 684.]</p></blockquote>
That does not stack up with the argument of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). If my commitment then was satisfactory to the hon. Lady, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will say why that commitment is not acceptable now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is always keen to stay in order, so I do not see how he can intervene in my speech by referring to an answer that he gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we are discussing refer to clause 28. This is not the first debate on clause 28— we had one earlier this evening when many of the contributions from Conservative Back Bench Members confused matters and led to a fog descending over the implications of clause 28. Does the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) speak for the Government? Does the Minister agree with him or with the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), who said very different things in his contribution? The hon. Member for Eastwood said something else. We must find out exactly what information will be available for parents. The Minister said that the information provided to parents under amendment No. 195 would be such information about the consequences as they might reasonably expect to have. Who will decide what is reasonable and in how much depth will the implications be considered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many issues to be clarified following contributions from the likes of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman in clarifying my view of his attitude to the offer made by my hon. Friend the Minister. He appears to be suggesting that he will not take yes for an answer. If it is suggested at the end of the debate that the amendment be withdrawn, I might suggest to my hon. Friends that we should not allow that to happen so that it is rejected. I would then suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that we leave the matter there and take the hon. Member for Dundee, East at face value. We will know that he is not serious about tabling amendments to be written into the Bill. In my 10 years' experience of Standing Committees, I have never known an Opposition Member to be unprepared to accept a Minister's willingness to accept the spirit of an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that we should take the hon. Member for Dundee, East at his word and ensure that amendments are not allowed to be withdrawn but are pressed to Divisions. I shall then suggest to my hon. Friends how they might vote, and that will be the end of the matter. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) laughs, but we should take the comments of the hon. Member for Dundee, East at face value and ensure that we dispose of the matter so that is it not brought up again on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I hope that that suggestion will be ruled out of order. We are not playing games but trying to formulate legislation. Is a member of the Committee suggesting that the law will be formulated in a way simply to satisfy his petty annoyance and irritation at a quarter to three in the morning? Let us take our business far more seriously than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was intervening in the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). I have no control over what the hon. Gentleman said in that intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It is in order for members of the Committee to vote for or against an amendment. I am trying to clarify the uncertain views of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). If the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) asked leave to withdraw the amendment and the Committee decided in its wisdom not to grant that leave, a Division would have to take place on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Part of the legislative process is that a Bill must be legislatively acceptable to the Government. If the Opposition wish to table an amendment, that must be legislatively acceptable to the Government. If the amendment is flawed, it will not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nonsense that we have heard has no connection with good legislation. It is a filibuster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The hon. Gentleman knows Committee procedure, as does the hon. Lady. In time she will be as knowledgable as the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The question is not how knowledgable I am about procedure. I am making a sensible point—that when debating such matters and voting on them, we are supposed to do so on the merits of the issue, not on whether we are feeling petulant about the Committee's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I assure the hon. Lady that if common sense prevailed, we should not be sitting here now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin, for allowing me to continue my contribution. I have been prevented from saying anything for almost 10 minutes because of interventions by Conservative Members who seem determined to filibuster and to make the debate last as long as possible. I wish to speak about the implications of the amendments, but Conservative Members do not wish to debate them. I want clarification from the Minister on the doubts that some contributions from Conservative Members have sown in my mind about the sort of information that will be provided to parents and the consultation with teaching and non-teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave a nod of agreement on consultation with teaching and non-teaching staff and parents being provided with full information on the implications of changing a school's characteristics. But he must convince the Committee that he will go into detail on the sort of consultation and information that will be made avaialble and that that will cover the many areas that have caused anxiety on the Opposition Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman is doing as the hon. Member for Maryhill suggested and is trying to make a reasoned case for his amendment. I wonder who would help him to form a judgment if I confirmed that all three amendments are technically defective for various reasons. It would not be possible for the Committee, if it were so inclined, to accept them without creating a deficiency in the Bill. The best possible undertaking is the one that I have already given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the best possible result would be the sort of commitment that he had given. I do not accept that. The amendments may be technically flawed, but the Minister must give a commitment to introduce technically correct amendments to give effect to the principles enshrined in the flawed amendments. He has not given such a commitment. I do not wish to detain the Committee, but he is saying that I should be rushed into accepting whatever he says. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes threatened me that, if I did not shut up, he would use his influence on the Government side of the Committee to do the dirty on teaching staff and non-teaching staff. I do not give in to such threats. I was not sent down here to be told by English Back Benchers to shut up. I shall not shut up just before the hon. Gentleman threatens me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To show how tolerant I am, I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be aware that Back Benchers on both sides of the Committee have rights. When the Minister gives commitments to one political party he has to carry members of other parties with him. He has to carry Conservative Members with him when he gives commitments to five Opposition Members. If the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) wants to improve the Bill with an amendment, he has to carry with him not only the five Members on his side of the Committee but the Members on our side, too. He may not be impressed by the Minister's commitment, but if he were, and the mover of the amendment sought leave to withdraw it, a majority of Members on this side would have to be persuaded to follow that course. The hon. Gentleman does not like being told to shut up. Of course he can speak as long as he likes, but he will not achieve his objective unless he carries Conservative Members with him. We shall have to agree or disagree with any motion to withdraw the amendment and if the hon. Gentleman does not persuade us—for he has to persuade us as well as his being persuaded by the Minister—if the hon. Gentleman or the mover of the amendment is to persuade us not to vote—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bringing my short intervention to a close, Mr. Martin. I am simply pointing out to the hon. Member for Dundee, East that he is not the only one who has to be persuaded—in his case by the Minister. A majority of Conservative Members, too, have to be persuaded by him, and, so far, he has not succeeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes intervenes, the longer he speaks and the more cause he gives me to doubt whether the Minister will deliver on his commitment. Apparently he may not be able to do so because the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will gang up to do the Minister down and wreck the Committee. That gives me all the more reason to continue with the debate and try to convince the hon. Gentleman of the solidity of my case. Will he now allow me to continue? I have been trying for about half an hour to come to the substance of the amendments and I have been prevented from doing so by constant Conservative interventions. Here comes another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that the hon. Gentleman is being provoked, and I am grateful to him for giving way to me. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, however, made the simple point that every member of the Committee has a vote and it is up to every member to exercise that vote in the light of the debate. The hon. Member for Dundee, East has not yet convinced me of his case, but no doubt after a further hour and a half of his eloquence to which we shall presumably be treated I might conceivably be convinced—at about 4.30 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood tempts me, but I am getting a whisper from my
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
side of the Committee to restrict my speech to five minutes. It is important to give other hon. Members the chance to contribute to the debate. We know that when the time is up, the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), will quickly close the debate on the amendments. We should all keep our remarks pertinent to the debate to allow other hon. Members to speak. I have been trying to do that, but I have been prevented by interventions from Conservative Members, who seem determined not to discuss the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some aspects need clarifying. If parents are to be given information about the implications of changes of characteristics under the clause and its sister provision, clause 16(4), we must understand what those implications may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes clearly referred to the brief from the EIS, and to leaders of the Glasgow Moslem community who envisage using the opting-out procedure to establish Islamic schools in the state sector. He had to be interrupted by the hon. Member for Eastwood, who said that he was wrong, and that the Moslem community in Glasgow did not want purely Islamic schools. Where there is a substantial number of Moslem children in a school the Moslem community wants that fact reflected in the character of the school, without necessarily making other changes. That interpretation is entirely different from that of the hon. Member for Briggs and Cleethorpes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brigg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has to tell the Committee which of those interpretations will be given to the parents as information on changes of characteristics. Which, indeed, is accurate? If the hon. Member for Briggs and Cleethorpes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brigg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brigg and Cleethorpes. There is a tarmac company in Dundee called Briggs and I keep mixing it up with the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I am sorry to have caused him such great offence. He must read more into Briggs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brigg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—than I intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have to decide which of his two hon. Friends is telling the truth, which of the implications is accurate and which will be told to parents before they decide how to vote on changing the characteristics of their school. Which interpretation is given could influence voting. For children to go to a school entirely religious in character, as described by the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, is entirely different from their attending a multi-cultural school in which the different strands—Moslem, Protestant, Catholic or whatever—are reflected in the ethos of the school. Those important implications have not been clarified to me, and if I am not satisfied, how will parents be satisfied that they understand properly unless the Minister tells us exactly what will be possible?

Earlier, I was accused by the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes of treating Moslems as second-class citizens. Far be it from me to do any such thing; the 	<i>Hansard</i> report will show that I never said any such thing. I was also accused of wanting only the Irish to be allowed denominational schools, and told that my words would hang round my neck for many years to come. The only intemperate words spoken were those of the hon. Member for Eastwood, who showed great lack of consideration for the Catholic community in Scotland by equating its members with the Irish. He showed no consideration for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
Highland Catholics and those who come from an English or an Italian background. Despite the multi-faceted nature of the Scottish Catholic community, the hon. Gentleman classed its members all together as Irish. I am sure that the Catholic population in Eastwood will be interested to know the view of them held by their Member of Parliament. I shall now let someone else make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
