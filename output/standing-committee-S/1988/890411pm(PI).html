<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 6, line 27, leave out 'or' and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"school, a primary school which has less than three hundred registered pupils, or a".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 174, in page 6, line 27, leave out from 'nursery' to end of line 29 and insert 'school'.</p>
<p>No. 37, in page 6, line 28, leave out—
<br><blockquote><p>"and it may be prescribed that special schools shall also be eligible".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 97, in page 7, leave out lines 18 to 21.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments and I hope that you will forgive us, Mr. Martin, for taking some time to consider them. They go to the heart of the Bill. In many respects it is the Government who are on trial this afternoon. Over the past few days we have seen the Government deliberately try to avoid facing up to the issues affecting Scottish education. The scribes are at hand this, afternoon looking for positive responses to amendments that many organisations in Scotland support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Do you agree that this Standing Committee is here to consider amendments as they crop up and not for the convenience of "scribes"? The purpose of the Standing Committee is to allow hon. Members to move amendments such as those that the Minister accepted this morning and on previous occasions. Would you rule that the Committee is for the benefit of hon. Members, not "scribes"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to express himself in any way that he pleases. There are facilities in the Committee for the press. Other hon. Members may refer to the press if they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted with that point of order, Mr. Martin. That is the basic difference
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
between much of the debate so far and our debate over the next two or three hours. One of the benefits for the Government is the ability to hide deliberations in Committee 400 miles away in London. Scottish people assume that because the Government are elected they are doing great things on their behalf. They do not know half of what is going on. Today they will. I welcome such points of order.<br><br>
The amendments pinpoint for the first time crucial issues affecting the passage of the Bill, which will eventually affect Scottish education. When the Government treat us with contempt, we do not mind. It is part of the rich tapestry of parliamentary life. But they must remember that this debate will also be talked about in Scotland because of the importance of the amendments. I am pleased that we already appear to have upset the Government; the programmed point of order emerged much sooner than I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman support amendment No. 174?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dignify that intervention by answering it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to proceed. I do not want to keep the Committee longer than the three hours that I intend to speak.<br><br>
This is a test of the Government. Already we can see them wriggling. Their friends are worried because these are specific amendments, which the Government will have to deal with later. The Government cannot try to lose them in technicalities and legal jargon.<br><br>
Many people think that education in Scotland is not safe in the Government's hands. The Opposition would accept that view. The Government are on autopilot and are extreme by any stretch of the imagination, but they should accept what are reasoned and reasonable amendments. Earlier, I made the point that what is out of sight is out of mind to the Government. The Government have no regard for the real aspects of education about which the Opposition are concerned. They claim that the Bill will extend parental choice and that it is permissive legislation. Who believes such nonsense? The Scottish electorate do not, and that is why it is a crucial test for the Minister to accept the amendments. They will limit the damage that the Bill will cause. The Opposition's role is to try to improve technical aspects of the Bill, but we should also attempt to blunt the excesses of the Government's extremism.<br><br>
Some Conservative Members participated in the debates, and voted on Second and Third Reading, on the Education Reform Bill. Some of them may wish to reflect that that Bill included amendments which were the same as those that we are pressing today. It is essential that we recognise that if we are to understand the Government's logic. We are seeking to put into this Bill what was contained in that legislation.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman therefore believe in the anglicanisation—<i>[Laughter.]</i>—of Scottish education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be able to deal with that on a later amendment. Anglicisation is the word that the hon. Gentleman is seeking.<br><br>
The Opposition do not see an inconsistency in what Conservative Members regard as the juxtaposition of contradictory ideas. As Scots, we believe that this is a uniquely objectionable Bill. We are consistent in arguing that the concessions that more amenable and reasonable Ministers accepted for the Education Reform Act 1988 should be written into the Scottish Bill. I hope that the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) will join in the debate soon because he was on the Committee considering that Act. We look to him for support on our amendments. Tonight will be a testing time for the Government, but Conservative Members will also have the opportunity to support amendments that they were happy to accept for parents, pupils and teachers in England and Wales. I challenge the Government to tell us whether they are willing to deny to the Scottish people what they accepted for the Education Reform Act 1988. It is a simple question. I hope that Conservative Members will tackle the issue and square it with their consciences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully and I think that I understand it. Will he explain to the Committee why he did not table an amendment similar to amendment No. 174 when the Education Reform Bill was before the House? 1 understand that he opposed and voted abainst that Bill; we fully endorse his right to do so. Why did he table an amendment for this Committee and then withdraw it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we do not get bogged down in tautology again. Surely the Minister would not expect me to table amendments to a Bill with which I was not closely involved—I had no Front-Bench responsibility for English education. The Minister's question reveals the difficulty that he will face in trying to square the facts tonight. He will have to answer the simple question why, when reasonable provisions were made in the Education Reform Act 1988, he is unwilling to include similar provisions in the Bill now before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that, but at present I am trying to establish another point. It is reasonable for amendment No. 174 to ask why special schools should be included under the Bill when the English Act did not include them. But I wonder why the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) tabled an amendment almost identical to amendment No. 174 but then withdrew it. Did he change his mind about special schools? Will he support Amendment No. 174?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our position on special schools will become obvious later in my speech. But let us hang here for a moment. I am interested in the comparison
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
with the Education Reform Act, which covers England and Wales. I am glad that the hon. Member for Hexham is here, as he brings great knowledge of the proceedings of the Committee on the Education Reform Bill. Contempt characterises the attitude of the Minister and of the Scottish Office towards Scottish education, but apart from that they have one simple matter to explain. I repeat my question in case anyone missed it. Why will the reasonable provisions made for England and Wales not be made for Scotland, too?<br><br>
Another aspect of the English dimension is the question why the Secretary of State for Education and Science thought it important to include such measures in the Education Reform Act. Is there an ideological difference between the Minister and the Scottish Office on the one hand and the Secretary of State for Education and Science and his Department on the other? Has there been a mistake, which the Minister will rectify later by accepting the amendments? Are there genuine differences between the approach in England and Wales and that in Scotland? Are education circumstances in Scotland so different that special treatment is required which the other 50 million people in Great Britain neither want nor need? The Minister may smile, but I await with gleeful interest his response to the debate. He has to explain why the Bill is different from the English legislation. I give him the benefit of the doubt; there may be special circumstances that we have missed.<br><br>
This is an irresponsible and dangerous Bill. Would it not have been more sensible to accept, as has been accepted in England and Wales, that the legislation is partly an experiment? In experiments laboratory conditions are set up so that one can step forward slowly and with confidence that the changes are supported—although that could never be the case in Scotland—and the effects may then not be so harmful. The Government carry out such experiments in England and Wales.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Education and Science believes that primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils may not be viable as opted-out schools. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has not said whether schools in Scotland with fewer than 300 pupils will be viable. It is interesting that experimentation in England and Wales is taken more seriously by the Department of Education and Science.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his comments because we are confused? He referred to exempting schools with fewer than 300 pupils, but the amendment refers only to primary schools. The Scottish people may be confused about the Labour party's attitude on this matter because it clearly does not know what it is talking about, but at least we should be informed of the hon. Gentleman's thinking.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was worthy of the level of contributions from Conservative Members and does not require a reply. Is it true that the Secretary of State for Education and Science
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
takes his responsibilities more seriously than Ministers in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible that the hon.Gentleman has been slipshod and has caused the confusion? The amendments would not achieve what he suggests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman can hear me. If he is being serious, I am sorry that he can hear me.<br><br>
I want to deal with the point about the confusion, hon. Members on the Conservative Back Benches do not know what we are talking about. We know what we are talking about and so do the Scottish people and those with education interests. Any confusion sets back the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), I was also puzzled. The hon. Gentleman argued that schools with fewer than 300 pupils would not be viable and should not be included for self-governing status.<br><br>
That argument could be put, but my hon. Friend asked why the hon. Gentleman had tabled an amendment that applies only to primary schools. It would prevent primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils from having self-governing status but would not prevent secondary schools with fewer than 300 pupils from doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. The amendment is about primary schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just said that the amendment is about primary schools. The Minister may snipe, but we look forward to his reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only primary schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can read the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way.<br><br>
The argument about experimentation seems to be niggling Conservative Members. Are the Scots to be treated as guinea pigs, as in other legislation, or will the Minister argue for safeguards to be written into the Bill, which in most people's minds is a leap in the dark?<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) asked about rural schools. The problems faced by rural schools throughout Scotland will be removed at a stroke if primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils are not eligible for self-governing status. The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside received assurances from the Minister that the matter would be considered further. The Minister could solve the problem this evening by accepting our amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
We are arguing for caution. We know that that word does not lie easy with extremism and Right-wing dogma. But the people of Scotland accept that there is an overwhelming case for caution, and caution underlines each of the amendments. I appeal again to the Minister to consider that.<br><br>
The theme that runs through the Government's attack on Scottish education has two aspects: it is an attack first on Strathclyde and secondly on comprehensivisation. Would it not be consistent for the Government to accept the amendment on primary schools so that they could unleash a full attack on comprehensivisation? There appears to have been little debate about or criticism of primary education, so why will the Government not be consistent and accept amendment No. 67, which would allow them to be consistent not only with their attack during the proceedings of this Committee but with their long-term aspirations to dispense with education authorities and undermine the comprehensive system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do you wish to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) should be careful about how he uses the word "you".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy in giving way. Amendment No. 67 applies exclusively to primary schools, as he agreed earlier. Now the hon. Gentleman is talking about comprehensive education, which occurs in secondary schools. There is an enormous amount of either incompetence or muddle. Anyone who reads the <i>Hansard</i> report of what the hon. Gentleman has said and who tries to relate it to the amendment, which is exclusive to primary schools, will realise that there is no connection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman's machine is not working.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) gives useful advice. Either the machine or the mind is not working. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has missed a great deal of the Committee's proceedings. I am not concerned about that, but I have to tell him that the thrust of the attack from his colleagues has been about comprehensive education—mainly in Strathclyde. We hope that he will grasp the point that accepting the primary school limit would be consistent with the deliberations in the Committee, which have appeared to exempt primary schools from the attack. Ironically, that would allow the Government to concentrate more vociferously on their real enemy: comprehensive education.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
That point is crucial to a comment by the Under-Secretary at the weekend, which was reported in <i>Scotland on Sunday.</i> When talking about comprehensive education, he
<br><blockquote><p>"claimed this had led to a 'reduction in the expectations of attainment.'"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although reference may be made to comprehensive education, hon. Members' speeches may not be dedicated to it. It may be mentioned only in passing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. Martin, but the point that we are making is crucial to the debate. The attack has been not on primary schools, but on the comprehensive system. The logic of the Government's position could best be served by their continuing to concentrate on comprehensive schools—accepting our amendment on primary schools would allow them to do that. However, I take your advice on that, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the explanation, but I now understand why the hon. Gentleman says that he is concentrating only on primary schools. Why, then, does his press release explaining the amendment say that all schools, including secondary schools, with fewer than 300 pupils will be affected by the Bill? Was there a change of view between tabling the amendment and writing the press release?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a bit of humility. This Government claim never to make any mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Admit it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gets excited at this time of the evening because dinner is approaching, but he should try to contain himself.<br><br>
The Opposition explained what happened. We have raised questions that the Government will have to answer, and there is no point in drooling over the details of the amendments. I wish to finish by—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it would be a long speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members encourage me to speak further. It is interesting to watch their faces when we discuss experimentation going wrong in Scotland, and why the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland cannot rise to the concessions that his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science made.<br><br>
Circular No. 10/88, produced by the Department of Education and Science, on grant-maintained schools under the Education Reform Act 1988 is interesting because it captures the aim of the English legislation which is similar to this Bill. Paragraph 5 of the circular states:
<br><blockquote><p>"All county and voluntary schools are eligible to apply for grant-maintained status except for</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) primary schools and middle-deemed-primary schools which do not have 300 or more registered pupils on the date of publication of their application."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
Paragraph 6 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State is empowered under the Act to extend eligibility to a category of smaller primary schools and middle-deemed-primary schools, or to all such schools, by means of an Order exercised by Statutory Instrument."</p></blockquote>
That is the caution—the Secretary of State has the power to come back by regulation, but the initial number is 300. The paragraph continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"His intention is to review the provisions for eligibility in the light of experience of grant-maintained status for larger schools and of the progress of local management within smaller primary schools. Nursery schools and special schools are not eligible for grant-maintained status under the Act."</p></blockquote>
That brings us to the crucial matter of special needs. Our amendment seeks to remove the power from the Minister, by regulation, to bring special needs schools into the opting-out provisions. The Bill does not allow him to do that, but he is taking the power to do so, by regulation. No sane person in education in Scotland, or in England and Wales, wants to take such a leap in the dark on such sensitive, emotive issues with people who have mentally and physically handicapped children. The Government are highly irresponsible to flout that power in the Bill, because they will not listen to groups who have expertise on special needs. That is one of the most dangerous aspects of the Bill, which we hope that the Government will seek to change this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If what the hon. Gentleman says is true, why did the Opposition table the same amendment as myself and other hon. Members?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is old ground. I shall emphasise the point made by the Minister of State, Department of Education and Science on special needs during the Committee stage of the Education Reform Bill. Hon. Members who populate Government Departments in England and Wales seem to be more sensitive and reasonable than this lot. The Minister of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It might save further debate to tell the Opposition that if they read the Bill slightly more carefully, they would know that amendment No. 631 is unnecessary. Clause 37(5) states, in effect, that county or voluntary schools are eligible for grant-maintained status, but that special schools are not. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee J,</i> 26 January 1988; c. 886.]</p></blockquote>
Those were copper-bottomed guarantees from an English Minister that special needs would not form part of the Education Reform Act. It is not only irresponsible but dangerous for special needs schools to be considered for opting-out because of the integrated nature of provision and the work done by education authorities. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will certainly develop that point, as she has more knowledge on the subject than all the Conservative Members of the Committee put together.<br><br>
Finally, what will it mean if the Government accept the amendments, as they will want to do to assuage public opinion in Scotland?</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not embarrass the hon. Gentleman again by asking him why he tabled an amendment in such terms, but why does he feel

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
that the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council is so wrong to press the Committee to accept the amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our position on special needs schools is clear. We are majoring on the two amendments that I have spoken about. For further debate, we can return to the other amendments. It is common practice in Committees to identify an issue and then ignore everything else while pursuing that attack. What will it mean if the Government accept the amendments? More importantly, what will it mean if they do not?<br><br>
In mainland Scotland there are some 3,000 schools. If we accept the wisdom of excluding the 203 special schools and the 1,307 primary schools, we find that almost 2,000 schools would initially be unaffected by the legislation. That would be an excellent victory for common sense: two thirds of all schools removed from the potential damage of the Bill.<br><br>
Equally important in terms of rural schools is the fact that 90 per cent. of all the primary schools in the Highland area would not meet the eligibility criteria for opting out. That would answer at a stroke the problems of rural schools that the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside mentioned earlier.<br><br>
The amendments are crucial, reasonable and common sense. The single most important objective that the Committee can pursue is to minimise the damage that the Bill can cause. Although the Minister has given assurances that may manifest themselves in amendments later, most Scottish people would be happier if there were cast-iron guarantees to exclude a large number of schools, thus avoiding the potential damage. However, if the Government do not accept that, they must ask themselves why the Secretary of State for Education and Science is going about his business more carefully, constructively and sensitively in all of those areas than the hon. Member for Stirling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a technical point, I should like to clarify whether if amendment No. 67 is negatived and my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) then wishes to put amendment No. 174 to the vote, we must give you advance notice, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Martin. This is the grand and much heralded assault by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) on the Government's education policy. I had planned to compare the hon. Gentleman to the grand old Duke of York, but that is an insult to the grand old Duke of York who at least got to the top of the hill. We know that this is the grand assault thanks to the hon. Gentleman's press release dated 3 April, reference PR 117/89. I do not know whether that means that the hon. Gentleman has released 117 press releases so far, but it would not surprise me. That press release was issued, before a meeting at 2 pm on Wednesday, 5 April, as a trailer for the grand assault.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central justifies the first amendment on the grounds that it would bring Scotland in line with England. <i>The Scotsman</i> of 6 April cites him as saying of the Minister:
<br><blockquote><p>"If he is applying the English prescription—let's have all of it."</p></blockquote>
That is a new development in Scottish Socialist thinking. There must have been a policy review. Is it a new principle that if something is implemented in England, similar proposals for Scotland should be identical whether or not Scottish circumstances suggest that that should be so?<br><br>
The press release continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"schools with fewer than 300 pupils should be excluded from opting out".</p></blockquote>
That was supposed to be the purpose of amendment No. 67. The hon. Member for Fife, Central tried to slap down my hon. Friends when they pointed out that the amendment would not achieve that. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that the amendment would achieve neither what the press release claimed, nor what the press, after the press conference, stated that it would achieve. The press consistently report that the hon. Gentlemen's amendment applies to 10 per cent. of secondary schools in Scotland, but it does not.<br><br>
There is no reason why Scotland should not have a more flexible system. The hon. Gentleman's allegation that the amendment would bring Scotland in line with England does not stand up either because the proposals for England give the Secretary of State the option either to reduce or to eliminate the threshold. The amendment achieves neither of its two objectives.<br><br>
Amendment No. 174 was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and other hon. Friends. We were surprised to see our names attached to it. The amendment paper for 4 April 1989 includes amendment No. 143, which is exactly the same as that tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, but which is signed not only by the hon. Member for Fife, Central but by the hon. Members for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Dunnachie) and for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). Conservative Members were delighted to see this Opposition amendment. We rushed to give the Labour party our support, because our names would not automatically have appeared on the amendment paper. It was with surprise and dismay—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. My hon. Friend has been making some important points in response to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). The hon. Gentleman was listened to carefully by the scribes, and unfortunately he is now detaining them in such a manner that they cannot pay attention to my hon. Friend's important remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that that is not a matter for me.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not making accusations about the press. I assumed that the hon. Member for Fife, Central could not take the heat. It is not surprising that he is not here.<br><br>
Opposition Members tabled an amendment that now appears in the names of my hon. Friends and myself. As it has been withdrawn, we can conclude only that either the Labour party has had a complete change of policy, or that Labour Members discovered that the amendment that they tabled after due consideration would do the opposite of what they thought. There is no third option. I would give way to the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen— [hon. Members "Where are they?"]—if they wanted to tell the Committee and the people of Scotland which explanation is correct. The hon. Member for Moray is in the clear because she did not sign the original amendment. Again, I call on the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen to tell us whether they are guilty of inconsistency or incompetence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend note that the only person on the Opposition Front Bench is a member of the Scottish national party? I see that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) returns at last.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to say that the hon. Member for Moray is following my remarks closely, as we follow her remarks closely. She has considerable interest in education for those with special needs, and we have discussed her views fully and sympathetically.<br><br>
Let it be understood that I gave the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen opportunity after opportunity to explain which of the alternatives I gave was correct. However, as I am in a charitable mood, I shall accuse Labour Members not of inconsistency, but of incompetence.<br><br>
This widely heralded attack on the Government consists of an amendment that would achieve neither of its stated purposes and one that would achieve exactly the opposite of what is was intended to achieve, and was therefore withdrawn. No wonder there is confusion among Labour Members. However, I pay tribute to the press department of the Labour party. At the bottom of the news release announcing the campaign of the hon. Member for Fife, Central on the amendments, it says "6 (Scotland) and 7". No better description could there be of the Opposition's policies on these matters than that they are at sixes and sevens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>[Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman served with me on the Committee that discussed the School Boards (Scotland) Bill. The Opposition tabled an amendment that sought to exclude from the ceiling powers the possibility that a particular school could take on the function of opening and keeping records of needs in respect of pupils with special educational needs. The Minister said in response:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is by definition, not a function that relates to a particular school."—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee, 24 May 1988, C.485.]</i></p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
The hon. Gentleman supported the Minister then, but by tabling this amendment now he is the one who is being inconsistent.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to special needs, to which I have not referred previously. First let me give the hon. Member for Fife, Central the good news that I am prepared to support amendment No. 37 on the assumption that my hon. Friend the Minister accepts amendment No. 174. In those circumstances, the hon. Member for Fife, Central might have a considerable victory regarding amendment No. 37.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central is on record as saying that "no sane person" would support amendment No. 174. By saying that, he is attacking not just himself and his hon. Friends—when they supported it through amendment No. 143—but the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. Hon. Members on the Committee sometimes agree with the SPTC and sometimes they do not. This amendment, which the hon. Gentleman says that "no sane person" would support, is from the SPTC, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Special schools should be allowed to become self-governing. For some pupils with special educational needs, integration into mainstream schools is not considered, by their parents, to be a satisfactory option. Increasingly, education authorities have attempted to integrate more pupils with special education needs into mainstream schools. Whilst we would not question the appropriateness of this policy, parents are concerned that this policy of integration is not always accompanied by ensuring that adequate facilities and resources are made available in the receiving mainstream schools.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to straighten out this issue. For whatever reason, the SPTC has not drawn a clear distinction between special schools and special educational needs. Those are two separate issues. Many of us are disappointed that that was not clarified in the SPTC's statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right to say that special educational needs and special schools are not identical. The SPTC goes on to explain its policy in that statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"If parents of children with special educational needs choose a special school for such children, that choice must be respected. If special schools are threatened with closure by their education authority, they should have the same opportunity to seek self-governing status as any other public school."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will doubtless give her views on that, but the Committee should consider what the SPTC says. It is an insult for the hon. Member for Fife, Central to talk of the SPTC as not sane. Depending on the debate, my hon. Friends and I may wish to press amendment No. 174 to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I respond now to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), who spoke so eloquently and enjoyably to his amendment.<br><br>
I, too, have followed the press releases and claims in the press about the amendments. I saw that the Opposition amendment was described as a great assault on the Government, but it has turned out to be the reverse of what expected, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has shown.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
If the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) had told the Committee that he had tabled the amendment by mistake, we should have understood. No one expects any hon. Member to be perfect and make no mistakes, but we are not clear what provoked such a major change in policy. We suspect that the amendment that seeks to take special schools out of the scope of the Bill was included as one of three that would enable the hon. Gentleman to claim that he was bringing the Bill into line with the Education Reform Act 1988. The hon. Gentleman nods assent.<br><br>
I try to follow arguments and to respond when they seem to be coherent and sensible. An acid test of the Opposition's competence is their ability to produce coherent amendments. We were told last week that the Opposition intended to move three amendments, all designed to bring the Bill more closely in line with English legislation. That is curious when the Opposition claim that the Bill represents the anglicisation of Scottish education. The amendments represent the anglicisation of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman justifies them by saying that we should do what we should do what is done in England.<br><br>
I repudiate that. The School Boards (Scotland) Act and this Bill are appropriate for Scottish education and we shall not accept proposals for Scottish education simply on the basis that that is what applies in England. I thought that that was the hon. Gentleman's position, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all the more extraordinary, given what the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was reported as saying in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 22 November 1988:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite Rifkind's claims to the contrary"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin. I am only quoting the newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Member should not quote from a newspaper in an intervention. He should know the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central was quoted in the newspaper as making it absolutely clear that he opposed what he said was the Secretary of State's determination to impose English solutions on Scottish education. Given what the hon. Gentleman is quoted as saying in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 22 November, surely his actions today are all the more extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find them incomprehensible, unless we take the hon. Gentleman's stance as meaning that if the Bill reflects English legislation in some respects, it should be identical, but that seems to be an absurd position to take. We wish the same choices and freedoms to be available in Scotland as in England, but we want legislation that is appropriate for Scottish circumstances.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the claim that in some way we support the anglicisation of Scottish education. Surely it is obvious that the Labour party in England and in Scotland is opposed to the concept of schools opting out of education authority control. If we can succeed in removing schools not only in England but in Scotland from the effects of the Bill, we shall table amendments to that effect. But that has nothing to do with the anglicisation of Scottish education. We are trying to ensure that as many Scottish schools as possible remain under our uniquely Scottish education system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that helpful intervention, because it focused the minds of members of the Committee on the salient point, which is that we should address ourselves to the principles and the arguments and produce legislation that is appropriate for Scotland. The hon. Gentleman, alas for him, has a Front-Bench spokesman who has sought to argue that the amendments should be accepted on the basis that they reflect what is in the English Act but who has not advanced one argument to support that case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. I am just about to explain that remark. There seems to be some confusion about the three amendments to which the press release refers, two of which we are discussing now. The hon. Gentleman has completely misread the English legislation in respect of the number of parents that is required to trigger a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making so many erroneous points that it is difficult to know when to intervene. He was about to refer to the difference between parents and pupils. He should not cast slurs on Opposition Members by suggesting that we are not aware of that difference. He should respond to our amendment, not subject us to withering waffle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is waffle; it certainly seems to be withering. The press release states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Labour's amendments are:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—that the requirement for 10 per cent. of parents to sign a petition for opting out is raised to 20 per cent."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish you, Mr. Martin, to call me to order for straying on to a later amendment, but the press release states that the amendments—that is, the two that we are discussing plus a later amendment—
<br><blockquote><p>"would bring the Bill into line with English and Welsh legislation."</p></blockquote>
They would not. They would require almost double the support that is required under the Education Reform Act 1988. The claim of the hon. Member for Fife, Central is incorrect. He has misread the English legislation. The charge of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood of his being either incompetent or inconsistent seems to be more inclined towards the former than the latter.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood spoke to the amendment on special schools. The Opposition's position is clear, and I shall not dwell on the reasons why they no longer support the proposal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0298">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
contained in that letter. They wish to see special schools excluded from the provisions. I acknowledge that that would be in line with English legislation. In their haste to deal with the matter, they tabled two amendments. One, which was suggested by the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, would have had precisely the opposite effect of including, at the outset, special schools in the scope of the legislation. I imagine that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood tabled such an amendment after the Opposition had withdrawn a similar proposal to enable the Committee to consider that argument. It was sensible of him to do so.<br><br>
The Bill provides a cautious approach to what should happen to special schools. Initially, they will not be eligible to seek self-governing status but, at some time in the future, the Secretary of State may make regulations, subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny, that would extend such eligibility to them.<br><br>
The more that I have listened to the arguments advanced against the provision by the hon. Member for Fife, Central, the more that I have been persuaded that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is right. The hon. Gentleman said that no one in his right mind would consider that special schools should become self-governing. Many special schools in Scotland that are run by the Spastics Society and other organisations are self-governing and carry out a splendid job. There is no reason in principle why special schools could not be operated by boards of management in the same way as other types of schools. In the distant future, there may be a Labour Government and if that were the attitude of the Opposition towards special schools, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has made a persuasive case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister continues to distort my remarks to try to generate some debate. He argued about existing schools that are not covered by the opting out proposals in the Bill, but he did not make that distinction in his wide diatribe about my attack on special needs schools. That is both unforgivable and quite wrong. Why were special needs schols not included in the Education Reform Act 1988 when it appears increasingly likely that they will be included in this Bill? That is the issue.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I have a number of responsibilities they do not include responsibility for the Department of Education and Science. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the Scottish education system is organised and funded on a different basis. He knows that the financial delegation that in England takes place automatically to all schools is not taking place in Scotland. I have no doubt that when my colleagues came to consider these matters during the passage of the Education Reform Act, they looked at the detailed questions that I have been considering since my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood tabled his amendment, which include how to deal with the funding arrangements. They would clearly have to be different from those which apply to conventional schools.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish first to answer the hon. Gentleman's point. I am trying to respond to a serious question. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) has a particular expertise in this area and I see her nodding in agreement with me: as that is an unusual occurrence I do want it to be interrupted.<br><br>
Special schools sometimes require additional resources for teaching or materials that will fluctuate according to the pupils. The system of funding that we propose for conventional self-governing schools, if I may use that phrase, would need to be capable of being used flexibly if we are to include special schools within the scope of the legislation. I imagine that that would be a much harder task for the Department of Education and Science, which has many more schools to deal with. We are now more than a year on and have had some experience of the legislation. In principle, I see no great difficulties— just as there are in principle no great difficulties preventing us from working out the funding arrangements for special schools run by voluntary agencies like the Spastics Society and others—that make it necessary to exclude special schools from the scope of the legislation. That is why I have cautiously provided in the Bill, as drafted, an order-making power for the Secretary of State to bring special schools within the scope of the legislation at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's arguments with great interest. He has told us before that education authorities will draw up their record of needs. He now tells us that the delivery of the system will be dependent on a special system of funding. How does he tie that into strategic planning to serve vast communities where there are small numbers of children needing special education in special schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see no difficulty in that respect. The education authority will still be able to look at the overall provision in its area. We are discussing whether a particular special school that wished to go for self-governing status should be able to achieve that. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has tabled an amendment which we shall debate later about the precise relationship between education authorities and the provision of services and self-governing schools. I think that that will provide an opportunity to raise the kind of question that the hon. Lady has in mind.<br><br>
There is a long tradition of education authority collaboration with other institutions on special needs and the placing of children in grant-aided and independent schools. That tradition would not prevent education authorities from working perfectly well with self-governing schools. The hon. Member for Fife, Central talked about no one in his right mind. The hon. Gentleman has used the views of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council to beat me on various matters—beat in the sense of flagellation rather than winning the argument. We listened very carefully to the arguments. The fact that the Scottish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
Parent-Teacher Council thinks that the Bill should be amended in this way is important, Substance is added to that by the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, with his experience and perspicacity, is of the same opinion. Therefore, I am happy to accept my hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been waiting patiently to hear the reasons for not bringing the Bill into line with the English legislation in respect of special schools. The only reason that the Minister has offered is that there is a unique difference between the two countries. The Department of Education and Science has too large an area with which to cope, but the Scottish Office can oversee a much smaller country. Is that why there is a difference between the Bill and the English legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. The Government start from the premise that self-governing status should be available to schools if they wish to choose that option and if there are no insuperable problems to overcome. It may be argued that, for special schools, there are particular difficulties. When the SPTC made representations and when the Opposition tabled the amendment, I was alerted to the interest in the matter. I considered it. When the amendment was withdrawn, I was surprised, and we have had no explanation. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood spoke to his amendment and it is clear that Conservative Members support the extension of the right of opting out to special schools. The only arguments that could be used against that are administrative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It is all very well to hold press conferences in Committee Room 18 and to brief the press outside the Committee Room, but, surely, it is not in order for hon. Members to contact the scribes within this Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My ruling is that it is not out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be fair, the hon. Member for Fife, Central has some explaining to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May we sum up the debate because I am confused? As I understand it, the Opposition tabled an amendment and then withdrew it. They then tabled an amendment that had precisely the opposite effect of what they intended. Then, they tabled an amendment which showed that they could not add up and they also tabled an amendment which showed that they did not know the difference between primary and secondary schools. In my hon. Friend's six years in Parliament, has he known the Opposition to flop so disastrously and so comprehensively?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will stick to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to answer my hon. Friend's question, but I am sure that the Committee and everyone else will form their own judgment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he would accept the amendment to allow special schools to opt out of education authority control. Will he confirm that that means that such schools will be able to keep records of need in respect of their own pupils? During the course of the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, the Minister said that, by definition, that function could not relate to a particular school. He said that the function could not be delegated even if a board wished that. Why is the Minister now allowing it in this Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should warn my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood of the effects of his amendment on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing with the hon. Gentleman's point at the same time as that of my hon. Friend.<br><br>
There will be some consequential amendments of a technical nature, but there will be no need for one of the type that the hon. Gentleman suggests. Education authorities will still be responsible for the records of need.<br><br>
On amendment No. 67, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) was right. The Opposition cannot work out percentages and they do not understand that there are secondary schools as well as primary schools. The press release that described the Opposition's amendments, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"schools with fewer than 300 pupils should be excluded from opting out proposals."</p></blockquote>
In fact the amendment relates only to primary schools. I wondered why. Perhaps it was a slip-up; perhaps it was a genuine attempt to make only those changes that would anglicise the Bill. But although the hon. Member for Fife, Central did not answer the question when he was asked directly he answered it, perhaps not meaning to, in his speech. The answer is obvious. If primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils were excluded about 1,900 schools out of a total of 2,800 in Scotland would be ruled out— almost 80 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two thirds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not two thirds, it is 80 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that it would be a good idea, but it is nothing but a wrecking measure. Having let clause 1, containing the principle of the Bill, through so quickly, the hon. Gentleman is now trying desperately to have the same arguments again. This is a clause 1 debate by the back door, continued by the hon. Gentleman now that he has discovered that perhaps he should have spent a little longer on the principle and a little less time on amendments that seem to have been tabled without much thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has now cracked it, will he accept it?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking me to say to 80 per cent. of Scotland's primary schools that they will not be able to benefit from self-governing status. I see no reason why primary schools of that size should be excluded. The hon. Gentleman did not explain why the amendment does not include secondary schools. If his were an argument of principle—that it might be difficult to make schools with fewer than 300 pupils viable—the Committee could have considered it. We are reasonable people; we would have examined the arguments. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will argue that later, or perhaps some of his hon. Friends will rescue him and put us under pressure. The hon. Gentleman did not include secondary schools because there are only 61 secondary schools with fewer than 300 pupils in Scotland— about 14 per cent.<br><br>
The amendment is an attempt to deny schools in Scotland the right to make use of the legislation. It reveals the true thinking of the Opposition. They believe that schools will take advantage of the Bill. That is why they will not answer the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. Because they believe that, they move amendments to remove schools from the scope of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shows concern about the position of secondary schools in relation to the amendment. In Dundee there are 13 secondary schools and the education authority aims to maintain a model size, with 600 pupils in each school. Neither the Minister nor the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) agrees with that, and they consistently press the education authority to close Dundee schools because they do not consider a secondary school with 600 pupils to be viable. Does the Minister intend to table an amendment that no secondary school with fewer than 600 pupils should be allowed to opt out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have not tabled such an amendment. I do not know whether my hon. Friends will have understood what the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) meant, as they may not know the background to what is happening in Dundee. Tayside regional council is trying to frustrate the parents' charter, which the hon. Member for Fife, Central recently told the Committee that the Oppposition fully supported— presumablty they had realised the error of their ways. Yet the hon. Member for Dundee, East tells us how praiseworthy the education authority is for frustrating the wishes of parents. When the hon. Gentleman tells us that the authority aims to have 600 pupils in every secondary school in Dundee he means that it intends to prevent parents from choosing which school to send their children to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: -As usual, the Minister misrepresents the position. I praise everything that Tayside education authority, which is forward-looking, has done, but I reopeat my question to the Minister. No school in Dundee has as few as 300 pupils, yet the Minister condemns Tayside education authority for keeping open secondary schools with 400 and 500 pupils. We assume that the Minister thinks that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
those schools are inviable, so why does he not table an amendment to the Bill which would prevent secondary schools with 400 or 500 pupils from becoming self-governing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be a little confused. When I refer to schools with 300 pupils that might be eligible for self-governing status, I mean schools with a capacity of approximtely 300. The hon. Gentleman is referring to schools with 300 pupils with a capacity of more than 1,000. Such schools are unable to attract parents and in Dundee they choose other schools which are oversubscribed and which offer good academic standards, the type of education that they want, uniforms, discipline and everything that the Conservative party believes in. The hon. Gentleman knows that. We are faced with these ridiculous amendments because he finds it difficult to come to terms with the idea that parents should be able to dchoose the schools that reflect their standards and values rather than be told where to go by an education authority which will plan everything for them.</span></p>
<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parents in Dundee have the right to vote in regional council elections. It is less than four years since they threw out a Tory administration for putting forward the same ideas as the Minister and his friends. Those parents decided that they did not want the measures that the Bill will now impose on them. Why does the Minister not accept the democratic vote in Dundee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because time has moved on. The hon. Gentleman is in a time warp. Education committees offer only a uniform and identical product throughout their areas. Parents and the community should be involved in running the schools so that they reflect their needs and aspirations. That is what the Bill is about.<br><br>
I am delighted to accept amendment no. 174 and I invite the Opposition not to push their amendments because they would add nothing to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I have your guidance, Mr. Martin? The Minister said that he will accept amendment No. 174 and presumably that will need the approval of the Committee. Assuming that the Committee does not accept it, will there be a spearate vote on amendment No. 37?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If amendment No. 174 is negatived, the Committee will vote on amendment No. 37.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I hope, immodestly, to persuade the Committee that amendment No. 174 in the name of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) should not be accepted. My remarks will be brief and to the point; hon. Members will appreciate that I speak with authority on this issue. I hope to persuade the Minister not on ideological grounds but on important practical grounds that amendment No. 174 should be rejected and amendment No. 37 accepted.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0301">Image</span>

Some hon. Members had much fun about who signed amendment No. 143 and who signed amendment No. 174. I am deeply concerned about special education and meeting the needs of that small section of the community in Scotland. It does our deliberations no good to play cheap political games with a serious and important subject. That applies to all hon. Members who were involved.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for conceding that clauses 16 and 28 will have to be amended to take acocunt of special educational needs. But this clause deals with special schools and the issues, although interlinked, are separate for educational purposes. The recommendation of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council is confusing because it has not made the distinction clear.<br><br>
Only 2 per cent. of Scottish schoolchildren attend special schools, as we understand them in Scotland. They deal with a wide range of handicaps—sensory, behavioural, intellectual, physical and special learning difficulties—often within a single school. Schools that provide facilities in specific areas exist but, in general, a special school tries to cater for the widest possible range of special needs within a geographic catchment area. For example, in Inverness, one such school serves the whole of the Highlands and Islands.<br><br>
If those schools are to cater for a huge geographic area, there must be clear strategic planning on how the needs are met within that school. I intervened on the Minister earlier because I was not convinced that his arguments took account of that genuine need for strategic planning. In an area such as the Highlands and Islands, on what community could a school draw to establish a board of management? It is mind-boggling to think that an opted-out special school must draw on such a huge area to try to establish a board to assess constantly the needs of the children within its catchment area.<br><br>
Much of the argument inevitably comes back to funding. The schools and the units within them are usually extremely small and share teachers with other—often mainstream—schools in the area. For example, technical or home economics teachers go to special needs schools to assist the qualified staff already there. How would a special school that has opted out of the system try to buy in such provision? Irrespective of the special funds to which the Minister referred, a board of management would be unable to buy in such facilities.<br><br>
Free transport is provided for children to travel to special schools from other areas, because most of them are day schools. Again, could an opted-out school provide that? It is vital that children with special needs are not isolated from their families. More than any other children, they need their parents' support during a difficult stage of their lives.<br><br>
Let us consider the teamwork that exists within those small schools. Nurses, doctors, pyhysiotherapists, psychologists, occupational therapists and careers officers are all available to special schools, although not specifically attached to them. If a head teacher from a special school phones and says, "I need a nurse in the school this morning", a nurse will be there. All of those facilities are available on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
call, but I doubt whether an opted-out special school could guarantee the ability to ensure that all the facilities were immediately available to the people within the school. The staff need that professional back-up service, and the Bill is unlikely to enable opted-out schools to go through a complex process to buy in that service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is making a number of points. The Bill provides that transport, for example, remains a local authority responsibility. She must regard special schools in the context of continuing local authority responsibilities for chilldren with recorded special needs and matters such as transport. Does she accept that many independent special schools work effectively with the local authorities in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's latter point. Most of those schools deal with a specific sphere of handicap—the Minister has already mentioned schools for spastics—whereas I am discussing special schools that attempt to deal with a variety of handicaps. The Minster needs to give some thought to that distinction, because the facilities to which I referred are extremely important in that context.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the record of needs. In an intervention I said that I recognised that the education authority would still be responsible for drawing up the record of needs. He said that the delivery of the provision would be through a special system of funding, but I am not convinced that I have received a full answer as to how that funding will maintain the high standards in special schools in Scotland.<br><br>
Admission policies are mentioned in clause 28. The Minister might be contemplating amending this issue in the light of earlier statements from the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and me. If the Bill takes us towards a fixed admissions policy, it will restrict the choice available to parents of children with special needs. At the moment, those parents can shop around. They are not obliged to put a child in a particular school. Children are no longer categorised or labelled.<br><br>
When the parents and professionals have drawn up the record of need, there is the facility to examine the alternatives. That facility goes so far as offer the opportunity of trial periods at schools. The child may not settle, or the parents may not be happy with the provision or the professionals may feel that there is a better alternative elsewhere. If special schools opt out and operate a fixed admissions policy, the choice will be severely restricted which would be against the wishes of all members of the Committee. If any children need that freedom of choice it is those who attend special schools —<i>[Interruption.]</i> I wish that Conservative Members would listen instead of chatting, particularly the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, who has tabled amendment No. 174 for political rather than sound educational reasons. I listened to the speeches of Conservative Members but was not convinced that the sentiment and reasoning behind the tabling of the amendment were worthy of the respect of Opposition Members who genuinely care about such children.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
We must remember that at the moment there is a great deal of interchange between special schools and other schools in their vicinity. For example, a child might attend a special school for only two or three mornings of afternoons a week and attend a mainstream school—I use that phrase for want of a better one—for the rest of his education. That enables a child with a particular learning or behavioural difficulty to benefit from the facilities of a special school and come to grips with his difficulty while at the same time benefiting from all the other subjects available at his local school. Likewise, a child who attends a special school more or less full-time might have the opportunity to attend the local community school for particular subjects. I know one child who attends a special school who is currently undertaking an O-grade in geography at the local high school. Such exchanges are part of the existing special education system in Scotland. The opting out of special schools will not allow free exchanges to continue because the funding and buying in of facilities would be so complex that the board of management would become confused, to the detriment of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, as the hon. Lady suggested, children with special educational needs attended the local school which was self-governing, what chance would they have of receiving the extra resources that they need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole issue of funding and resources is the nub of the argument. The ideas being propounded on opting out show the complexity of buying in facilities or having access to facilities elsewhere. That is a key example of the difficulties involved in taking full account of the needs of such children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We listen to the hon. Lady with great care because of her experience in and knowledge of this matter. She seemed to endorse the argument of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) and suggested that if a school is self-governing, it will somehow present a less acceptable choice. Will she confirm from her own experience that although many parents would like to send their children to schools which are voluntarily run, they often find that the placement is made in the local authority provision, which they may feel to be inappropriate for their children? Self-governing status would enable there to be diversity in the system and it appears that many parents would like that.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is picking up on some of the issues in the SPTC's recommendations relating to how some parents do not necessarily find the special provision in schools suited to their children's needs. I agree with that sentiment. Again, we come back to resourcing. To offer special educational facilities in state secondary or primary schools, we need qualified teachers, equipment, and so on. Some parents in my constituency are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
concerned about the lack of resourcing. They believe that the schools are doing their best under very difficult circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us leave aside the argument about resources, because we could argue all night and, I dare say, not agree. There are different attitudes towards different types of education. When I visited the Peto Institute in Hungary, one of the things that struck me was the number of Scottish parents who spoke of a professional antipathy in this country towards the conductive education methodology. That meant that they could not get the type of education here which had been so successful for their children. Is it not conceivable that a self-governing school might break away to put more emphasis on an approach that was not fashionable or mainstream?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has picked a specific issue. He knows that in my constituency, the Buddy Bear organisation has been very active regarding the Peto Institute. I had a letter this week from an organisation in Wales pointing out that it was wrong to say that conductive education was not available in the United Kingdom, because there is an institute which offers it. I did not know that and was interested to hear it. Of course, such specific problems also involve the Health Service. I am talking essentially about the education services, but I accept that there will always be arguments about the best form of "treatment" for such children.<br><br>
We must understand the emotional needs of the parents, as well as the physical and educational needs of the child. Perhaps we should offer more time to counsel such parents and to discuss the realities of their problems and which way forward is the best. Far be it from me to decry parents wishing the best for their children in very difficult circumstances. We are all a bit at fault because we do not offer the counselling and range of facilities that we should like to see in an ideal world.<br><br>
I return to the people who work in these schools. It costs about £18,000 to train teachers who decide to take a diploma in special education. That is a major investment, because it follows upon investment in previous educational qualifications. There are very few places available for special education training. At present—I come back to strategic planning—the places are allocated by local authorities to the teachers who want this qualification, taking account of the balance in the whole area. There is no point in a local authority training five teachers to deal with children who have a visual handicap when the more immediate need in the area may be for teachers of children with hearing impairments. They try to take a balanced view of the needs of the community. That is the strategic planning to which I referred earlier.<br><br>
How does an opted-out school ensure that its views are considered so that a balance can be achieved and how would they expect to contribute to training such teachers?<br><br>
I do not believe in taking up much of the Committee's time and prefer to speak about issues on which I feel strongly. Therefore, in conclusion, I remind hon. Members of the words of the significant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
Warnock report which dealt with children with special needs. The key phrase of that report was "Parents are partners". That partnership is nowhere more clearly defined than in special schools.<br><br>
When a child is diagnosed early as having a difficulty, a home visitor will visit that child from when it is one year old. The record of need is built up from then and links are established between the parents, family and school. That system ensures that those links are effective. By allowing parents at special schools to opt out, we are denying them the continuation of those links. More significantly, we are restricting the choice available to them. There are only a few special schools. If one opts out, the choice for many parents will be restricted.<br><br>
I am sure that the Government do not intend to restrict choice, and I hope that they will reconsider the implications of amendment No. 174 in the light of my arguments and those put forward by organisations such as the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped. Such organisations may not have responded as quickly as we had hoped to this Bill, but they are small, expert organisations and are now making comments on the legislation. It would be helpful to all those in Scotland who are worried about special schools for the Committee to reject amendment No. 174. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear".] If the Minister is not prepared to accept amendment No. 37, we could reconsider the matter on Report, especially as the Minister has given a clear commitment to talk to experts in this field in relation to clauses 16 and 28. I suggest that he includes this part of clause 13 in his discussions.<br><br>
I speak sincerely and genuinely from the heart on this subject, not on an ideological basis. I simply wish to ensure that special education is not diminished by anything that we do in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) is absolutely honourable so far as the amendment is concerned. I presume that she would have made exactly the same speech had the debate not been on amendment No. 174, but on amendment No. 143 in the name of the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I am sure that the Committee agrees that she, at least, is entirely consistent in her views and we fully recognise her important experience in this area.<br><br>
It was a cheek for Opposition Members to shout "Hear, hear" in response to the hon. Lady's call to the Committee to reject amendment No. 174, because their names appeared on exactly the same amendment which was tabled in Committee right up until 4 April.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for the moment. The Opposition should offer some explanation. I know that the hon. Member for Moray will disagree with me, but when I related that amendment to the Bill, I was surprised to see that it was rather good. I could not find the amendment on the amendment paper last Thursday. When I went to the Clerk he was also surprised and told me that the amendment had already been tabled, but then he realised that it had been withdrawn, so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
I retabled it myself. That was the only way that we could have debated the subject and have, as it happens, an amendment that my hon. Friend will accept. So if anyone bears the responsibility of getting the amendment accepted, it is the hon. Member for Fife, Central and his hon. Friends who gave us the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are clamouring to give an explanation. Let us see whether they can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am wondering with growing impatience is when will the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) answer the serious point made by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) about the needs of children in special schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do that in a moment. The hon. Lady will regret that she ever challenged me to do so. I shall answer the hon. Lady's points specifically, but at the same time I shall deal with the genuine arguments of the hon. Member for Moray.<br><br>
We have been given no explanatation why an amendment tabled in the names of Opposition Members last week now appears under my name and the names of my hon. Friends this week. Opposition Members have made a mistake and should admit it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why I should give way until I have made it clear that Conservative Members need an explanation of the mess that the Opposition have got themselves into this afternoon. They are in a shambles and they do not like it. They are having to scurry to the Corridor to salvage some semblance of respectability in the eyes of the press. Sometimes the Opposition Front Bench is empty. We are entitled to ask what is going on.<br><br>
The Opposition's press release, which I was given last Thursday, outlined what we would be debating at a a specific time last Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman should deal with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it helps to terminate the puerile behaviour of Conservative Members, may I speak as a humble Back-Bench Member? My name was on the amendment, but had it been selected I, for one, would never have voted for it. I would have accepted the comments of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). So the conclusion that hon. Members can make, perhaps rightly, is that it was a mistake to table the amendment. The Minister suggested that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0304">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
we were allowed to make mistakes. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) should deal with the crux of the matter, which is special educational needs, and stop the flannel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must insist that hon. Members refer to amendment No. 174. The amendment originally tabled by Opposition Members was withdrawn, so we must discuss amendment No. 174—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman should not contradict me. Amendment No. 174 is before the Committee and that is what we are discussing, regardless of whether it is the same as the amendment that was withdrawn by Opposition Members. Hon. Members should restrict their remarks to amendment No. 174.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not do that. It is important that we deal with the rest of the amendments. From what the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has said, there may be other amendments that he signed but which he does not support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Do I take it that the hon. Gentleman should talk to special educational needs and should not continue his waffle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would not be long before I called the hon. Gentleman to order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Martin, that every hon. Member who signed amendment No. 174—my hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), for Hexham (Mr. Amos), for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine)—intended to support it. We all knew what the amendment meant and had considered its implications. Every one of us intended to support it and I do not expect any of my hon. Friends to say that they no longer intend to do so. We support the amendment on the basis of how it will affect the legislation as well as on the arguments deployed by me.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
As I understand the proceedings of a Standing Committee, those who table an amendment want to change the legislation. Those who speak to the amendment try to persuade other members of the Committee—Opposition Members or Ministers. We do that for a purpose. We must ensure that our amendment makes sense and is accurate and we try to get our facts right. If we make a drafting error, we have the courage to say so at the beginning. If I had discovered amendment No. 174 to be technically deficient, I should have said so on a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is doing what I asked him not to do. Reference has been made to amendment No. 143. That is acceptable in passing, but to belabour the point is to digress from the amendment. I ask the hon. Gentleman to restrict his comments to amendment No. 174. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
amendment tabled by the Opposition was withdrawn, for their own good reasons, and that point has been made on several occasions. We must discuss the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I should be glad to know whether it is logically possible for the hon. Gentleman to digress from a topic when he has not attempted to discuss it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As that was a point of order for you, Mr. Martin, I shall not respond to it.<br><br>
When I mentioned accuracy, I referred to amendment No. 67. If I had issued a press release saying that I had tabled an amendment to bring into line with English legislation the effects of the Bill on primary and secondary schools with fewer than 300 pupils, but I had got that amendment wrong, I should have advised the Committee on a point of order how the amendment should have read.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked me to return to the reasons why amendment No. 174 should be accepted. I also direct my remarks to the hon. Member for Moray. Today I received a letter, written on Sunday 9 April, from Mrs. Aileen K. Lamont, who is a constituent of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). She writes from 18 Beech Avenue, Bearsden, Glasgow G61 3EX. She sent a copy of her letter to, as she describes him, "the right honourable Mr. Forsyth". I received that letter at 1 o'clock this afternoon.<br><br>
After I have read out the letter, I hope that those who might need reasons for accepting the amendment, and especially the hon. Member for Moray, will be convinced that the amendment is serious. It has not been tabled for political reasons; we understand that there is a genuine case for it.<br><br>
The letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Brown,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I understand that the 'opting-out' Committee"—</p></blockquote>
as Mrs. Lamont so eloquently describes it—
<br><blockquote><p>"will be discussing clause 13 page 6 of the Self-governing schools Bill on Tuesday."</p></blockquote>
I was immediately impressed by the fact that at least she got it right. At the Labour press conference last Wednesday it was stated that the debate would take place last Thursday. Therefore, I was immediately encouraged by the accuracy of Mrs. Lamont.<br><br>
However, the letter makes a serious point. Mrs. Lamont continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"As the parent of a child attending Glencryan Special School in Cumbernauld I am extremely disturbed to see that special schools will not be eligible to seek self-governing status and I appeal to you to try and have this amended."</p></blockquote>
So Mr. Lamont read the Bill and was not happy with my hon. Friend the Minister. At first it appeared that the hon. Member for Fife, Central was going to come to her aid. It has transpired that it is myself and my colleagues who have come to her aid.<br><br>
The letter goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a policy in Strathclyde to integrate children with special needs into main-stream education—and if the children are unable for this they should be sent to day centres. This would cause untold anguish for all the parents and the children. My own

son, who is mildly handicapped was in mainstream education but only started to progress when he was accepted by Glencryan School. At present there is a deliberate, unwritten policy being augmented whereby children are being retained in mainstream education without the necessary help. The parents are not being informed of their rights and are being brow beaten by a group of high-powered professionals. The emotional strain that parents suffer when they discover that they have a handicapped child is so great that rational thought processes are affected and one tends to accept the advice of these professional people without questioning the advantages to the children.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>At present special schools are being deprived of essential services, eg nursery nurses and speech therapists. At Glencryan we have been promised extra resources by the directorate but there is pressure against progress and a year later we are still waiting for these resources to appear despite the availability of finance."</p></blockquote>
I am glad to see the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Perhaps he will listen to what I am saying because as the Member of Parliament for the constituency in question, he should be very concerned about what Mrs. Lamont is telling me in her letter. I shall send him a copy of its so that he may make some investigations for her.<br><br>
Mrs. Lamont continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"I understand the enormous problems of becoming self-governing but the parents of our school would be gratified to have the same choice extended to other parents—a self-governing school if we feel it is to the benefit of our children.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I would be happy to supply you with any other necessary information. Yours faithfully, Aileen K. Lamont"—</p></blockquote>
a constituent of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.<br><br>
That is a reason from a parent why we should agree to amendment No. 174. Never mind the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood and I have deployed; never mind the embarrassment that the Opposition have suffered through withdrawing an amendment which we have tabled. Consider first and foremost the people in the position of Mrs. Lamont. They are the people who count and they are the reason—there is no other reason—why we have tabled the amendment and why we want it to be passed.<br><br>
I shall take a photocopy of the letter and reply to it saying that I have drawn the Committee's attention to the contents and have tabled an appropriate amendment to meet the view of Mrs. Lamont. I am delighted that I shall be able to tell her by the end of the debate that my hon. Friend the Minister was able to accept an amendment that does for her precisely what she wants to be done. I shall then be sending this letter to her Member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that there were conventions in the House that constituents' interests were normally referred to their Member of Parliament. I understand that those conventions might not matter to Conservative Members; their behaviour is sometimes disgraceful. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will give me a copy of the letter soon so that I may look into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has just said that he would.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the beast of Eastwood is out again. I am talking about standards of behaviour that are not important to Conservative Members,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give me the name an address of my constituent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave the name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not here earlier. The name does not mean much without the address, and perhaps, the hon. Gentleman will explain why the lady sent the letter to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. I shall repeat my remarks because he hon. Gentleman was not present when I started my speech. At the end of this morning's sitting, I went down to the post office to collect my post. There were some envelopes and all, but this letter and two circulars, were from my constituents. I opened the letter and asked myself the question that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden posed. Why was it addressed to me? Perhaps the lady intended to write to the hon. Gentleman to ask him to speak to the amendment. However, she could not do that because, by Sunday, she realised that the amendment was not to be put before the Committee. Therefore, perhaps she decided to write to me because I tabled amendment No. 174.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me for the lady's name and address. At the beginning of my speech I stated it, but I shall give it again. The letter was from Mrs. Aileen K. Lamont of 18 Beech Avenue, Bearsden, Glasgow G61 3EX. She even supplies her day and evening telephone numbers, so if the hon. Gentleman wants to phone to ask why she wrote to me, I am sure that she will explain. I shall observe the courtesies of the House. I have not yet replied to the letter. It was sent to me unsolicited and I shall do exactly the same as I do with all letters sent to me from the constituents of other hon. Members. I shall photocopy it and I shall explain to Mrs. Lamont that I am not her Member of Parliament and that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will, no doubt, consider the contents of her letter. For her information, I shall enclose a transcript of this afternoon's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to get involved in that dispute. I do not doubt the problems that Mrs. Lamont faces, but they refer to the issues of resources and counselling, with which I dealt earlier.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) feels strongly on the issue. Why does he believe that it is necessary to remove the powers of the Secretary of State to overloook the matter when the clause's original wording gave him powers to prescribe? Surely strategic planning requires an overall view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would argue that a parent with a handicapped child needing special education should have the same rights as other parents who do not require the fiat of the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Minister has suggested, however, that consequential amendments will be necessary.<br><br>
I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). Irrespective of whether we are dealing with special needs provision, primary or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
secondary schools, at the end of the day, as Mrs. Lamont eloquently argued, it is still worthwhile to trust parents. I am sure that if the amendment had been incorrectly drafted, my hon. Friend the Minister would have told me so that I did not plough on and did not try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. I am grateful that my hon. Friend has accepted the amendment. I shall go immediately to the photocopier to ensure that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden gets the letter from his constituent.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is where the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) rests his case, I hope that he never seeks work as a lawyer. As a defence of the Government's policy, it was incredible. A constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbriath) writes to the hon. Gentleman—he had probably not heard of her until she recently received publicity in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>—and assumes that the answer to her child's problems is for the school to opt out. What would the hon. Gentleman say if two parents wrote to him with a contrary view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Lamont did not say that. She wanted to have the choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is curious that so unaccustomed are Conservative Members to the usual Scots pronunciation of Mrs. Lamont's name that they put the stress on the second syllable instead of on the first. That shows their lack of familiarity with Scottish society, and is disturbing.<br><br>
I have had several cases in my constituency of parents who had problems because their children have special needs of one kind or another. I have taken them up with Strathclyde regional council and in every case I have found a satisfactory solution. It is illogical to conclude that the answer to such problems is for schools to opt out.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and his Friends were obviously not listening, as the Minister claimed, to the contribution of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). She detailed the problems that could arise if such a school opted out. I have a straightforward point to put to the Minister. I shall not make a long speech because I want him to fasten on this one point and not be confused by having to think about too many things. Will he include in the Bill a requirement that when a special school wants to opt out, it should spell out the consequences for the provision of special education and the back-up of supportive and professional services. That would be an important safeguard. Parents should not be required to vote for such a step in ignorance of those consequences. What guarantees are there that such back-up services would continue for the school life of the pupils involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep my remarks brief because I am a simple man, and I do not want to concentrate on the Opposition's confusion
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
because I would get even more confused. I hope that Opposition Members will think for themselves and table their own amendments and not be unduly influenced by powerful interest groups and pressure groups. I served on the Committee considering the Education Reform Act 1988 and it was depressing to see the extent to which powerful pressure groups used members of that Committee. Hon. Members should use their own ideas; that would avoid confusion because they would know what they were talking about.<br><br>
Will Opposition Members answer two questions? First, why should a school of, say, 290 pupils not be allowed to opt out, whereas a school of 305 pupils can? They might say that a line must be drawn somewhere, but why do we need a magic line? What is special about 300. Why not make the limit 350?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am also worried about the practice of drawing a line. For example, one of my constituents has been refused free prescriptions as he receives 4p more than the income support level. Does not the hon. Gentleman think that that is strange too?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is like comparing chalk with cheese. My question is genuine. What is magic about the figure of 300? If there is nothing special about it, why have such an artificial divide? The principle and practice of schools opting out depend not on the number of pupils but on the equal right of all parents to choose the type of government of their local schools. The Bill provides an enabling power. I do not mind whether no schools opt out, all schools opt out or only some schools do. All I am saying is that parents must be given the right to make their own decisions. If we do not give that enabling power to all parents, regardless of where they live, we shall legitimately be accused of being divisive. Many parents will never live in areas where the local schools have more than 300 pupils. Therefore, they will never have access to the freedom that we are extending to schools in other areas.<br><br>
Secondly, why should special schools not be allowed to opt out, especially as the right to do so will benefit them and not create disadvantages? We are not introducing bad proposals that must be restricted but good ones that should be extended as widely as possible. I listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) because of her knowledge of the matter. She presented a constructive and reasoned argument especially about the nature of the education involved in special schools and the difficulty of obtaining enough members to serve on their boards of management.<br><br>
I accept that there are disadvantages, but we must trust the judgment of those who are most involved and interested in the future of children in special schools—the parents. In any debate about whether a special school would wish to opt out, parents will take into account the drawbacks involved. They will consider the fact that not enough of them want to be on a board of management, and if so, will probably decide that they do not wish the school to opt out. Not many special schools would wish to do so, but we must give parents the right to decide.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
We must always be clear headed and remove the slight element of emotion when we discuss special schools. My experience of such schools when I was chairman of a local education committee is that whatever organisation runs them—whether a private trust or an education authority—the people involved will fight as hard as anyone else for the necessary resources, and will take as active a part in the school's future as people involved in the management of a mainstream school. It does not matter so much what the needs are, provided that those who run the schools make the necessary resources available, and fight their case as strongly as possible. In a lesser sense, all schools are special schools. Each school is different. I accept that the need is greater in special schools, but each school has a special need. Some needs might be more easily met than others by changes in resources and staffing.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray said that opting out will restrict choice. That worried me, as the whole purpose of the Bill is to widen choice. Why would giving schools the ability to opt out restrict choice, and how would it do that? Why would any special school not wish to meet its capacity and use its resources to the full? Why would local people not wish to avail themselves of the local school if that school was providing the best facilities, the best staff and the best care available for those pupils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we have heard from those on the Government Benches shows that it is time that we got on to the serious subjects, particularly special educational needs. I should like to think that we can remove the emotional aspects. A few points were made earlier today, including one about the anglicisation of education. That is a word that I have never used myself in the debate. I will never use it. I am certain of what the Government are about. They are about the destruction of public education, be that in Scotland or in England and Wales. It is quite simple. We should get beneath the veneer to find out what they are about. Anglicisation is a sideshow. The real issue is public education, which they want to destroy out of naked political belief, because it has been too successful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not suggest that we are attempting to destroy public education. We are trying to offer a wider choice, still within the public sector. That has nothing to do with destroying it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads the speeches that the Minister made in 1983 and 1987 as a humble Back Bencher—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Never humble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well he was always on the way up. There was vitriol in those speeches and he was hostile to state education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely certain which speeches the hon. Gentleman means but I suspect that one may have been in a debate where I called for precisely the kind of self-governing schools that were subsequently made possible in the Education
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
Reform Act, as they will be as a result of the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has just pointed out, that is not antipathy towards state education but the provision of more choice and variety in state education, so that those who cannot afford to pay twice for education are able to enjoy the benefits that only a narrow group of our citizens are able to achieve at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has always been hostile to public education. From what I can remember of <i>Hansard,</i> he described the Secretary of State for Education and Science as "frit", perhaps before that word became fashionable, because he was not going far enough in privatising the system. There is a logic there.<br><br>
The Minister is not on the side of the parents, certainly not those parents whose childen have special educational needs. It should be remembered that the special educational needs service covers 2 per cent. of the school population in Scotland and caters for a highly vulnerable group. If any service requires planning, it is special education. Special education should be seen as a service rather than as a collection of individual schools. The Government are destroying the special needs service. One must remember the vital role that education authorities play here. They have the qualified specialist staff and they co-ordinate transport and domestic arrangements, and supply the wide range of interdisciplinary support agencies to cater for these educational needs. I know that from my constituency, where I am presently dealing with three or four blind children who are being taken by taxi every day from the constituency to a special school in Glasgow.<br><br>
The Minister covered the special needs aspect too quickly and simply said that the local authority will still be responsible for the record of needs. If that is so, expenditure will be incurred. I know from experience that setting up a record of needs for a child involves education officers, advisers, teachers and social workers. It also involves the medical expertise of community health specialists and nurses. The concern and involvement are great but, if the Minister accepts amendment No. 174, the quality of service to children with recorded needs could be devalued.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument, which seems to be about all children with special needs, but many of those children will be in mainstream schools. He is arguing generically against self-governing status on the basis that local authorities will no longer be able to carry out their responsibilities, which will remain the same. He is not arguing against special schools becoming self-governing. If the hon. Gentleman were prepared to accept my underakings in respect of special needs provision and the position of local authorities, why is he now arguing against this amendment? I do not understand his logic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that education for special needs is a service and that the Minister is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
fragmenting it by allowing schools to opt out. Such a service needs co-ordination and must be highly-developed if it is to work. The responsibility will still be on the education authority and the expenditure will remain as high. The amendment could impair the local authority's good work.<br><br>
I forgot to mention that psychologists play an important role in many such cases. Opted out schools would also have to buy in psychological services.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) pointed out that children who attend special schools do not do so on the same basis as children who attend mainstream schools—that is, for five days a week, year after year. Moreover, if such a school opts out, its board of management would consist of parents from an extremely wide catchment area. If we are to believe the Minister, the community aspect of such schools is important, but it could not be adhered to if the school were self-governing. Its board of management could determine the admission policy, deny access to individual children and dispose of the land. Therefore, the Minister must thresh out how the board of management in such a school would be composed.<br><br>
I am presently involved in the amalgamation, in my constituency, of two schools that are attended by severely and profoundly mentally-handicapped children. Before I was introduced to the parents and told about the problems, I did not realise the extent of the problems involved in such an amalgamation. In the same way, the Minister has glibly accepted the amendment without realising the nature of provision, and the involvement required for the provision of special needs education. Will he reconsider the matter and consult the appropriate people to find out the complexity that lies behind such provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few months ago, I read in a Sunday newspaper an article that analysed the state of the Labour party. It was a fairly gloomy assesment, as those tend to be, but it then suggested that there were hopeful signs and the writer turned his attention to the 1987 Labour intake of new Members. He said that that intake was of "above average quality" and that there was a special ground for hope about the exceptional quality of the new Scottish intake for 1987. When I learnt that fate, the Whips, the Committee of Selection and other forces had decreed that I should be a member of the Committee, I looked forward, with interest, to the experience of meeting in combat that new Labour intake with all its qualities. When reading the list of names, I saw, "McLeish, Macdonald, Galbraith, Fyfe, Dunnachie, McFall and McAllion"—a fine body of men and women—I prepared myself for the power of argument and strength of intellect that was to come.<br><br>
We started on a pretty poor note. I remember the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) many hours ago when the Committee started.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I like to give hon. Members some lead-in time, but we must get to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a preamble, and all the best and most relevant speeches begin with a preamble. I am about to move in to the essence of the matter.<br><br>
My confidence in the quality of the Opposition's arguments and their performance was first dented about 40 or 50 Committee hours ago when my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle asked the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) the same question three times but received no answer but a baffled glare of fear and confusion. Since then, my high expectations have shown to be completely false. My illusions about the quality of the new Scottish Labour intake have finally been devasted today.<br><br>
It has been devastating to witness the Opposition tabling amendment No. 143 at the same time as amendments Nos. 37 and 97, which are diametrically opposed to amendment No. 143. When they eventually discovered that they withdrew it, but the confusion lingers.<br><br>
The opponent who is worthy of us is the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). She reminded us that this group of amendments refers to very important issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is surprising that the hon. Gentleman has discovered that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has not had a very good afternoon and had better keep himself to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does my hon. Friend know that? The hon. Gentleman has not been here. We do not know whether he has had a good afternoon or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To judge from the brief moments that he was here, I speculate that he had a very rough time indeed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray made two arguments that appear strong but which, on further examination, are less compelling. She argued that if special schools were to opt out two things would happen. First, they would not have access to the back-up services that they currently receive. Secondly, the opportunities for interchange between pupils at special and mainstream schools would diminish. I disagree. Why should it not be possible to continue to give opted-out schools the same back-up resources? Education authorities should be prepared to give those schools precisely the same resources. Although local authorities may want to be dogs in the chamber and sulk because a school has opted out, they should be compelled by legislation to give it the same resources as before. Similarly, there is no reason why an interchange of pupils should not continue between opted-out schools and those that remain under education authority control. The outlook of many Opposition Members has been soured. Their hostility to opting out is such that they assume that children with special needs will be treated as pariahs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
and that a type of apartheid or barrier will operate between them and other pupils. There is no reason why that whould be so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with due respect, but I am worried about the complexity of the arrangements to which he referred. It would stretch a board of management to ask it to accept such responsibility. I do not mean to do a disservice to the members of a board, but the issue requires a great deal of planning, as the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) said.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned the possibility of special funding, and it would be helpful to know whether adequate funding would be guaranteed to local authorities to continue the process. Why take away the Secretary of State's prescriptive powers and his responsibility for the overall strategic planning, which is so important to this vulnerable section of the community?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has raised some difficulties, but they are not insuperable. They do not go to the heart of the matter. They could be overcome and it would still be possible for a school to opt out if the parents wished. Parents of children in special schools might have special reasons for wanting a school to opt out. Because they are apart from the mainstream schools their needs might be overlooked. If parents whose children attend mainstream schools are to be given the choice to opt out, why should the parents of children with disabilities be denied that choice? Why should they be discriminated against? They might have just as much desire for a school to opt out although there would be more difficulties and complexity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not taken account of clause 28. It is possible for a board of management to set admission criteria that may deny access to some children with those problems. That is where an element of limitation of choice comes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
in. Perhaps the Minister will deal with such aspects in the amendments that he proposed to table on Report.<br><br>
We are worried about the limitation of choice, given that 2 per cent. of the population of Scottish schoolchildren are involved.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I appreciate that there are difficulties, but they are not a fundamental objection. It means that there are additional difficulties for special schools where parents wish to opt out. Those parents will have to deal with some of those special problems and legislators will have to deal with others, but they do not defeat the central premise that parents of disabled children who attend special schools should have exactly the same choice, if they want it, to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are probably expecting events to take place elsewhere, Mr. Martin, that may interrupt what I am about to say.<br><br>
This has not been a particularly good day for Labour Front-Bench spokesmen. We have seen the many different faces of the Labour party and have discovered a novel tactic—tabling amendments so that Opposition Members can speak against them and then tabling other amendments that contradict what the previous amendments purported to do. It is novel and interesting and I have not come across it before in the Committees with which I have been involved over the past 10 years. But nothing surprises us in the House: no one is perfect and mistakes can, and will, be made.<br><br>
I have five badly damaged vertebrae, as a result of a flying accident. That was a mistake, and I acknowledge that. We are all capable of making errors of judgment.</span></p>
