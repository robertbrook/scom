	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[continuation from col. 766]</p>
	<p>9.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? Before the sitting was suspended, I was about to intervene and refer to his comments on George Leslie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having read carefully George Leslie's book, does the hon. Gentleman agree that self-governing schools were the norm in Scotland during the period between 1740 and 1906? Furthermore, he will be aware that, in 1818, the General Assembly noted that there were twice as many entirely privately unendowed schools with twice as many pupils as parochial schools. Therefore, if the hon. Gentleman were about to treat us to a history lesson, I hope that he will cover the entire period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how Mr. Leslie's book covers the year 1906 as it was published in 1834. The hon . Gentleman is right. There was a growth in what might be called, in modern parlance, the opted-out sector and, in Leslie's terms, the voluntary sector. Leslie's point was that that growth coincided with a decline in the standards of Scottish education. That was his complaint, and it was why he called his book, "Scotland—a half-educated nation".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which half?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more prosperous half, according to Leslie, were getting education that was far superior to the education of the poorer half of the community. The old-style parish schools drew in people from all classes and educated them equally. In the same school room the big farmer's son was educated with the farm labourer's son. The decline of parish schools and the development of voluntary schools was the phenomenon to which he attributed the decline of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leslie complained about the loss of the moral quality—the democratic quality—of Scottish education. That is shown clearly in the quote that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
read out just before we adjourned, in which Leslie said that the rise of the new voluntary system
	<br><blockquote><p>"dissociates the different classes of society in early life; and by separating at school those who are but too apt to be altogether separated in manhood, breaks society into discordant parts".</p></blockquote>
He contrasted that development with the way in which the best elements of Scottish education had previously been organised, which had produced
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the large towns of Scotland … kindly feelings between all classes"—</p></blockquote>
greater understanding between classes—which, he said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"arose in the parish schools of Scotland".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. ALLAN STEWART 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that George Leslie was referring to a period before the industrial revolution, and that the industrial revolution substantially changed the character of Scottish schools and their development? To meet those changes, schools had to alter. That is what we are trying to do, to meet the needs of a modern, changing society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument is that in trying to meet the needs of a modern, changing society, the Government are reverting to the conditions that George Leslie criticised. When his book was published in 1834, the industrial revolution was well under way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1834?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In the 1790s and early 1800s the growth of the large urban concentrations and the developments in the weaving industry took place. That takes us rather far afield, Mr. Martin—Mr. Stewart—I apologise. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stewart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the industrial revolution had had no impact upon Scotland by the year 1834 when George Leslie published his book, I understand his worries about Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course that is not what I am saying. As anyone who has studied Scottish history would know, the industrial revolution brought dramatic changes. Previously, more than 80 per cent, of the population lived in rural areas. Following the industrial revolution and the Highland clearances, which one cannot ignore, the situation changed radically. It affected my constituency substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take a deep interest in the well-being of people who have lived in my constituency over the past 400 years. More people lived in the glens than in the towns. That changed as a result of the Highland clearances and the industrial revolution. The hon. Gentleman must realise that that had a dramatic effect on the way in which Scottish schools were run and organised. I defy his analysis that it meant a dramatic decline in standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman's earlier intervention was about. When I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
introduced the quotation before we adjourned for dinner I clearly said that the changes described by George Leslie—the increase in population and the development of urban concentrations—were the result of the industrial revolution. The old parish school system could no longer sustain the necessary provision. It did not get the money that it needed to cope with the increasing population so there was a rise in the voluntary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not fair to say that the great quality of Scottish education in the 18th century was based on the quality of the schools in the countryside, which contained a great social mix? The move to the cities produced a dramatic decline in the quality of education and opting out was the response to that decline. Academies were formed in Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Opting out revitalised Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter part of the hon. Gentleman's statement is pure nonsense. Scottish education was in a poor state for most of the 19th century because the parish school system and the tradition of the democratic intellect never recovered from the impact of the industrial revolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the intervention of the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine). Opted-out schools might have provided a superior form of education, but ordinary working-class children, however bright they might have been, did not have access to them. My father was top of the class in his Gorbals primary school. His teacher would have paid for his books to attend one of those schools but his parents could not afford to let him go. He went to work at the age of 14, and that was not the exception but the norm for working-class kids. The Minister is shaking his head, but it was true. That is one reason why I grew up hating Conservatism and anything to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. The hon. Gentleman was right that parish schools came under intolerable strain because of the industrial revolution and the increase in population in the country as well as the towns. There was no increase in public expenditure on parish schools through the rates system which was commensurate with the strain that they were under. The parish school sector was caught between the rise in population and the strain caused by the stagnation of the resources channelled into it. That led to a decline in the democratic tradition in Scottish education, which lasted throughout the 19th century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two arguments have arisen from our debate on comprehensive education. One is a moral argument about the importance of a social mix, which George Leslie mentioned. The other is about the efficiency of comprehensive education—does it do the kids justice? We argue that not only does it do the kids justice but that it is the only system that could do justice to large parts of the population.
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point was grasped by George Leslie in his seminal work. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The voluntary system in town, as well as in country … gives to those whom Providence has blessed with abundance"—</p></blockquote>
the rich—
	<br><blockquote><p>" a monopoly of the best schoolmasters for the education of their children; and leaves the poor man nothing but the dregs. It cheats the poor man, by giving him the worst article".</p></blockquote>
George Leslie correctly perceived that development in Scottish education—dividing education into two classes, undermining the democratic ethos and providing the less well-off with a poorer form of education. That is what the Bill portends. It turns the clock back to the system that the hon. Member for Ipswich welcomes, no doubt through a lack of understanding of the Scottish system. If he read Leslie's works and understood more of the history of the Scottish system, he would realise what a great success comprehensive education has been in bringing back to life old parish school traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite some statistics that show clearly the great success of comprehensive education in elevating standards of all children in Scottish schools over the past 10 or 15 years. But before doing so, which will take me on to the efficiency argument on comprehensive education, I want to finish what I have to say on the moral case for comprehensive education. It mixes children from all social classes— not only children who are on the way upwards into the middle class, but children who will never reach the middle class. They will have the experience at a formative stage of their lives of mixing with children of different backgrounds. That experience is of as much value to children in the upper and wealthier classes as it is to the children in the less well-off classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham said that he could not believe that parents would choose to exclude certain members of the community. He could not understand the motivation of parents who opt for selection and exclusion. I am puzzled why he cannot understand, although, I realise that it is difficult to understand the snob value involved in sending one's children to an exclusive school. However, that motivation undoubtedly exists. The snob value of exclusive schools has a great appeal for some categories of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham cannot simply dismiss the possiblity that in some schools parents who go for that snob value may be in a large enough majority to change the character of that school. For example, a school may have as part of its catchment area a predominantly middle-class residential area where only 20 per cent. are working class and 80 per cent. are middle-class parents. Those parents may be motivated to upgrade their school, which is almost exclusive, to an even more exclusive school. If 80 per cent. of parents vote for selective education, the 20 per cent. Who know that that will exclude their children will vote against. So there may be an overwhelming vote in favour of fundamentally changing the school's character. But even the hon. Gentleman must agree that that would be unhealthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fundamentally misunderstands the position and is thinking in stereotypes. He assumes that the 80 per cent. who are middle class will get in through a selective mechanism, but that the 20 per cent. who are working class will not. A selective system is standardised and objective. Regardless of wealth and of who one is, admission is based on ability. That gives the working class and the middle class an equal opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That misses the point that amendment No. 113 is designed specifically to meet. The 20 per cent. who are excluded because they do not meet the ability standard live in the catchment area. It is not good enough that the 20 per cent. comprising working-class pupils who are excluded because of the ability standard are then replaced by another 20 per cent. of working-class pupils from elsewhere who manage to pass the ability barrier. If the 20 per cent. in the immediate area are excluded, that is to be deplored. I hope that the hon. Member for Hexham agrees with that at least. Children in the immediate area should have priority for entering the school. A majority of parents—the 80 per cent.— should not be able to vote to change the school's character so that the 20 per cent. who live in the catchment area are excluded. 1 hope that the hon. Member for Hexham agrees that that should be avoided, but it remains a possibility in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 deals with that possibility by specifying that children in the immediate catchment area should have priority regarding admission. The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) believes that he won a concession from the Minister on that, but I am less confident than he is. Amendment No. 113 would encapsulate what he seeks to achieve. I am interested in the Minister's response to it. If he rejects that straightforward amendment, he is rejecting the principle that children from the immediate catchment area get priority when there is a contest for admission to a particular school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham also seemed to imply that it was all right for the 20 per cent. working-class pupils to be excluded from the immediate catchment area if they were replaced by 20 per cent. of high-attaining children, from working-class backgrounds, but outwith the catchment area. As George Leslie pointed out, that is not the social mix that we seek in Scottish schools. We want a social mix not of middle-class plus upwardly mobile children, but of children from different classes who, after their education is over, will go their way and remain in different classes. But they will have shared the experience of being educated together. We believe that that is precious, just as George Leslie did in 1834 and as the majority of Scottish people still do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman assume that the 80 per cent. middle-class pupils would all get into the school? The movement to abolish grammar schools was middle class because many middle-class pupils were not getting into the local grammar schools, but working-class children were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not be the 80 per cent. who get in. Not all the middle-class parents who
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
remain in the catchment area may obtain entry to the school for their children. However, it is undeniable that those from a middle-class background will have a better chance of gaining entry to a school in which admission is based on academic ability. This is a statistical fact. It is to be deplored and it is something that we should try to tackle by focusing our thoughts on overcoming the gulf that still exists. That gulf is a reality and the introduction of selection will not remove it: it will merely reinforce it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about statistical facts and reality. Would he like to consider the reality of the experience of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes? Does he think that the hon Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes came from a working-class family or that that hon. Member is middle class? I went to a secondary modern school from the age of 11 to 18. When I have pointed that fact out, very few Labour Members have described me as working class. Would the hon. Gentleman like to consider the statistical fact of my experience as a human being?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman raised that matter earlier in the Committee's history, it baffled me why he thought that that proved the case for selective admission. He is one of the individuals who would have fallen at the hurdle of selective admission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fell. It has not done me any harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would not accept the verdict passed upon his intellectual abilities by that hurdle and that he would therefore be reluctant to set up such hurdles to pass similar verdicts on children entering school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that a working-class lad who became a Tory Member of Parliament is definitely a failure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes her own point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It baffles me why the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) defends the system of admission by selection which so patently failed to assess him correctly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I argue that it did not fail in my case. If I had gone to a grammar school, there is little doubt that I should not have been able to cope. I should not have been given the special tuition that I received and should not have been in a class of 10 when I studied for my A-levels. Therefore, I should not have been able to go to university as I did directly from the secondary modern school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an amazing condemnation of grammar schools and their uniform teaching approach to all pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Specialist teaching is for slow learners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of comprehensive education is that it should aim at treating each individual according to his or her educational needs. It is a travesty to think of comprehensive education as involving a uniform approach to all pupils. On the contrary, it has to tackle the problems of the individuals—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It may not be as fully worked out as that in practice. I accept that. The problem is to try to bring all comprehensive schools up to the standards of the best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tragedy of real life is that theory does not always work in practice. In theory, Concordski should have flown as well as Concorde, but it did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Theory does not work as well as practice, and lack of resources can play a large part in practical failures in education. I did not say that it played the whole part, but the Minister cannot deny that it plays a large part in the success or failure of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with a moral argument about the notion of selective education: the idea that it can be right for 80 per cent. to vote to exclude 20 per cent. in the immediate catchment area from a particular school by making it a selective admission school. The hon. Member for Hexham at least has the courage to be open about the purpose of the Bill; it is all about selective education. He argued in favour of selective education and said that the Bill had the virtue of containing an option for parents to choose. If the Minister had more of the hon. Gentleman's openness, frankness and courage, our Committee debates might be more worthwhile, although I accept that the flak that he faces in Scotland might increase accordingly. But the idea that it is right for the 80 per cent. to exercise the choice to exclude the 20 per cent. is fallacious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is, I think, one of perception—of optimism and pessimism. I am sure that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) would say that his beer glass was half-empty; I would say that it was half-full. He is talking about excluding pupils; we are talking about including pupils from other areas in a school. He is concentrating on the negative aspects, but he should look at it the other way round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument will not do. The hon. Gentleman twists the word "choice" too much, and it simply does not wash, as I think he appreciates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because selection is about exclusion. It is a question of deliberately limiting the opportunities and choices for a certain category of parents. He says that, in a certain sense, it is an exercise of choice because the 80 per cent. make a choice about the school being selective, and that their choice is superior to that of the 20 per cent. who would like to exercise their individual choice to go
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
to that school. The hon. Gentleman elevates the right of the majority to circumscribe the choice of the minority, and he cannot deny that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odd for the hon. Member for Hexham to defend that position, because it is typical of the argument that Conservative Members advanced against the comprehensivisation of education. They said that despite the fact that the majority of Scots wanted comprehensive education, it was not right for that majority to impose its vision of schooling on a minority. Yet the hon. Gentleman now defends the case of a majority within a school that imposes its vision of that school on the minority who would otherwise be able to use that school. The hon. Gentleman's argument is inconsistent with the language of choice. It is inconsistent, too, with the arguments that his hon. Friends have advanced against the comprehensive impulse in Scottish education during the past 10 or 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would cite evidence to demonstrate that comprehensive education is morally superior, is ethically the desire of the Scottish people, and has worked. It has improved the standards for children who go through the education system. A simple way of assessing that is to consider the proportion of children going through the education system who gain qualifications such as O-grades and Highers. I cite evidence from the Centre for Educational Sociology. The statistics should be easy for the Minister's officials to verify as many of them are drawn from the Scottish Education Department's statistical bulletins. They show that the proportion of young people leaving school with O-grade and Higher awards rose steadily from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s from 65 per cent. to 77 per cent. The proportion gaining one O-grade at A to C level rose from 57 per cent. to 66 per cent. in the same period. The proportion of higher-attaining school leavers passing Highers rose in the same period from 27 per cent. to 33 per cent. That is a tale of success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman think it appropriate to link those improvements in examination passes—he told the Committee that they should not be used as a measure of success—to the success of the comprehensive system? Why does he not consider the improvements in the teaching force, the extension of the school leaving age, the additional expectations, rising living standards and other factors? The hon. Gentleman argued that resources are important; there have been considerable real increases in resources. Why does he attribute that to the comprehensive system? Is it not conceivable that, had there not been a comprehensive system, those benefits might have produced better results?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CES researchers, McPherson and Co. to be fair to them, acknowledge that it is not possible to reach the conclusion that the hon. Gentleman attributes to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. I should welcome any research to disentangle the different strands, as it is difficult to do so. By the same token, how can the Minister accuse comprehensive

	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
education of having let down Scottish schoolchildren?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am neutral on those matters—[Hon. Members: "Oh."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neutral in the sense that I would welcome diversity within the system. Opposition Members believe that they have the answer. The hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for the comprehensive system is based on the belief that it gives children from working-class backgrounds greater opportunity. Will he tell the Committee what the research that he quoted shows about the enhanced performance of children from working-class backgrounds? What has been the total benefit for those children, taking into account the fact that we have the system, plus the additional resources? My information is that it amounts to half an O-grade pass at A to C level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I use the Minister's statistics, and break them down by social class. They show a success story, and we may debate to what it is attributable. In the mid-1970s, 49 per cent. of girls whose fathers had manual jobs left school with one or more O-grades at A to C level. By the mid-1980s, that figure had risen from 49 per cent. to 64 per cent., which is an increase of 15 per cent. It might be thought that girls are a distorting category because of the social changes that have occurred through equal education, and so on. But the success rate at O-grade, A to C level, of boys from a manual background rose from 48 per cent. in the mid-1970s to 57 per cent. in the mid-1980s. Again, that is a marked improvement in the success of those children, and it is undeniably greater among children from a manual background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main conclusion of the research by Andrew McPherson, on which the hon. Gentleman lays so much stress, is that comprehensive education has been a succes. Taking into account all the factors that I mentioned—my school leaving age, additional resources, improvements in teaching, and so on—the main conclusion is that there has been a reduction of roughly half an O-grade award in the gap between pupils from middle-class backgrounds and those from working-class backgrounds. But, in absolute terms, the gap in achievement remains large at the equivalent of three to four O-grades. By any standard, I do not know how the hon. Gentleman can claim that that is a great success. I do not accept his argument that it is a class-based matter. He has chosen to argue that case on the basis of research that does not support his view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure, but perhaps the Minister has in mind research that compares differences in educational attainment between regions, which shows a differentiation of such an order of magnitude. How could he possibly deny that the proportion of children who leave school with O-grades and Highers has increased by the dramatic amount evidenced by the figures that I cited? Those figures are available from his own Department. How could the Minister not call that a considerable success? The figures show marked increases in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
proportion of children leaving school with O-grades and Highers. He could explain that as not being a success only by arguing that the quality of O-grades and Highers has fallen. But I hope that he would not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman comment on this success:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recent research by the Centre for Educational Sociology at Edinburgh University, shows that … For those achieving Higher Grade passes"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have explained before to the hon. Member that he should not read out items in an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall think of something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures show that such success has much to do with the comprehensive system at work. The increases in achievement among children from a manual background are much greater than those among children from a non-manual background. Nevertheless, there has been an increase in the latter. For example, for those from non-manual backgrounds, achievement at O-grades from A to C level has increased from 83 to 89 per cent. for girls and from 82 to 87 per cent. for boys. The increases are smaller but, nevertheless, they are increases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by that argument. It seems wholly contradictory to the earlier arguments, especially those of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), who has said consistently that if there are improvements or declines in standards of attainment, it is all to do with the social, cultural and economic environment. Hon. Members cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nonsense to say that we are not defending the principle of comprehensive education. Have we not said that we believe that the system has played a large part in the improvement in Scottish children's educational performance in recent years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman has studied the research, he will see that the difference is half an O-grade. An interesting aspect of the same research is that, as regards the performance of the denominational schools, a comparison of the average pseudo-pupil whom they generate in research—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pseudo?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is how they are described in the research, which I thought the hon. Gentleman had studied. It was found that, in Catholic schools, the difference in performance is equivalent to two O-grade passes as opposed to half an O-grade pass. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
difference between comprehensive schools' performance is almost eight times as high as what is being claimed demonstrates the success of the comprehensive system. The hon. Gentleman has little to crow about in terms of the research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would classify denominational schools as comprehensive schools in the sense that they are not selective. My defence is not of a local education authority versus a non-local education authority. My argument throughout has been against the introduction of selective admission. The Minister's citing the example of denominational schools does not wash with me. I accept that they have a high standard of performance, which I welcome. The lesson that I draw from that is the need to consider their success and to try to combine it with the comprehensive principle and apply it across the range of comprehensive school provision. The essential point is that selective admission has not been necessary for denominational schools to achieve their considerable success. Even the Minister now acknowledges that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepts our amendments, which would remove the possibility of selective admission on the basis of general academic ability, and gives the Committee proper guarantees about the place of children's special educational needs, I shall find the Bill an administrative nuisance perhaps, but I shall not see it as the dagger held at Scottish education which it is now. I shall be willing to debate it on a much more give-and-take basis if the Minister removes those elements which contain the potential for selective admission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not defending a system of centralised or local authority control but the principle of comprehensive education. Citing the case of denominational schools will not make us reject that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is further evidence to suggest that it is in large part due to comprehensive education that Scottish schools have done so well during the past 10 to 15 years. It is a comparison with a country in which the comprehensive principle did not really take hold. The ethos differed. Scotland is a country where the comprehensive system really took root and was accepted by the people and worked at by teachers. Its success has been considerable when compared with England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that the hon. Gentleman believes that the comprehensive principle was not accepted in England to the same extent as in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that it has not been accepted as fully in England as in Scotland. Therein lies the problem with English education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite a startling statistic. The proportion of children in Scotland who choose to stay in full-time education has risen steadily during the past 10 or 15 years. More important in terms of the debate, in the mid-1980s, the proportion of 46 per cent. in Scotland who stay on is considerably higher than in England and Wales, where 42 per cent. stay on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one reason why the figure for Scotland may be different from that for England is the fact that, prior to the Scottish changes, there were secondary schools and senior secondary schools, and a pupil who reached the second or third year at secondary school and who was judged to have certain academic ability in a range of lessons was automatically offered the opportunity to go to a senior secondary school? The only requirement was parental support. Children who failed the qualifying examination were later given the chance of direct access without further examinations, based on their results in junior secondary school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but it does not meet my central argument that there has been a considerable improvement in the achievement of Scottish school children in obtaining O-grades and Highers during the past 10 or 12 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the improvement cannot be attributed to comprehensive education alone. No doubt the other factors that he described also played an important part, but we must think carefully before undermining any elements in a success story, one of which is certainly comprehensive education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that we cannot let the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) get away with his intervention on the ability to move from junior secondaries to senior secondaries. Once pupils went to a junior secondary it was rare for them to move to a senior secondary. The vast majority of pupils who went to a junior secondary were there to fail. From time to time there were examples of transfers, but they were highly unusual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. When the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) made his remark there was an interjection from my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) that I would have used in my own speech if I had understood what he said. I now realise that he was saying "a rarity".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) described the rare occasions on which a child at junior secondary had the opportunity to move to senior secondary. Has the Minister any figures, or can he speculate on, how many children with the ability to transfer were offered the opportunity to do so but turned it down because of social pressures to stay with their pals in junior secondary school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children often regarded senior secondary not as the better school but as the snob school where the toffs went. They believed that it was not for the likes of them. They stayed with their slightly less able pals in junior secondary school and turned down the educational chance for understandable reasons. They were young and immature and did not realise what an opportunity they were being offered. That must have happened to thousands of children, but the Government do not care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. For the interest of English members of the Committee, I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
cite an example of the superior success of Scottish education in which the comprehensive ethos, which has been developed to a much more marked degree in Scotland, must play a role. In England, 15 per cent. of school leavers obtained two or more A levels and so qualified for university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comparison of performance in England and Scotland. Given his enthusiasm for the comprehensive system, has he made a comparison between Scotland and Northern Ireland and seen the relative performance in examinations in those two countries? The comprehensive system was not introduced in Northern Ireland and I believe that he will find that the lead in performance which Scotland had over the Province was not maintained during that period. Perhaps he will talk about that aspect in the context of his tour round the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister is still defining denominational schools as non-comprehensive. If he is prepared to produce statistics which show that a selective admission system of education in Northern Ireland produced better percentages than these, I shall be interested in hearing about them. I should also be quite amazed if he were able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State did not allow me to finish my comparison between England and Scotland. In England, 15 per cent. of school leavers get qualifications to go to university while in Scotland the percentage is 21 per cent. There is a massive gap between the two countries and it shows how successful Scottish education has been in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with Scottish education has been due not to the failure of the comprehensive system but to the inability of the Government to keep pace with its success in producing more qualified school leavers than the Government know what to do with. That is shown not only by the skills shortage but by the number of qualified school leavers who are able to enter university. The Minister will confirm that the proportion of qualified school leavers who can enter university has declined from 1980 to 1986. In that same period, comprehensive education increased the proportion of children who were qualified to enter university. Comprehensive education has succeeded in turning out qualified youngsters, but because of the lack of resources provided by the Government they are unable to go to university. The Government have failed to keep pace with that success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, just under half Scotland's school leavers— those with three of more Higher passes—entered university courses. By 1986, that proportion had fallen to one third. At the same time, the proportion of qualified school leavers rose from 17 per cent. in the mid-1970s to 21 per cent. in the mid-1980s. Comprehensive education has been producing children qualified to enter higher education, but only a few of them are able to obtain that higher education because of the Government's failure to invest in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We started our discussions on the amendments some hours ago. Hon. Members may not remember what they dealt with as we have had a wide-ranging debate. I was tempted to follow the hon. Member for Western Isles down the highways and byways of the history of Scottish education, but perhaps there will be a later opportunity for us to compare our views on the subject. I think that the hon. Gentleman misled the Committee and also that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) would be wise to spend a little time studying the history of Scottish education. One of its strengths has always been that able children, regardless of their background, have had access to education—since the days when John Knox drew up "The First Book of Discipline".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have spent a little more time than the Minister studying that subject, as I trained as a teacher and he did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not say that people who train as teachers are necessarily always as aware of the history of our education as the hon. Lady suggests. If they were, we would not have the EIS talking of proposals to bring in school boards, which were a feature of the Scottish education system in the last century, as a process of anglicisation. We would not hear from the hon. Lady, and from organisations such as the EIS, tales that the comprehensive system represents the Scottish tradition. As the hon. Lady will know, in 1969 it was by use of threats that education authorities would not be granted capital consents unless they introduced six-year comprehensive education, that the system was forced on in Scotland to follow the pattern that had been established for ideological reasons in England.

certain Mr. Bruce Millan said at the time that most of the discussions at that time were about.
	<br><blockquote><p>"how you would get the system operating in terms of buildings and how you would adjust pupil entry and zoning."</p></blockquote>
By 1974, 85 per cent. of Scottish secondary— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could we have silence in the Committee to allow the Minister to speak? Will the civil servants also keep their conversation down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By 1974, approximately 85 per cent. of Scottish secondary school pupils were in six-year comprehensive schools and the Scottish education system had undergone the most fundamental change in its history to conform to a uniform system of comprehensive education. That major change was brought about by the Labour party, which will no doubt defend that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this chatter about the Scottish tradition was smashed by the Labour party in 1969. Despite the valiant efforts of the hon. Member for Western Isles, the period since then has been one of substantial investment in education under a Conservative Government. While listening to the hon. Gentleman's speech, we heard all about the achievements, but how that stacks up with what he says in his constituency about Tory cuts and underinvestment in education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in spite of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, it is in spite of them, is it? Is it in spite of the fact that performance in Scotland is better than in England? I venture to suggest that that may be connected with the fact that we spend 25 per cent. more per pupil in Scotland than in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman struggled to pin the tail on the comprehensive system, but he failed. He found himself putting forward the CES research which did not back up his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments raises important questions about the formal proposals for a school wishing to transfer to self-governing status. Much of what must be included in the proposals is fairly formal and includes recording what the school is like at the time. The hon. Member for Maryhill did not seem to grasp that. Her speech seemed to be more appropriate to clause 28. As we have discussed regularly, the essential characteristics of the school, as defined in clause 16(4), cannot be changed at the point of opting-out of local authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real scope offered by the proposals rests in clause 16(3)(e). The school board is invited to define its proposed admissions policy, any special emphasis which is to characterise provision of education at the self-governing school and such other matters as the school board sees fit to include. The board's proposals will, if accepted by the Secretary of State, become binding on the board of management of the future self-governing school. In that sense, proposals offer a guarantee to parents and prospective parents about the nature of the school under self-government— what the school will be like and what its aims and aspirations will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
It is significant that much of the debate has centred on the problems of admission. That is an admission by the Opposition that they believe that self-governing schools will be popular, over-subscribed and will have parents clamouring to get their children into them. That admission, combined with the hope of receiving the answer to the Gainsborough question, puts the Opposition on the verge not only of endorsing the splendid proposals by Strathclyde for involvement of parents in the education system, but almost of admitting that they foresee self-governing schools being wanted by parents in Scotland. No doubt they will explain to parents in Scotland why they are resisting that so strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The admissions policy for the self-governing school will be of considerable importance to all parents and prospective parents. Any significant departure from the existing arrangements for the school is bound to affect other schools in the neighbourhood. It will therefore be of particular concern to the education authority and to the Secretary of State when considering his eventual decision. I certainly expect admissions policies almost always to include some element of preference for those living near the school. But how exactly this will be expressed will, in the first instance, be a matter for the school board in putting forward its proposals. In practice, I expect a school to be more anxious to preserve the satus quo than to make changes. The evidence is that schools vote to opt out to protect themselves against enforced changes. The discretionary elements in the format of proposals in clause 16(3)(e) will encourage the school board to define its major thoughts on the future ethos and major aspects of the operation of a school. Those might include general statements on the school's commitments to good order and discipline to a competitive or non-competitive ethos, to high expectations of all pupils in academic performance, and to aspirations about the behaviour of pupils inside and outside the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that subsection (3)(e) might include a statement that the school is committed to high academic standards and achievement. Is he suggesting that there are schools that are not so committed? What a silly thing to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously has not visited many schools recently. There are different approaches to those matters. Let us consider the variety of schools in the independent sector. Some place a greater emphasis on academic achievement while others emphasise the expressive arts, sport and so on. Parents choose the schools which they believe will be most suited to their children. We wish to see that sort of diversity and choice in the state system and the Bill will deliver that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is symptomatic of the way in which the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden thinks that he asks me to respond to such an intervention. He believes that the state system should be uniform in its characteristics and that I should be able to answer yes or no to such a question. We believe that the system should be diverse and that people should be able to match their child to the school of their choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to a school stating that it was committed to good order and discipline. Does he believe that schools would favour bad order and indiscipline? Is this a hint that he proposes to bring back corporal punishment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were within my power to do so, I certainly would. On that issue, I may get more support from some of those in the EIS than we have been able to achieve before. Having argued long and hard to get rid of corporal punishment in schools, there are many who now wish that it was still available. If the hon. Lady thinks that there are not some schools in which discipline is not given importance, I suggest that she examines the report that has been prepared for Strathclyde—the largest education authority which covers her constituency. She should talk to the teaching unions and parents. If she examines the surveys that have been carried out, she will see that there is considerable variation and anxiety about discipline in schools. When selecting schools, parents are interested in uniform, discipline and academic standards and not whether a particular approach to teaching is in vogue.

The school board may wish to offer specific commitments to developing certain areas of strength in the school's future activities—new approaches to special educational needs, sport, community service by pupils, and so on. A school board might wish to give a commitment to a clear religious ethos for the schools, stopping short of the formality of denominational status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 is probably innecessary, while amendments Nos. 165 and 166 are simply intended to preserve existing arrangements. If that is what a school board wishes to do, it will be free to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister repeat that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that amendments Nos. 165 and 166 simply preserve the existing arrangements unchanged. I beg your pardon, Mr. Martin, if I said amendment No. 133—I should have said that amendment No. 113 is probably unnecessary. Amendment No. 113 is intended to guarantee that a school keeps its existing catchment area when it becomes self governing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain what he means by "probably unnecessary"? Will he also expand on his earlier remarks that schools would "almost always" wish to give priority to children in their catchment area? What exceptions does he envisage to that general rule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever exceptions command the support of the majority of parents, to which the Secretary of State is prepared to give approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By "probably", I mean that it is likely that existing arrangements will be reflected in the proposals. That is common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) gave another excellent contribution, not the
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
same length of contribution that we have come to expect from the hon. Member for Western Isles, but much more helpful to our deliberations. The hon. Gentleman wishes us to constrain the freedom of the local board to meet the needs of parents and their local community, and he also argues that the measure is centralising. Most of the hon. Gentleman's contributions are attempts to control the room for manoeuvre by the school board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 114 would appear to be unnecessary elaboration of what is already provided for by the Bill. In particular, under clause 7 the self-governing school will have a duty to provide suitable and efficient school education for all its pupils, irrespective of any particular strengths or emphasis which the board wishes to apply. We have now considered on a number of occasions the ways in which it is already required that a self-governing school preserve provision for special educational needs. On the wishes of parents, schedule 2 places a general duty on the board of management to have regard to those wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132, proposed by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and supported by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston), offers a further opportunity to strengthen protection for special needs in the Bill. The hon. Lady's amendment does not mean what she thinks it does, but I know what she means and will be happy to oblige her. There are technical difficulties, but if the hon. Lady will seek to withdraw the amendment, I am happy to give an assurance that something on those lines will be looked at in our wider consideration of extending protection for special needs pupils. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and I are delighted with the Minister's response, but will he give us a little whiff of what those terribly clever chaps who sit near him will suggest? Will it be to take out "if any"? As a limited practitioner of the English language, I would have thought that was simple. What will he do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we took out the words "if any", I am advised by the draftsmen that it would make the drafting of the clause defective, because it would appear as if we did not foresee the possibility. So we simply need to find words that have the effect intended by the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a graduate in English, I find it difficult to understand what the Minister means. By removing "if any", which is a negative term, the clause will be more effective and positive in requiring schools to state their provision for children with special educational needs. I realise that there are technical and legalistic arguments which confound all of us in parliamentary legislation, but by removing those words we are changing the clause from a negative to a positive form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I can explain. Subsection (4) requires a factual description of the school as at the date of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
publication of the proposals. The words "if any" merely take account of the possibility that some schools publishing proposals may be making no provision for special educational needs at the time of publication. If we deleted the words "if any", it would look as though we did not perceive that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If subsection (4)(b) were amended as the hon. Lady proposes, a school board that did not make provision for special educational needs would merely need to say "none". I do not know what benefit the hon. Lady thinks would come from that. I do not want to give a commitment now, but we could consider expanding subsection (4)(b) to assist the school board in knowing how to deal with that subsection, perhaps asking whether the school provides for pupils with special educational needs and, if so, what that provision is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a great matter of principle and although dropping the words "if any" seems the obvious way to proceed, it is not a tidy way to meet the desired objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still trying with great difficulty to follow the Minister's argument. He says that if we removed "if any", a school board of management could respond "none". The inclusion of "if any" almost begs that response. We seek a requirement that every school must provide for children with special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that that is what the hon. Lady wants, but she will not get it by deleting "if any". Her point answers her own question. If she thinks that by deleting those words she is putting a duty on the board to propose provision for special needs, she has not given the matter her customary careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, because we have been so impressed by the many contributions that the hon. Lady has made on the subject—the whole Committee is in her hands on the question of special needs—I have already given a commitment that we shall consider how we can make the position in respect of the delivery of special needs more proactive than is provided for in the Bill. I promise that I shall return to the matter on Report. The deletion of "if any" would not achieve the hon. Lady's purpose. However, she is right to suggest that dropping it would be a less effective way of encouraging the boards to include special educational needs in their proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I do a Brian Walden and get at the Minister's precise meaning? The clause gives schools a choice about whether they provide for special educational needs or not. We do not want that choice to prevail. The choice, as we perceive it, should be removed, and there should be a duty on the boards to provide for such needs. If the Minister can answer in the affirmative, we shall be happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means by doing a Brian Walden. However, this morning he came up with an intelligent
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
and brave welcome for the Strathclyde proposals while his Front-Bench spokesmen sat on their hands. He seemed to be doing a Brian Walden in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a description of the social as it is. The proposal will not have to state what is planned for the future, but state the provision for children with special needs at the point where the proposal is submitted. The hon. Member for Moray is concerned about the future duties on the board of management in respect of the development of special needs education. We have debated that issue before, and it is not what amendment No. 132 is about. The amendment is a tidying-up exercise which has been identified, although probably not for the reasons that the hon. Lady envisaged when she tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are repeatedly told that what appears to be common sense is not. As the Minister is a pretty direct fellow, could he produce some Linguaphone cassettes for us which would explain what these things mean, as opposed to what we perceive them to mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his response to the hon. Member for Moray, the Minister had obviously taken note of the remarks made a long time ago by a Berlin Jew called Toholski who wrote that when we feel that we are flattering someone too much, if we multiply it by three, it will still not be enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is inviting me to repeat what I have said for a third time. I have been round this course and I see the attraction of accepting the amendment. Unfortunately, however, I am advised that doing so will produce technically defective drafting. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want us to have spent all this time in Committee producing a technically defective Bill. I shall not draw him on that because he might be tempted to respond in an unworthy way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to give a commitment that we shall deal on Report with the principle that the hon. Member for Moray is concerned about. We shall study the drafting to make it clearer, and to encourage school boards to think in those terms, which I believe is what the hon. Lady wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether these are not weasel words. The Minister has not made clear whether he will redraft the clause to refer to a duty on the boards for the future, or whether he will redraft it to describe current reality. He cannot have it both ways—it must be one or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) meant. She was talking about a duty on the school to take account of all special needs. The Minister is not making that absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing that I could say would make it absolutely clear. If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) wants a duty to be put on the board of management of a self-governing school in respect of special needs education, she should not be looking to do so in this clause, let alone this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
The clause concerns the proposals which are a description of the facilities in the school at the time. It has nothing to do with the future position or duties or matters of that kind. The hon. Lady had an opportunity to raise the matter earlier in the discussion prompted by the hon. Member for Moray and I gave an undertaking then. There was another opportunity at a later stage when I repeated the undertaking and I repeat it again on this third occasion. There are no weasel words at all. [Hon. Members: "Just the weasel."] I shall not speculate on who the weasel might be—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is getting rather noisy again. Let us just hear the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is the sense of excitement as we come to academic selection, a subject on which we have gone round the course many times in this Committee. The Opposition seem absolutely obsessed with the idea that self governing schools will want to reintroduce old-fashioned general academic selection. The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has repeated that notion at tedious length. I also see that the Labour party intends to hawk the idea around the country. In a leaflet distributed to its schools, Lothian regional education committee states that our main aim is to set about recreating a three-tier system—whatever that might mean. It claims that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Admission to this new kind of school could well be determined by a return to a selection based on academic attainment. Selection of pupils for SI in an opted-out secondary school could be based, for example, on how well pupils perform in their Primary 7 English and Mathematics tests."</p></blockquote>
What absolute rot. It is symbolic of the bankruptcy of the Opposition, in terms of their ability to argue against the Bill which we have witnessed at firsthand in Committee, that they are reduced to such scaremongering around the country. The leaflet does not say that for that to happen, the parents would first have to vote for it in a ballot and, secondly, the Secretary of State would have had to have agreed to it. Moreover, we made it absolutely clear that the results of tests in English and mathematics will be given only to the parents and will not be used to rank children in order of attainment or to determine entry to secondary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As testing in primary schools is not to be linked to some form of selection, why does the Minister intend to introduce testing in primary 7?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To see how well the children are doing in English and mathematics in primary 7 and to see what progress has been made since primary 4. If the hon. Gentleman is against the old style pass and fail examinations surely he is in favour of measuring the levels of attainment of children in primary 4 and primary 7 to see what progress they have made compared with national norms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why he is shaking his head. His own education authority tests in primary
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
1, primary 3, primary 5 and primary 7, never mind just primary 4 and primary 7. The difference is that, in Fife, the parents are not told. The teachers are told the results, but the information is not passed on to the children's homes. That will be one fundamental difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has let the cat out of the bag again by talking about some national criteria. A point that is constantly made about the Fife system is that it is excellent because it is about the child. The Minister needs to convince us that his form of national normative testing is more to do with selection and league tables than with the assessment of the child so that the education resources can be used to improve and expand the provision for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman meant to say what he has just said. He said that I would need to convince the Opposition that our system of testing was about establishing league tables and so on. Our system of tests in English and mathematics in primary 4 and primary 7 are part of a general programme of assessment across every subject. Each child will be given levels of attainment in each subject, and parents will be given information about what each child is expected to learn and the levels of attainment that they will reach. They will be able to see how their child is performing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, that matter managed to split the Labour group on Central region when the EIS representative, Mrs. Margaret Connarty, tried to persuade the education committee to abandon its long-established testing proposals. The Labour group split but was helped by the Scottish Nationalists to maintain the status quo, and everyone in Central region breathed a sigh of relief. But again, in Central region, information is not passed on to the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. I would like to return to the Strathclyde proposals, which we spent most of the morning discussing. One of their interesting features is the emphasis on looking at the level of performance and attainment of particular schools. It is difficult to imagine how one may look at levels of attainment without looking at the levels of performance of the children and teachers. When the hon. Member for Fife, Central says that I need to convince the Opposition, I do not need to convince the Opposition of anything. It seems to me that the Opposition are busily adopting our policies and claiming that they have been planning them for five years and that we have stolen their clothes. The only people that we have to convince are parents and it is because we have convinced the parents that Opposition Members are finding it so difficult to oppose the Bill. Having opposed the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 root and branch, the Opposition are now supporting school boards and are arguing in the biggest authority in Scotland that they will go further than the legislation that they opposed in this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister always talks about splitting groups. Of course, it is difficult to split
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
Conservative groups on regional councils in Scotland because there are none. However, that was not the point that I rose to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was talking about testing and said that the results would be confidential to the parents. Does he agree that it would be possible for an opted-out school to ask the parents what level of attainment their child had and to use that as a basis for selection and entrance to that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First of all, the hon. Gentleman is presupposing that the school is over-subscribed. Secondly, he is presupposing that it has a scheme of admissions which provides for that and that the parents had endorsed it and the Secretary of State had agreed it. The hon. Gentleman heard what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading. I do not know why a party which refuses to answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) about the number of schools that it expects to go for self-governing status should be looking at every possibility and arguing that that will be the norm when its general position is that no school will be interested in self-governing status. I can only assume that is an attempt by the Opposition to construct some sort of argument which they know bears no relation to reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the matter before, I challenged Opposition Members to table amendments which would deal with academic selection. I am not going to go over that again, but I mentioned music and Douglas academy and Broughton in Lothian. The hon. Member for Fife, Central may think that music is not important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the Minister was here earlier. Would he like to discuss further the question of giftedness and the criteria that we tried to establish for a more rational debate on the issue, or is it the case that the Minister heard the debate and, as usual, treats us with contempt? The issues were discussed and it would be useful in a wind-up speech if the Minister would refer to at least some of the distinctions that were made about aptitude and ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman read his amendments and understood what they meant—the Committee has discovered on many occassions that he does not—he would not be treated so brusquely. Amendment No. 146 would replace the present subsection (4)(c) with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"specifying the arrangements whereby pupils are admitted to the school; only in relation to pupils with special educational needs, may such arrangements be by reference to ability or aptitude."</p></blockquote>
Special education needs are defined in the 1980 Act and they do not include—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman made a long speech about what he called ethical giftedness. When he and his hon. Friends were challenged to explain that that meant none of them could tell us, and my advisers were equally mystified. We must therefore assume that the term is not generally known. It certainly does not fall within the
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
definition of special education needs under the 1980 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted the amendment—we shall not, of course, do so—it would preclude any form of selection based on ability for children talented in music or dance and other such especially gifted children. The hon. Member for Fife, Central says that we treat his amendments with contempt, but we treat them in the same way as I hope that he treats the Bill and the Government amendments: we look to see what they mean and listen to what he says in defence of them. In this case, again, what he has said does not stack up with what his amendment means. If we accepted amendment No. 146, self-governing schools could not have a selective intake for a proportion of children talented at music, dance, art, classics—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or maths, or physics—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or German, French, history, geography—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been round that course already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is honest; you are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know how many times I have had to ask the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) to remain within order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I thought that you had already dealt with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to describe the position of the hon. Member for Dundee, East as an argument, but if he is arguing that self-governing schools would not be able to have a selective intake for children to study classics, although in all but the very largest comprehensive schools there are great difficulties in teaching classics, I shall gladly give way to him so that he can explain to the Committee why he believes that such schools should be limited in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention classics in my list of subjects. Will the Minister respond to the subjects that I mentioned? Will he give us the simple information whether self-governing schools will be able to select academically for subjects such as geography, history, maths, physics, English, French and the rest of the range of subjects that they offer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After schools have become self-governing, if they can secure the endorsement of parents and the approval of the Secretary of State, the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes. If I were to accept the position of the hon. Gentleman and his party, schools such as Knightswood, Douglas academy and Broughton in Lothian would not be able to have a selective intake for music or dance.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East avoided the point. He wishes to introduce rigidities into the system whereas I wish to take the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and trust the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) often says that Conservative Members do not care about giving opportunities to children from poorer backgrounds. But she and her party adopt a position that would mean that children with special musical talent would have access to specialist units only if their parents could pay twice and send them to the independent sector. If we were to accept the proposition, self-governing schools could not have such a selective intake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that Conservative Members examine our arguments. I suggest that we do likewise by referring to the Second Reading debate, when the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can state categorically and without equivocation that the Bill is not designed to reintroduce selectivity".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c.625.]</p></blockquote>
Clause 16(3)(e)(i) and (ii) and that statement of the Secretary of State do not add up. There is a difference between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made the point that head teachers in secondary schools could ask parents for the results of their children's primary 7 tests. Will the Minister say, yes or no, whether that is so and whether any provision in the Bill would prevent that and thus prevent selectivity taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing can prevent any education authority having a selective intake in any of its schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not now, but under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not alter the current position. All it does is to put two hurdles in the way of self-governing schools which do not apply to education authority schools. One is the parental ballot and the other is the approval of the Secretary of State. No such hurdles are now in the way of education authority schools in Scotland. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is worried that selection would be introduced into the Scottish education system, but he believes that the vast majority of schools will not want self-governing status. He should recognise that such a decision could be taken by an education committee for all its schools without consulting the Secretary of State or the parents in a ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering the ramifications of the Bill. The Minister says that education authorities can currently take decisions on selectivity. However, they must provide comprehensive education. If I follow the Minister's logic, I conclude that when the Bill is enacted selectivity will be introduced into the Scottish education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us remove the emotional aspect of the argument. I never spoke of gangs of parents. I am considering the legal position. Education authorities have not taken the opportunity to take such decisions, but under the clause selectivity can be introduced. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible for selection to be introduced into local authority schools on the vote of the education committee. It will not be possible for selectivity to be introduced into self-governing schools on the vote of the board of management. That is the fundamental difference. It will be much harder to introduce selection into a self-governing school than into a local authority school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton said that there will be many self-governing schools and that that will bring back selection. That could happen only if large numbers of parents want to go for self-governing status, and I do not believe that that will be the case. The hon. Gentleman obviously thinks so or he would not take up the Committee's time at this hour on that point. Perhaps he needs a bogeyman to defend himself in the absence of any coherent arguments to support his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not refer again to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), which was based on an article in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> about a survey of the schools. All the evidence from south of the border shows that people are seeking self-governing status for schools either because they wish to preserve the existing characters of the schools against political incursions of the local authorities, or because they wish to take advantage of the management and financial benefits that will result from self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence that the introduction of selection is the driving force behind any of the cases that I know about south of the border. I believe that that is the same position north of the border. I can draw on evidence from nearer home. When the parents of children at Jordanhill drew up the memorandum of the company under which the school is managed, they stated—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company is established to provide"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the headmaster?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central keeps on about the headmaster of Jordanhill as if that were a criticism of the school. Jordanhill has handled a difficult problem extremely well and far more effectively than perhaps might have been possible for it to have done were it part of the local authority system—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell when I am on weak ground because the hon. Member for Fife, Central starts fidgeting and shouting, and behaving like a five-year-old. That is a sure sign that I am on weak ground. It is a little like the debate on religious education when the hon. Gentleman described religion as witchcraft. That will be something that will haunt him in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the comments about religious education, I hope that, next week, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
Minister will reply to the anxieties of the Church of Scotland about his mocking it at a meeting of the Young Conservatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I reply to the letter from the Church of Scotland, I think that it will respond positively. There are several ways in which the Church can make a positive contribution to the discussion that we shall have on religious education. That may have somewhat greater value than its views on nuclear weapons, the community charge, dampness in housing, steel or other matters for which it ran great campaigns. That campaigning experience will place the Church in a unique position to ensure that our schools respond to religious education in a way that all of us, certainly Conservative Members, wish to see. We know that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen believe that religion is witchcraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I appreciate that the hour is late and that the Minister is now wandering all over the place, but I take offence at his comment that Opposition Front Bench spokesmen said that religion is witchcraft. I certainly did not, and I expect the Minister to apologise for his remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are well aware that the hon. Gentleman did not say that. However, he may have been on one of his excursions to talk to the press when the remark was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I wish to make a simple plea. If the Minister wishes to smear Opposition Front Bench spokesmen, will he be more particular about which hon. Member he is smearing? I did not talk about religion in the context of witchcraft. Therefore, I expect the Minister to withdraw his general assertion, and be more specific in his condemnation of Opposition Front Bench spokesmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be easier if we returned to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should apologise to the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I was operating on the assumption that the Labour party Front Bench spokesmen were bound by the principle of collective responsibility that operates on the Government Front Bench. For the record, I was referring to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. If the hon. Gentleman examines the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings, he will see that clearly. In the months and years ahead, he may see it circulating in Strathkelvin and Bearsden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the fascinating subject of the memorandum of the company that was established for Jordanhill school, it states that it was established
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide a non-denominational, non-fee-paying, primary and secondary education suitable to the age, ability and aptitude of the pupils attending the school."</p></blockquote>
Its admission arrangements refer to giving priority to siblings and to applicants within a defined catchment area. Throughout the entire process of negotiation
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
and discussion with that school, there was no hint of any will to turn it into a selective school on academic grounds. That would have emerged if the hon. Gentleman was correct, but the parents did not consider it appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can help the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) with his obsession with academic selection. He has identified a real problem, but he has misdiagnosed it. The problem that education authorities must take into account is that parents want not selective schools, but schools that stretch their children. They know instinctively what researchers have shown—that the school makes a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents want their children to go to schools that get results. The average child does better in a high-achieving school than in a low-achieving one. There is good evidence also from the HMI reports that too many schools do not stretch the children adequately. Parents' fears are well grounded. Many teachers fail to set challenging and realistic targets for attainment. The more nonsense we hear from the hon. Member for Western Isles and the more woolly thinking and research produced by the CES and others, the lower will be teachers' expectations, and expectations are a key element in successful teaching and in levels of attainment in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old, selective system had its faults. The machinery of selection was not reliable enough. I accept that at age 11 or 12 a child's development cannot be predicted with sufficient confidence to determine irrevocably that he is to go to one sort of school or another. That is an anachronistic and outmoded notion that commands no support among Conservative members of the Committee. It is a technical deficiency of any selective system, which Opposition Members confuse with the bogus doctrine that one should in no way discriminate between children on grounds of academic ability, and that one should simply not test, set or stream them at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members know that individuals vary greatly in ability and needs. The job of an education system must be to identify the abilities of individuals and develop them to the full. There is ample evidence that the school system that has existed for the past 20 years has fallen short in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raised an important issue, but he cannot gloss over major criticisms of the education system without giving us the source material for his speculative comment that, over the past 20 years, Scottish schools have failed in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems incapable of understanding that when I say that there is evidence that schools are not stretching children to the full extent of their ability, that is not the same as saying that the Scottish education system has failed. I am simply saying that the Scottish education system—in the words of the sort of reports that we wish to change—"could do better". With his ideological baggage that he calls "the comprehensive system" and his half-read accounts of the CES research, the hon. Gentleman is able only to wave the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
report showing that there has been an improvement equivalent to half of one O-grade pass, while we have made available substantial additional resources, raised the school leaving age and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Minister asserts that I mentioned half an O-grade difference in attainment. If I said that, will he please tell me the source? I have not mentioned it but the Minister has mentioned it twice today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The source is the research that the hon. Gentleman has been using. I did not say that he had mentioned it. He has used the work by Andrew McPherson to justify his assertion that the comprehensive system has been a great success. I am telling him what that research shows and I do not know why he does not recognise the figure that I am citing. I assume that he received his brief from the EIS and did not bother to read the research. He should read volume 30, No. 2 spring 1988 which was quoted in one of the Labour party's recent documents. He will find in it the information that he seeks. It contains evidence to suport my proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence that parents will use self-governing schools as a means of excluding particular categories of pupils. I have already given an undertaking to my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) to protect rural areas. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State gave an undertaking on Second Reading about schools changing their characteristics under clause 28. The Opposition's claim that parents will use self-governing schools as a means of excluding certain pupils is an illusion. Parents want to ensure that the able and the less able children receive an education that stretches them to the limit of their abilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no hesitation in asking my colleagues to reject all the amendments. They would add nothing but rigidity and inflexibility, which the legislation is designed to remove from the system. The Bill will enable parents to judge and the Secretary of State to take account of wider interests in proposals that are put to him. The Opposition's fear of change stems from the fact that they have not worked out their policies. The longer that remains the case, the more they will be overtaken by events, as happened so cruelly this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall genuinely be brief, unlike the Minister. I shall direct my comments to some of the key arguments that he tried to make during the 65 minutes of his tedious contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to set the record straight. It was alleged that Labour Front-Bench spokesmen introduced the concept of witchcraft. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made a long contribution in which he said that parents should decide what denomination a self-governing school should adopt, whether it be Catholic, Moslem or Presbyterian. In a very light-hearted manner, my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) mentioned witchcraft and the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
Member for Eastwood said, "Yes, witchcraft". Someone then made a comment about the "Witches of Eastwood", but perhaps 	<i>Hansard</i> did not pick it up. I have been paying close attention to the proceedings, and no Conservative Members said "No" to an earlier amendment. Various Conservative Members have denied that, but I am sure that the tape recording will verify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman does not want to delay the Committee. I simply refer him to column 381 of the report of our proceedings. What was said is clear cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may refer me to column 381, but as I do not have the reports of our proceedings here, I can do nothing about it now. I clearly heard the hon. Member for Eastwood say "Yes" in response to the light-hearted suggestion of witchcraft. That is how the subject came into the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accused my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) of being obsessed with academic selection. We then had more than an hour of ideological baggage from the Minister on academic selection from the opposite viewpoint. The Minister wants academic selection and he spent more than an hour trying to justify its reintroduction. At one stage, he suggested that the Labour party in Lothian was putting out absolute rot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, but as the Committee did not resume until 10.30 pm and it is now 11.35 pm, during which time the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonal) gave a speech of soporific value for about half an hour, the contribution of my hon. Friend the Minister was all too short. He could not have spoken for 65 minutes—would that he had. For the sake of the record we should be clear that my hon. Friend was brief in his remarks. We should have liked to hear more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The Minister has had the attention of the Committee since we resumed at 10.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that confirmation of my suggestion that the Minister spoke for more than an hour on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that I spent some time on academic selection, but I was replying to points raised by Opposition Members, who centred their speeches on that very subject. As I gave way generously to several hon. Members and answered their questions, the hon. Gentleman cannot complain that I spoke for a considerable time. I was trying to be helpful in the usual way. the hon. Gentleman is being rather churlish in complaining about me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No one knows more than I do how long hon. Members have spoken. It would be helpful if they spoke to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not being churlish in the least. The fact that the Minister spoke for more than an hour will be of great benefit to the Labour party throughout Scotland. People will see precisely what he said during those 65 minutes. Support for the Conservatives will deteriorate further, particularly as the Minister alleged that the Labour party in Lothian had suggested that the purpose of the Bill was to reintroduce academic selection and described that as absolute rot, yet his hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) said precisely the same. Much later the Minister himself said that it would be possible to reintroduce academic selection. Although it was the Labour party in Lothian which first suggested that, it is absolutely right, and the Tories in the Committee have said it, too. That makes nonsense of the Minister's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham made the most honest and open contribution to the debate. He was honest about the purpose of the Bill and why the Government would try to defeat the amendments. The hon. Gentleman wants academic selection to be reintroduced. He wants what he calls grammar schools—we in Scotland call them the old senior secondary schools. That is the main motivation behind the opting-out clauses and self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly interested in the reference to the half-full and half-empty beer glass and how it reflected one's optimism or pessimism. I heard almost the same argument two weeks ago in Dundee, when the speaker said that one of his closest political allies always replied, if he were told that the room for a public meeting was half empty, "It's not half empty: it's half full." That speaker was Gordon McLennan, the general secretary of the Communist party of Great Britain, and his closest political ally was Michael McGahey. That is an example of Communist optimism. I am glad that the hon. Member for Hexham has followed that example and shown the sort of Communist optimism that we expect from Conservative Members on Committees such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has tried to get off the hook however he can and to pretend that the Bill will introduce choice into education in Scotland, but it does exactly the opposite. It will reduce choice, particularly for children from deprived areas who cannot benefit from the academically selective schools that it will introduce. Those children will be excluded from the schools. The Minister and other Conservative Members want schools that will say to local kids, "I am sorry, you are not getting in here, not because we are full up, but because we have imposed selective criteria as a basis for choosing academically and attracting pupils from all over the city." As children will not be able to gain entry to their local schools, they will have to go to other schools—schools of inferior status. That is what the Bill will mean and that is why we oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that able children in Scotland since the time of John Knox have always had access to education, regardless of their background. How can anyone born and brought up in Scotland believe such nonsense? The parents of my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and my parents showed academic ability at school, but were forced to leave at the age of 12 or 13 because there were no means by which they could gain access to secondary, further, or higher education. My father became a builder's labourer and had to retire at 65, unable to work any longer. He was a man of great ability, but never got an opportunity because of the state of Scottish education between the end of the first world war and today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a description of Scottish education that the Minister understands or is even aware of. That is why he is so unfit to be the Minister responsible for education in Scotland and why the Bill is so unfit to be debated by hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies. It is an insult to the Scottish people that we are sitting here at 11.40 pm debating such nonsense, which will be imposed on them against their wishes and against the interests of Scottish children. I have nothing but contempt for Conservative Members and their argument on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that one of the most recent democratic assessments of the popular vote in Scotland gave the conservative party 1.1 per cent. of the vote in Motherwell, where it managed to claim 20 out of over 1,800 votes cast?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Lady is aware that that is out of order and I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promised to be brief, and I shall be because I realise that we have covered most of the arguments. The amendments seek a commitment from the Minister that schools which opt out will make provision for special education. He has failed to give that commitment. The amendments seek another commitment that academic selection in the former senior secondary schools will not be reintroduced into Scottish education. The Minister has failed to give that commitment. The amendments also seek an assurance that self-governing schools will give priority to children living in the immediate catchment area. The Minister has failed again to give such a commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason why the amendments will be defeated and why the Bill will go through Report, Third Reading and the House of Lords is that the majority of Members of Parliament in the House of Commons are English. If it were left to the Scottish Members of Parliament, the Bill would never have seen the light of day, and that is how it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the amendment to the Committee and I hope that it will be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that members of the board of management of a self-governing school should be subject to some training. Committee Members will know of the considerable investment in training for members of school boards and of the current programme of training for head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was suggested by the Scottish Consumer Council, with which I recently had a meeting to discuss its amendments. I asked the council to come forward with ideas for a central advisory body to self-governing schools and to schools interested in moving to self-governing status. It undertook to come back to me on the matter. Such a body might be involved in the provision of training and the boards of management would have a budget that would reflect the central expenditure met by the local authority on training of its own staff.

The amendment is unnecessary, although the principle of ensuring proper arrangements for training is important. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I appreciate that the intention behind the amendment is to allow parents to change their mind. But I have two observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>12.13 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned for a Division in the House, I said that I wanted to make two points. First, the decision to apply for self-governing status is a serious one. When a school becomes self-governing it should be committed to that change for a considerable period of time. It is necessary, therefore, to concentrate minds, and that means not leaving easy get-outs for those who are undecided. Parents and school boards must make up their minds which way they want to go, and then stick with their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment is a recipe for administrative chaos. It is quite possible that, after a ballot in favour of opting out, parents on the school board may doubt the wisdom of that decision. Another ballot could immediately be organised during the period after which proposals have been published and before the Secretary of State gives his decision. The matter would again be thrown into uncertainty. If a ballot held under those circumstances led to withdrawal of the proposals, further doubts might result in another ballot to seek self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our previous sitting, we heard a great deal from the Opposition about the undesirability of frequent ballots on self-governing status, so the amendments do not seem particularly desirable, and I ask the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 10, line 27, leave out "one month" and insert "two months".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 193, in page 10, line 27, leave out "one month" and insert "three calendar months".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my colleagues that I have dumped my original long and elegant speech on the amendment. I am delighted to hear that my proposal is supported by the hon. Members for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) and their colleagues. I hope that their support will be confirmed in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes a reasonable proposition, and would extend from one month to two months the period during which people may make representations to the Secretary of State on the published proposals. The key argument for the extension is the need for people to arrange meetings. In rural areas especially, a month is a pretty short period in which to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) would go further and extend the period to three months. I hope that there is a reasonable spirit of unity on the matter. The amendment makes a modest proposal and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will look on it favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also shall be brief as I hope that my amendment—No. 193—can achieve its objective. I see no reason why we should not make a change from "one month" to "three calendar months". That is clear, simple and logical language which not even the parliamentary draftsman can turn into technical incompetence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One month is far too short a period for people to make representations to the Secretary of State. It is now more than a month since our first sitting on 14 March. Time has flown since then, showing how quickly one month can pass. The Scottish Consumer Council recommended two months. The proposal was supported by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and his colleagues, but I note to my surprise that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities recommends three months, which is perhaps a better time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Postal services frequently cause delays. Everyone remembers the problems caused by the major postal dispute. Not every parent has a lax machine on which to receive proposals from the board of management. In rural communities, a first-class letter can take as long as five days to be delivered. We must also take account of weather conditions. Communications are particularly difficult during the winter months in

	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
Many parts of Scotland. If the proposals were issued in December, parents might be unable to attend the meeting to discuss them because the roads to the hall were not clear. I am very conscious of this problem as my constituency contains the notorious Cockbridge to Tomintoul road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of compromise, I believe that two months would be an improvement although I should have preferred three months for the basic reasons that I have outlined. I shall not delay the Committee, though, and I hope that the Minister will at least bring the clause into line with clause 29(5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go as far as the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) would wish. The procedure should not be delayed unnecessarily and it is important that we rapidly reach a conclusion on self-governing status within schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is right to say that a month is cutting it a little fine. I am happy to accept amendment No. 84 and I acknowledge the hon. Lady's generosity in saying that she would be pleased if the Government did so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

so that he is aware of its views and can take full account of them prior to any decision on proposals for a self-governing school. Under clause 18, those will be the initial proposals for self-governing status, but clause 28 deals with any subsequent proposals for changes in the characteristics of a self-governing school and clause 29 with proposals for discontinuing a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three Government amendments stem from an undertaking that I gave to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) when we were considering clause 1 on Thursday 16 March. I accepted that when the Secretary of State proposed to allow a school to become self-governing he should always have available the detailed views of the Education Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When proposals for self-governing status are submitted, clause 16(2) requires the school board to forward a copy to the education authority. The authority will already know of the school's intention and should have no difficulty in letting the Secretary of State have a full statement of its views within the period of two months now allowed by clause 17(3). However, there is power in clause 18(2) for the Secretary of State to amend or modify the proposals submitted by a school board. That might be to deal with a technical defect in the school board's proposals or to meet some point of substance raised by representations on the original proposals. In any event, the Secretary of State at present need consult only the school board on such modification of the published proposals. Amendment No. 78 will ensure that the education authority is also consulted in such circumstances. It will therefore have every opportunity to let the Secretary of State know its views on the final version of the proposals under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 deal similarly with parallel circumstances: in relation to clause 28, proposals for changes in characteristics of a school, and clause 29, proposals for discontinuing a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the three amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

law. When the Secretary of State is empowered under statutory provisions to take decisions which affect the rights of others, it is established law that he must do so reasonably. In other words, he must not act in an arbitrary manner and must base any decisions that he takes on relevant, and not irrelevant, considerations. In order to demonstrate that he has acted in accordance with the law, the Secretary of State will be obliged to provide a statement of his reasons for approving or rejecting proposals for a school to become self governing. His reasons will be communicated to the school board concerned, which is the body having a direct interest in the decision in question. The amendments are not necessary and it would be undesirable, accordingly, to add such provisions to the statute book. The hon. Gentleman may therefore wish to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
