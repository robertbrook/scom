COMPENSATION IN RESPECT OF DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have several questions for the Minister. As so often happens on the Bill, matters are not as simple as they may appear. We can draw a comparison on the issue of compensation for the loss of a denominational school. The Government intend similar compensation arrangements for opted-out schools as for schools under education authority control, when the schools no longer wish to be denominational.<br><br>
How would the compensation arrangements be carried out? Section 22(4)(i) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 states that compensation would be paid to the trustees or their successors in the case of a school run by an education authority. Undoubtedly the same persons would be paid compensation in the case of an opted-out school.<br><br>
Under section 22(1)(a) and (b) of the 1980 Act, further questions arise. Paragraph (a) opens up possibilities that we had not even considered under clause 29. Previously we had only talked in terms of selling the land, but alternatively the land could be let for, say, a yearly rental or there could be an excamb. As I recall from local authority days, that means an exchange of one property for another, so that a bargain is struck on the basis of each part of the deal being of similar value. I hope that the Minister will be able to say whether the same arrangements would apply to those possibilities. If the use of the site was discontinued or a change of site made, we should like to be certain that the same arrangements would apply.<br><br>
Section 22(4) of the 1980 Act states that if an education authority says that a school is no longer needed after 10 or more years have elapsed from the time of transfer, the authority may so represent to the Secretary of State. If he agrees, the school can be discontinued. Would the same apply to an opted-out school? Would representations have to be made to the Secretary of State? Would discontinuance depend on his agreement?<br><br>
I said earlier that parents who were running an opted-out school might not even carry out that requirement. If they suddenly washed their hands of the school, I am not sure what, if anything, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1120</span>
Secretary of State could do about it. If they did not make the proper representations and he did not agree that they could discontinue the school, what could he do about it if they said, "We shall do it, anyway."?<br><br>
Such questions arise when one is dealing not with an education authority but with a voluntary body that has disagreements about major issues of policy or how to run the school. Who knows what might occur in such circumstances? It would be more difficult for the Secretary of State to exert his authority and enforce his will on a group of parents than on education authorities. Officials in education authorities would wish to act responsibly and would feel that public contumely might arise if they failed to do so. They would pay political penalties, but a group of parents whose children had completed their education might feel that they had nothing to lose by behaving in a less responsible manner.<br><br>
Section 22(4)(i) of the 1980 Act states that the education authority should pay
<br><blockquote><p>"such compensation (if any) in respect of the school or other property so transferred as may be agreed, or as may be determined, failing agreement, by an arbiter appointed by the Secretary of State upon the application of either party".</p></blockquote>
Again, that raises serious questions. If the school and its land are sold, it is easy to see where the money for compensation will come from, but let us suppose that it is not sold. If the school merely changed its characteristics—there is no cash value in that—where will the compensation money come from? If the school were let to another group or an exchange were made—excamb is the legal word—where is the compensation to come from? Those are not merely technical matters, because those to whom compensation is due would want to be certain that there was a reasonable hope of receiving compensation.<br><br>
Furthermore, we are discussing not only the value of land and buildings, but people's expectations that a school will continue as it has been. What sum can compensate for the loss of a school that has been of benefit to its pupils? Parents may feel that there has been a curious loss to the community's interests, particularly those of a particular religion. That loss is more than the cash value of the school. The parents and children involved may be put to great inconvenience if the nature of the school is changed. They may need to undertake longer journeys to find similar education. The possibilities that are not readily understood by reading clause 30 must be explored.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister has thought about the possibilities, so that he can give the Committee a satisfactory reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth) </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) will forgive me if I do not venture into matters that we shall discuss later in respect of the transfer of property and compensation.<br><br>
Clause 30 is straightforward and simple. Where an education authority originally received a denominational school on transfer from trustees, the trustees are entitled to compensation from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1121</span>
education authority, under the 1980 Act, should that school be closed or lose its denominational character.<br><br>
The clause provides that where such a school becomes self governing and subsequently closes or loses its denominational status, the trustees shall be entitled to compensation from the board of management on the same basis as they would have been had the school remained under education authority management. So the purpose of the clause is no more than to guarantee the rights of trustees in relation to a denominational school. I do not foresee any difficulties.<br><br>
Subsequent clauses cover how property is dealt with and the rules that apply when it is disposed of, or closed, or any other change of status. No doubt we can consider those matters when we come to the relevant stand part debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must protest. The Minister's reply shows that he has not listened to the points that I am making. I am well aware that it is a reflection of similar circumstances in education authority schools. The Minister has not said how the people who run an opted-out school are supposed to find the money if anything else is done with the school except sell it. Those are not problems for education authorities, with the finances that they control. It may be possible for those running opted-out schools—<i>[Interruption.]</i> What is the point in my asking the Minister questions when he is not listening? I am asking for the third time what will happen if the people in charge of an opted-out school do not have the money to pay the compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will forgive me. It is perfectly clear from the Bill that if a transfer or change of status takes place and the trustees are entitled to compensation, the compensation must come from the board. If the board does not have the funds, they must come from my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State. So there is no great difficulty.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's other questions were about the board of management's power to dispose of property. That has nothing to do with clause 30; we shall discuss it later in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where does the Bill say that the compensation will come from the Secretary of State if the board of management does not have the money? The Minister may be able to put his finger on it right away, but I must confess that I could not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Lady will recognise that the board of management is under a duty. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has powers to make grants. If the board of management is not in a position to meet its obligations on such a matter, the money would have to come from the Secretary of State. It is not necessary to write into the Bill every conceivable eventuality.</span></p>

WITHDRAWAL OF GRANT BY SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are very important amendments. They seek to involve pupil's parents in the decision-making process, which is supposed to be the Government's objective.<br><br>
Our discussion on clause 29 was unfortunately closed by the Government before the Minister had an opportunity to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown <span class='memberconstituency'> (Brigg and Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the Government closed the debate. Is it not your decision, Mr. Hogg, whether the debate is brought to an end on the application of an hon. Member?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should make such a naive observation. Whether a debate is concluded is entirely a matter for the Committee. The Whip can move the motion, but whether it is agreed is a matter not for me, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, but for the Committee, of which the hon. Gentleman happens to be a member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hogg. You are absolutely right. Does not the Committee decide, when you put the Question, whether the debate is brought to an end?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments deals with the same principle as the one that we raised in the stand part debate on clause 29. As I was saying, the Government Whip moved to close that debate before the Minister had a chance to reply to the many points that we had raised. I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate on the amendment the clause, he will speak about the principles involved.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
In clause 31, as in clause 29, we find it striking that there is no mention of the will of the parents, ballots, simple majorities, parent power or parent choice. All that we have is the discretion of the Secretary of State regarding the powers which he proposes to exercise, not in response to a parental ballot or after listening to the parents, but, according to clause 31(1), after giving notice of his intention to the board of management. If it is right for parents to be involved in deciding whether a school should remain under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1123</span>
education authority control or opt out, and if it is right that they are involved in the running of a school and have their wishes taken into account, they should also be involved in decisions about the closure, or discontinuance of a school. As in clause 29, under clause 31 parents will be excluded from having that right. They will be given only a very limited time to make their views known, but they are not told precisely what they should be making their views known about. Parents have been sidelined and excluded from involvement in a decision that will vitally affect the future of their school.<br><br>
Amendment No. 248 would require the Secretary of State to give a self-governing school's board of management notice that he wishes to cease maintaining the school, only after consultation with the parents of children at the school. That requirement should be immediately acceptable to Conservative Members because of their rhetoric about the need to consult and inform parents and take their wishes into account before embarking on any course of action or making any decision that will affect parental interests. I do not see what is exceptionable in requiring the Secretary of State to consult parents before giving notice of his intention to withdraw funds from a self-governing school. The Secretary of State should tell parents why he has come to his decision and inform them of its implications for them. He should speak to parents about the future of the school if the funds were withdrawn.<br><br>
I appreciate that the final axe does not fall for seven years. Nevertheless, the fact that the axe was poised would be enough to create massive uncertainty and rapid demoralisation among parents and staff. That would have an immediate knock-on effect on the education provided to the children. It is the purest common sense to require the Secretary of State to consult the parents of the children at the school.<br><br>
One cannot draw an exact parallel, but if an education authority acted in a way that profoundly affected children and the future provision of education, it would embark on consultation. The Government might complain about how thorough that consultation was, and they might doubt whether it was conducted with serious intent, but at least the education authority would go through the motions. This clause, as it stands, would not even require the Secretary of State to do that. Amendment No. 248 will ensure that consultation takes place.<br><br>
Amendment No. 249 adds a further subparagraph to clause 31(2)(b). It also requires the Secretary of State to consult the parents of the children at the school. Amendment No. 251 amends clause 31(4) and requires notice to be given to the parents of the grounds for objection that the Secretary of State has when deciding that a school is unsuitable to receive further funding. That is the type of information that should be made available to parents. Just because the board of management has some elected parental representatives does not mean that sufficient consultation will take place. That assumes that the representatives will genuinely reflect the parents' views and will always act in accord with them.<br><br>
That assumption ignores two important points. First, parents are a much larger body than their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1124</span>
representatives. Therefore, all their diversity of opinion and interest will not be embraced. Secondly, even elected representatives are sometimes out of step with the people whom they are supposed to represent. The board of management is not a suitable substitute for direct consultation with parents.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can accept at least one of the three amendments. Amendment No. 248 could be accepted, and amendment No. 249 would be equally suitable. They would require that parents be consulted before any mechanism were brought into operation. It would not inhibit or diminish the powers of the Secretary of State. He would still have the discretion to act as he thought best for the school or the parents, but at least beforehand he would have consulted and involved the parents in the decision-making process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I should say this, but although I am briefed to resist these amendments, I think that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has a point of substance. I do not agree with him on amendment No. 251, which would require that parents be consulted when the board of management has got into difficulty over the management of the school. That could be sensitive territory. General consultation would be impractical.<br><br>
However, the principle of amendments Nos. 248 and 249 seems to be sound. I am taken on the hop, but I do not think that either amendment is technically correct because the reference "parents of children" and "children" is incorrect. But I am happy to come back on Report with an amendment which encompasses the principle contained in amendment No. 248 and which I think the hon. Gentleman would find satisfactory.<br><br>
The argument that would be presented against the amendment, in case the hon. Gentleman is interested, is that the parents of children currently at the school would not be affected—it would affect those seven years down the line. But that argument could equally be applied to the board of management so it does not stand up. Therefore, I give him that undertaking and I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for going against his brief and being sufficiently flexible to do so. I understand the arguments that might be put against the amendments, but I agree with the Minister that it does not carry much weight. In communities where parental turnover is steady there would be continuity between one parental body and another.<br><br>
I appreciate the Minister's comments on amendment No. 251 and why he thinks that that would be going too far. I lean towards his view on that point, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'> (Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am seriously not trying to delay the Committee's proceedings, but I have some questions that I would like to ask the Minister and I wonder whether my hon. Friend would allow me to do so before he withdraws the amendment. It will take only about five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I intend to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister's assurance,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1125</span>
but before I do so my hon. Friend would like to make a contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, to the Minister and to you, Mr. Hogg, for allowing me to make some points. I am disturbed by subsection (1), which allows the Secretary of State to give the board of management notice in writing of his intention to close the school. It does not require that a reason be given, such as the school being too small or poorly managed. The Secretary of State does not have to make a case for closing the school. We are told that the provision of a seven-year period before a school can be closed is a safeguard. But that could be applied to anything. The Secretary of State for Scotland could be empowered to do anything he wants as long as he gives seven years' notice of his intentions.<br><br>
Under what circumstances will this power be used? The clause does not refer to a school that is too small or badly managed in a way that is affecting the children's education. The circumstances are not defined. I hope that the Minister will enlighten the Committee on that point.<br><br>
Under clause 7(4) the board of management has a responsibility to contact parents, but it is not necessarily required to inform parents of a closure decision under this clause.<br><br>
It is essential to ensure that parents as well as the board of management are involved in the process. We have argued consistently that there is the potential for extremists who do not represent the majority of parents to take control of boards of management. In what circumstances would the Secretary of State apply the powers given to him under clause 31(1)?</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the first question about subsection (1) I agree that the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may cease to maintain a self-governing school are difficult to imagine, but in the absence of such a provision he could simply cease to provide a grant. Clause 31(l)(a) provides some protection in the form of a seven-year notice. The most likely example that I can think of would be that of a Labour Secretary of State who might have it in for self-governing schools and wish to wreck the initiative by ceasing to provide grants. Under these provisions, he would have to give seven years' notice of his intention or introduce primary legislation to change the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
We dealt with the question of consultation when we debated clause 29. I gave a commitment to strengthen the provisions and the hon. Member for Western Isles was right to highlight that weakness in the Bill. It is not possible to do anything other than strike a balance between rights of the Secretary of State of the day to take policy decisions and those of self-governing schools to have some security. The seven-year notice on funding achieves that, but it in no way binds a future Secretary of State to operate with the approval of Parliament if he can get support by other means.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1126</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reply, but the example that he gave caused me even greater concern. He is saying that if the Secretary of State for Scotland wanted to do away with self-governing schools for political reasons he could get round the necessity of introducing primary legislation in Parliament by using this clause. Even I would regard that as unfair. A Labour Secretary of State who wished to do away with self-governing schools should be obliged to put a Bill through the House of Commons before being able to do so. If not, this power would enable a Secretary of State to do almost as he wanted as long as he gave seven years' notice, although there will be a general election in the meantime. The seven-year provision in unnecessary. The Bill should simply state the grounds on which the Secretary of State can close a school, for example, if it is too small or is badly managed. If he cannot specify the grounds, he should not be allowed to exercise such wide powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman might be on to something. I was surprised to hear him say it, but I shall consider how to strengthen the position, perhaps by stating the grounds. It would be helpful if the Opposition Front Bench spokesman could comment. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, he does not speak for the Opposition. If the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that this was the Labour party's position, it would help me in considering adjustments that we might make on Report. We are considering whether it should be possible for the Secretary of State to withhold grant without having to return to Parliament with primary legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'> (Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr, Hogg, and to the Minister for discussing timetables and procedures.<br><br>
The Minister made a fair point in accepting the merits of the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend. If the Minister takes these points away to look at I would also be happy to give further consideration to the issues that have been raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 20, line 41, leave out from "is" to end of line 43 and insert "less than 300.".<br><br>
The amendment relates to subsection (3), which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (2) above shall not apply where the Secretary of State is satisfied that as currently consituted or managed the school is unsuitable to continue as a self-governing school on either or both of the following grounds—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) that the number of pupils in attendance is too small for efficient and suitable instruction to be provided for them at reasonable cost".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has undertaken to consider an amendment to diminish the powers of the Secretary of State under subsection (1). Those powers do not apply where it is believed that the school is too small to continue to operate as a school and to provide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1127</span>
suitable education for its pupils. This is a probing amendment. We are worried about the wide powers that subsection (3)(a) gives the Secretary of State for Scotland. It is up to him to decide how many pupils have to be in attendance before it is
<br><blockquote><p>"too small for efficient and suitable instruction to be provided for them at reasonable cost".</p></blockquote>
What criteria will the Secretary of State apply to make that decision? The Minister must have some idea how small a primary or secondary school would have to be before this subsection came into force, but that is not clear from the Bill. Perhaps the Minister intends to bring in regulations at a later stage to define it for the benefit of education authorities and boards of management. At present it is a complete mystery to me.<br><br>
Some closures, where it is obvious that a school cannot be maintained and cannot provide suitable education are not resisted. But that is different from the circumstances that we have seen recently in Scotland. Many schools which parents, children, the local community, the teachers' unions and local political parties all believe to be viable are closed anyway because at some level in the local administration or in the Secretary of State's office a decision is taken that it is no longer justified for a school of that size to continue to operate.<br><br>
There has been much manipulation of education authority schools on this matter. The Minister will doubtless reply that the Secretary of State for Scotland has never closed any schools in Scotland and that he simply determines the revenue support grant that goes to education authorities and that they decide how that money is spent and whether a school should close. If the Minister makes that argument, he is not being honest with us, with the Scottish people or with himself, because he knows that whether schools stay open is determined by the resources available to education authorities. The decision is, therefore, taken out of the schools' hands.<br><br>
I watched the Tory administration in Tayside being forced by the Tory Government into closing schools against its wishes, because it did not have sufficient money to maintain them. I remember a Tory councillor who represented the area in which a primary school was being closed pretending to be sick and leaving a meeting just before the vote was taken on the school. She did not want to upset her friends in the administration by opposing their measures, but she also did not want to upset her constituents by voting to close the school. Her constituents were up in arms and demanded that the school remained open.<br><br>
It is important for the Minister to tell us what the Secretary of State's criteria will be when assessing whether this subsection should come into operation. He may then have to use powers in clause 31(1) if he could not use the powers in clause 31(3)(a). Tory Back-benchers will agree that the Minister should clarify the matter. In the document "Save our Schools" they argued that the system operates independently of parents. They moaned that parents, in consultation with their children, did not determine the type of education children received, but that it was decided by the suppliers. They thought that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1128</span>
suppliers were the teachers' unions and education authorities, but in Scotland the decisions rest with the Secretary of State for Scotland. He decides whether a school remains open according to the terms of this subsection.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell the Committee the criteria by which it would be decided for a school to close when
<br><blockquote><p>"the number of pupils in attendance is too small for efficient and suitable instruction to be provided for them at reasonable cost"?</p></blockquote>
Who will decide to close self-governing schools, because they will be under the direct control of the Secretary of State for Scotland and will be funded directly from him? A decision will have to be taken at some level in the Administration on whether schools can be left open. The board of management will not be left to make that decision; the Secretary of State will send one of his officials to the local self-governing school to say that the Secretary of State for Scotland is no longer prepared directly to fund it because 500, 400, 350, 250, 200 or 150 pupils is too small a number. We stipulated 300 pupils in the amendment to find out what criteria will be applied when the wee man or wee woman goes to the school to say that under clause (3)(a) funding is being withdrawn.<br><br>
What size do primary and secondary schools have to be before the decision is made to close them? The Minister will say that he does not want to be pinned down, but he should have some guidelines— <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) is getting upset, because there is a Division in Room 9.I am assured by my hon. Friends along the Corridor that there is nothing to worry about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'> (Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: His hair is standing on end again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: His hair is always standing on end. There is nothing to worry about—we are still here debating the real issues.<br><br>
I have made my point. I shall listen to the Minister's answer and shall not go dashing down the Corridor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend gave the reasons for the amendment. The clause could be challenged in court. A wee man or wee woman could decide that a school should be closed on the grounds that
<br><blockquote><p>"the number of pupils in attendance is too small for efficient and suitable instruction to be provided for them at reasonable cost".</p></blockquote>
If a school is threatened with closure, some groups of parents will be only too willing to challenge in court the definitions of "reasonable" and "efficient and suitable instruction". We tabled the amendment so that the Minister could give better guidance on that.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
There are other problems in the clause relating to similar definitions, which I am sure that we shall discuss in clause stand part. The parents of children in opted-out schools are likely to take up any legal challenge that could be based on such clauses. That is why the amendment is so important.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1129</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that this is a probing amendment and not a serious proposition to amend the Bill. It would mean that a school with fewer than 300 pupils would not be viable and must close. That would effectively close 80 per cent. of primary schools in Scotland. The amendment is not the best way of dealing with the problem that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) highlighted.<br><br>
The difficulty is in defining "viable". The Bill does not use the word. The criterion in the Bill is whether the number of pupils at the school is
<br><blockquote><p>"too small for efficient and suitable instruction to be provided for them at reasonable cost."</p></blockquote>
That is a good test. It is a question not just of absolute cost per head, but of whether the cost is reasonable in all the circumstances of the school. That depends on the nature of the school and where it is situated, not simply on the number of pupils on the roll. In a remote rural area, a primary school with a handful of pupils may be the most economic way of providing for those pupils. An urban school with many more pupils on the roll may nevertheless be an uneconomic way of providing them with school education.<br><br>
The Secretary of State will not allow a school to become self governing unless he considers that it is likely to be viable in the longer term, to be able to attract a reasonable number of pupils and to continue to provide for them at reasonable cost. If the school's role were to go into decline, that could result in it being considered eventually too small to be economic for the purposes of the clause. Those are the types of circumstances in which a responsible education authority considers a school as a candidate for closure, and the same types of criteria would apply for self-governing schools. On the basis of the principle of equal treatment, for which Oppositon Members have been keen to argue, that seems sensible.<br><br>
The amendment is not appropriate. I do not know whether I can help Opposition Members further, except to outline how I believe that we shall consider the question of viability. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) was anxious about that. The test is whether
<br><blockquote><p>"the number of pupils in attendance is too small for efficient and suitable instruction to be provided at reasonable cost."</p></blockquote>
We shall have to look at numbers and costs and consider how the per pupil costs for that school compare with those of similar size in similar locations. We shall look also, not only at the numbers on the roll, but at projections of numbers provided by the board of management and we shall have to take a judgment about whether they were soundly based. In doing so, we might very well wish to cross-refer with the education authority, which generally speaking will have access to comprehensive data and will also be able to tell us about its own provision and planned provision in the same area.<br><br>
We shall also have to look at the curriculum and the general range of education provision at the school. Again, we shall look at whether that curriculum was adequate in all circumstances. It stands to reason that, for instance, a small rural secondary school will not be able to provide the same range of curricular choice—at any rate at any reasonable cost—as a large
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1130</span>
urban secondary, and we should not expect it to do so.<br><br>
We must also look at the standard of attainment, in public examinations or according to other relevant measures available. Finally we have to assess what, if any, capital expenditure would be likely to be required at the school in the near future. In short, we must consider the school in the round, as an education authority would, and make a balanced judgment on that basis.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Member for Dundee, East, the Bill's drafting is correct and his amendment inappropriate. However, I shall reconsider the matter with officials in the light of his comments, as I can see what he is driving at. I think that the tests are there. They depend on the Secretary of State taking a reasonable view, and the Secretary of State is required always to be a reasonable man. If he is not, there are opportunities to challenge him. However, I shall reconsider the wording to see whether it can be improved to meet the hon. Gentleman's anxieties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. I have several more points, which I shall raise on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not said that there will be a clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better make my points now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, perhaps it would be as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well.<br><br>
I accept that the Minister seeks to be helpful and that he accepts that there should be criteria that apply when the Secretary of State for Scotland takes a decision. It is not a legitimate comparison to try to achieve equal treatment between self-governing schools and education authority schools. That fails to admit the pressures on education authorities. Not many authorities would be closing schools without being forced to do so by pressure from the Government. Therefore, it is a false comparison.<br><br>
If the Tory administration on Tayside regional council could have found any way other than closing schools, it would have chosen it, especially as we were approaching a regional council election. It had to close them because the Government forced it to, and it had to make the best of the matter and support the Government. That was a grave political mistake on its part.<br><br>
However, it would be unfair to assume that because an education authority school closed down with 200 pupils, a self-governing school with 200 pupils would also be closed down. It would be a fair comparison between the education authority and the self-governing sector, but not in terms of the parents of the children attending the school. The authority may have been forced to close the school against its wishes. It may have considered that the school was still viable and that suitable and efficient education could be provided at a reasonable cost, but because the Secretary of State for Scotland denied it the resources, it may have decided to close the school against its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1131</span>
own wishes, and the wishes of the parents and the local community. It could say that its arm was being twisted and that it was being forced into it.<br><br>
However, those matters will be discussed later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have received representations about a brief debate on clause stand part. Given the scope of the clause, that would be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have allowed a debate, Mr. Hogg, if it is brief. I shall aim to be brief, even though this is an extensive clause. It is about the withdrawal of grant by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The meat starts in clause subsection (3), which deals with the methods by which the Secretary of State can withdraw the grant, for two main reasons. We have just considered one reason, that the number of pupils was too small for efficient and proper education. In other words, the roll could have fallen to such an extent that the grant was not necessary.<br><br>
However, subsection (3)(b) states that the school could not continue on the grounds
<br><blockquote><p>"that the board of management have been guilty of substantial or persistent failure to comply, or secure compliance, with any duty imposed on them by or under this Act or any other enactment."</p></blockquote>
That is an important part of the clause because that power would have to be reserved with the Secretary of State for Scotland, to use in case the board of management did not fulfil its duties and functions under the legislation. Paragraph (b) is also open to challenge. It would be difficult to define it any better and I do not wish to push the point, but I foresee similar problems to those that arose previously, with the meaning of
<br><blockquote><p>"substantial or persistent failure to comply".</p></blockquote>
The Minister dealt with our previous worries adequately and explained how comparisons would be made with equivalent schools. He said that it would be different in rural and urban areas, and that attainment would be considered. That was a suitable solution, and I presume that a similar one could be found here.<br><br>
The clause goes on to deal with the procedures that the Secretary of State will follow when he decides to cease to maintain a self-governing school. It states the circumstances in which he could give less than the seven years' notice on which the clause is based. Again, he has agreed that there will be consultation on the various issues.<br><br>
Subsection (7) says that the Secretary of State will
<br><blockquote><p>"give notice in writing … to the board extending the time within which those measures are required to be taken; or … after consulting the education authority, give notice under subsection (1) above in respect of the school."</p></blockquote>
We are pleased that there will be consultation with the education authority. Once the Secretary of State has made his decision, he is obliged to give notice to the appropriate authorities and they are then given time in which to rectify the problems. The Secretary of State has two options: he can say either that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1132</span>
reason for withdrawing grant are irremediable or that he will give the school time to remedy the problem. During that time, there will be periods of consultation. Subsection (7) says that the Secretary of State will give notice
<br><blockquote><p>"within the period of two months beginning with the day next following the end of that time."</p></blockquote>
It is appropriate, when such decisions are being made, that self-governing schools and the parents have their rights accorded to them, irrespective of the fact that we do not like the idea of those schools.<br><br>
Further subsections deal with the procedures that are necessary when the Secretary of State is considering withdrawing grant. Subsection (10) is without prejudice to the previous subsections.<br><br>
The clause is interesting and extensive. We have tried to amend it in various ways—perhaps not always technically the best. The Minister has reassured us about consultation with parents and explained how some of the wording will be dealt with if sufficiently challenged. I await his response to the other points that we have raised, but we are happy with many of the provisions of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the clause deals with the withdrawal of grant, it throws some light on the Scottish education system that has been constructed by the Government under the Bill and previous legislation. We hear much rhetoric about giving power back to the people. The Government say that the only devolution that matters is the devolution that gives power to parents, schools and so on. That sounds good, but in reality it does not exist. It is a myth.<br><br>
The clause shows that that is so. For example, the notes on clauses state:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 31 provides for the Secretary of State ceasing to maintain a self-governing school".</p></blockquote>
It is the decision not of the parents, the children, or the community, but of the Secretary of State. The notes also say that subsection (1)
<br><blockquote><p>"provides for the Secretary of State giving written notice … that he intends to cease to maintain a self-governing school".</p></blockquote>
No one else is required to give notice of such an intention. The notes state:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsections (4) and (5) empower the Secretary of State, where he is satisfied a problem exists in terms of subsection (3)".</p></blockquote>
So if the Secretary of State is satisfied that a school is too small, or badly managed, he can issue a notice of his intention to withdraw grant.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Many arguments can be put on such a clause, but no one can argue that giving those powers to the Secretary of State is real devolution of power to the community, the parents and the children. The notes on clauses say:
<br><blockquote><p>"under 7(a), the Secretary of State may extend the period"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (8)(a) allows the Secretary of State to withdraw any notice given under this clause."</p></blockquote>
That is the flavour of the clause: it is about the powers given to the Secretary of State. Far from the clause being devolution of power, it is centralisation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1133</span>
power to the Secretary of State. That is what this Bill and the School Boards (Scotland) Act are about.<br><br>
There is a facade of devolution and of giving education back to the parents, but schools are being brought under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will fund them directly. It is on clauses such as clause 31 that we begin to realise the powers that emerge from that direct control over funding of self-governing schools. The Secretary of State will decide anything and everything. Legislation may require him to consult, to give written notice, or even to talk to parents and teachers about it, but he does not have to listen to what they say. His decision will be everything.<br><br>
That is a great contrast with the ideas that the Minister expressed when he wrote "Save our Schools" in conjunction with his hon. Friends who are now sleeping on the Back Benches. On page 9 that document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not the choices of parents in consultation with their children, which determine the type of education, and the degree of it, which they obtain. It is the decisions of the suppliers".</p></blockquote>
In the terms of the Bill, the Opposition agree with that. The supplier of direct funding is the Secretary of State for Scotland, so the very fault that the Minister and his hon. Friends complained about two years ago, they now support by endorsing clause 31. They are not leaving power with the parents and children but are devolving it away from local centres and concentrating it with the real supplier of funds— the Secretary of State. They can claim many things, but they cannot claim that this is devolution of power to the people.<br><br>
The document continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Schooling in Britain is set by the producers."</p></blockquote>
That is not true. Schooling in Britain has now been set by the Secretary of State for Scotland and by the Secretary of State for Education and Science. They call the shots; they call the tunes; they decide what will happen—and nobody else. They do that without an electoral mandate: 18 per cent. of the electorate in Scotland and 32 per cent. of the electorate in the United Kingdom voted the Conservatives into power, who are transforming the education system across the country at their whim.<br><br>
When the authors of the document were younger and not in their present posts they wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"The educational establishment decides where the schools shall be, and which ones must close."</p></blockquote>
That is reflected exactly in clause 31. The education establishment is the Secretary of State for Scotland. He decides where the school shall be and which schools must close. Conservatives can argue many things on the clause, but they cannot argue the very ideas that they complained about when "Save our Schools" was written.<br><br>
There is a certain hypocrisy in those who vote for the measures in the Bill. A few years ago, when they were not held responsible for Scottish legislation, they spoke a different language. Now they are doing something very different from what they proposed a long time ago.<br><br>
The authors went on to say:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1134</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"At very few points in the entire school system does the parent or child as consumer have any choice at all."</p></blockquote>
Nothing could be more true of clause 31; there will be very little choice for the parent as consumer. We have only to glance at the various provisions in the clause. Nowhere is there the chance for parents and children—the consumers, as they are called in "Save our Schools"—to choose whether their school can continue to exist. That will not be allowed. The Secretary of State is all-powerful and all-knowledgeable, in the Minister's perspective.<br><br>
The Bill is one of the more centralising measures to come before the House. It is one of the more centralising measures for which the Minister has been responsible. He will call it something entirely different. He calls everything something other than what it is. I often think that the Minister suffers from seeing the world, not through rose-tinted glasses, but through blue or black-tinted glasses. He does not see things as they are, but as he thinks they are in his fevered imagination.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's reasons for deciding whether a school can continue to exist—it may be too small, or may have been poorly managed—raised a whole range of questions. The Minister showed concern that a Labour Secretary of State for Scotland may be antipathetic towards self-governing schools. But what will happen when a Tory Secretary of State for Scotland does not like the way that a self-governing school is run, perhaps because it is pursuing policies that he does not like? For example, there is a tirade against peace studies and multi-cultured education in "Save our Schools". Even if the board of management of a self-governing school is progressive and pursues such policies, subsection (1) allows the Secretary of State to say, "I am not having a school teaching peace studies, talking about the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, President Gorbachev, and saying that the Soviet Union is not a threat." The Secretary of State may decide to withdraw grant from that self-governing school because he does not like what the children there are being taught. No doubt the Minister will now go back on his earlier promise to look again at the circumstances in which the subsection may be applied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to let us know whether he will stand true to his ideological position and, to the fullest of his powers, prevent schools from embarking on peace studies and similar programmes. Or will he say, "Trust the parents", as he has been saying throughout our proceedings? The Minister has painted himself into a corner. He will annoy some of his colleagues on the far Right, whatever he does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head. If we look at "Save our Schools", we see that the motivation for destroying the education authority system and replacing it with self-governing schools controlled by parents who dominate the boards of management was an objection to what was thought to be happening in schools in England. The Conservative Members behind "Save our Schools" did not want peace studies to be taught in English
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1135</span>
schools, and they thought that this system would get rid of peace studies. But instead it could give birth to a new range of schools where the teaching could go further than including peace studies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'> (Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would worry me if a small group of Left-wing motivated people tried to impose their views on a school. It would worry me if they took control of a school board. But if they tried to change the characteristics of a school, they would have to ballot the parents. I have confidence in the good sense of parents everywhere—whether in Scotland or England. That is very different from what obtains at present, where a small group of dedicated Left-wingers can take control of the Labour group in a local authority and impose their views on parents, who have no redress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The exact opposite is the case. Parents have redress in any area if they do not like what is going on in their school. They can vote in local elections. The people who are ultimately responsible for the way that the schools are run are those who are elected to the education authority. That certainly happens in Scotland, although perhaps not here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in a region such as Strathclyde, which the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has admitted is unwieldy and does not deliver the goods, parents of children at a particular school have control over education policy? They do not, because the region is too large. If a school becomes self governing, parents will have direct and intimate control over their school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point. An individual does not control a community. The democratic process gives individuals the opportunity to exert their influence by casting a vote. When an individual loses in a ballot, he should accept the result. The Minister and Conservative Members have not accepted that they have lost in Scotland, and they continually refuse to recognise the fact. The vast majority of Scottish voters do not want the Bill imposed upon them, and that is why the Opposition have spent so long arguing against clauses such as clause 31, which concentrate power with the unrepresentative Tory Secretary of State for Scotland. That is the nub of the argument.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is virtually saying that we should have no rules: we should have anarchy in which any group can do what it wishes provided that it can dominate a sufficiently small electorate. Self-governing schools will have a small electorate, and in some areas some people may be like the hon. Gentleman and be prepared to follow an extreme Right-wing approach. The Bill is about opting out of the democratic process in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Gentleman has got the pronunciation of Brigg perfect, perhaps I may refer to Sir John Nélthorpe school, the local comprehensive in Brigg. At every election for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1136</span>
local education authority in Humberside, the people of Brigg have always voted for a Conservative county councillor. However, a group of Labour politicians from Hull in north Humberside do not allow democracy in Brigg to have its way. The hon. Gentleman told my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) what should happen at the ballot box, but it does not happen in Brigg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed the debate to develop, but I must tell the hon. Members who are engaged in these exchanges that we are discussing the withdrawal of grants by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Events in north Humberside are not relevant to the clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will not be tempted to respond to that intervention and will return to the central issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, your counsel, Mr. Hogg, is wise. But may I say that there is a similar position in Scotland? An area of Fife repeatedly returns a Communist councillor, but we have yet to see a Communist regional council. I am sure that those voters are just as frustrated as the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes.<br><br>
Clause 31 gives wide powers to the Secretary of State for Scotland to intervene and withhold grants from a self-governing school. The document, "Save our Schools", to which the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes and the Minister lent their names, talks about "Unethical uses of education." I imagine that no Secretary of State would allow a self-governing school to continue if it were involved in that. I note that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is now taking an interest. He would also expect the Secretary of State for Scotland to intervene to prevent boards of management allowing unethical material to be used in school. Yet the document states that it is unethical to introduce courses in peace studies because they "cloak unilateralist propaganda". A modern studies course considering the influence that the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament may have had on Government policy may be considered to be unethical by a Tory Secretary of State. Under the powers given to him by subsection (1), he might decide to withdraw grants from the school where it is taught. I suspect that few members of the Committee would agree with that decision, but I might be wrong. The hon. Member for Tayside, North looks shocked that such a decision could be made, but other Conservative Back Benchers do not seem to rule out the possibility.<br><br>
The document also states that it is unethical to use
<br><blockquote><p>"text books on sex which actively promote gay and lesbian practices."</p></blockquote>
Many hon. Members believe that it is wrong to discriminate against those groups, but the document states that it is unethical to teach such subjects in school as part of its sex or moral education. In the era of AIDS, I am sure that we are anxious that sex education is taught in schools, but members of the Committee have included it in a chapter headed, "Unethical uses of education".</span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'> (Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about minority views—CND is a minority, however one looks at it, and I use it as an illustration simply because he mentioned it. If a board of management had a policy to cater for a minority, which the majority of parents in the school did not support, it would not continue for long because the board would be made well aware that it was not the thing to do. That is why we have every confidence in the local people doing what the majority wants. If the majority wants it, that is what should happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a strange contribution from the hon. Gentleman. His hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was careful to point out that majorities would not impose their view on self-governing schools through the board of management. He said that a group of Moslem parents would not dominate the school; they would merely wish their children's attendance at the school to be reflected in the ethos and running of the school. I do not object to that. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has come up with a strange idea that whoever happens to be in the majority can get their way. That could be Moslems, Catholics, Protestants, Jews or whoever. Whichever religious group predominates, it would impose a curriculum. Does the Secretary of State intervene at that point and say that he does not accept such behaviour from a board of management?<br><br>
The wide powers given to the Secretary of State would enable him to intervene on political grounds to withdraw grant from a self-governing school and from a board of management. The Minister may say that that is nonsense and that the Secretary of State will not do that. Who is to say that he will not do that? The Minister himself lent his name to a document which said that it was unethical to promote certain types of sex education in schools and to support peace studies. The document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A teaching pack from ILEA ('Auschwitz: Yesterday's Racism') suggests in the guide that the children should be invited to compare Hitler's mass exterminations with what is called 'anti-union' legislation in Britain."</p></blockquote>
That is probably a gross misrepresentation of that teaching pack. Everyone knows that the racism that eventually led to the gas chambers began with attacks on trade unions. That is how Hitler began. It is a valid point. If someone makes that point in a teaching pack that is made available to children, will the Secretary of State for Scotland withdraw grant? Is that what Conservative Members are saying? That is what they seem to be saying. They said that in 1986 and they come back here in 1988—no 1989. We have been a long time in this Committee. Those are general problems which worry me. I want parents to have real opportunities to express their preferences and to give effect to them.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the points that I have raised and to explain how the Secretary of State would not be able to intervene politically as I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak only briefly and ask one simple question about the clause. Under subsection (4), where the Secretary of State is satisfied
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1138</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"that the board of management have been guilty of substantial or persistent failure to comply, or secure compliance, with any duty imposed on them by or under this Act or any other enactment",</p></blockquote>
he may give the board of management notice in writing, stating the grounds on which he considers the school to be unsuitable to continue. If it is optional for the Secretary of State to give that notice, does it mean that if he thought that the board of management was guilty of the failures described in subsection (3)(b), he could turn a blind eye? If he does not have the option of turning a blind eye to the gross failures in that paragraph, when is he required to pull a board of management into line?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that last point first. When the Secretary of State considers that a board is failing in its duty, he is given power to specify remedial measures that must be taken if he is to continue to maintain the school. He is required to give the board of management a period of six months or longer to put those measures into effect. A period of such length is appropriate in dealing with a serious failure of management that would need a period of time to rectify.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is querying the use of the word, "may" and the other powers that might be available. It is not appropriate for the Secretary of State simply to turn a blind eye to those failures, and if he were to do so, he would be in some difficulty. Other powers in the Bill provide a swifter remedy, such as the power to impose specific requirements under grant regulations in clause 25(7) or to take default action under section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which applies to the board of management of a self-governing school order clause 7(7).<br><br>
It is some time since I saw the draft of "Save our Schools", but I am fairly sure that the interpretation of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) of what it says about sex education is not correct. Perhaps we can discuss that later. My hon. Friends from the No Turning Back group were worried about the promotion of homosexuality and the abuse of responsible health and sex education to put across a particular view. We consider that to be unethical.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East said that the Secretary of State's powers were a betrayal of the idea that parents and their preferences should determine funding. He is quite wrong. The Secretary of State is involved only in setting up the self-governing school or when difficulties arise. The board of management is left free of any interference from the Secretary of State in the day-to-day management of the school. Even when determining funding, the Secretary of State must refer to the local authority.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman's speech was not long enough to enable me to count the number of powers that the Secretary of State has in the Bill, but sections 1 to 47 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 bring him into play on 36 occasions—to make regulations and determine disputes. That is more than the number in clauses 1 to 47 of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a self-governing school chooses to run a peace studies course—presumably with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0644">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1139</span>
support of the parents—that is surely no reason for the Secretary of State to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Provided that the school is run properly, delivers a curriculum and satisfies the inspectorate, there would be no reason at all for the Secretary of State to intervene. If he were to intervene on that basis, possibly he could be held to be acting unreasonably. That would be for others, and not for me, to determine. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said, parents might have a view on such matters and could hold the board directly to account.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is wrong to regard the clause as a centralising measure. On the contrary, it will protect approximately public money and provide for when things go wrong. We do not expect anything to go wrong. We believe that the schools will be successful and will be supported. Resources will be determined by the preferences of parents, not by the preferences of producers, because the money will follow the child, just as it follows the patient in our White Paper proposals.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TRANSFER OF LAND, MOVEABLE PROPERTY AND OBLIGATIONS TO BOARD OF MANAGEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 22, leave out lines 43 and 44.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 252, in page 22, leave out lines 43 to 47.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point behind the amendment is simple. It asks that the liabilities and obligations to be transferred to a board of management under the clause include any obligation to repay the principal or interest of any loan incurred by the local authority for the purposes of the school that is about to become self governing.<br><br>
Without subsection (5)(a), any debts incurred by a local education authority in respect of a school that becomes self-governing would become the responsibility of that school.<br><br>
This is a straightforward point. The board of management is embarking on a course on which it is to become completely self governing to the extent of not being obliged to consult the local education authority over its day-to-day running or its capital decisions. It will be under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland, so it will not be self governing in that sense, but it will be separate from the local education authority. It is appropriate that alongside that power and freedom should go the responsibility of taking care of debts.<br><br>
There will be no objection to that in principle. After all, it would be odd to confer power and choice without any according responsibilities. The Minister might reply that this is no more than a bookkeeping
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1140</span>
exercise, and that the money will come from the Secretary of State anyway.<br><br>
We could argue that the whole process has been a bookkeeping exercise on a large scale. The principle of the running of the school has not altered, as it is still to be accountable to a second body of constituents. All we are doing is shrinking the body of constituents from the body of constituents which elects a local education authority to the constituents that elect the board of management. In that sense, there is no new principle behind the Bill, only the bookkeeping exercise of shifting power sideways.<br><br>
If that is the Government's argument, the financial responsibilities should also be shifted sideways. Responsibility for paying off debt should also belong to die board of management. The Government's point is that the boards should be allowed to stand on their own two feet and be given credit for being able to cope with the responsibility of running a school. The Government seem to be saying, however, that they should not be asked to cope with the responsibility of administering the debt. That is inconsistent. If the Government cannot say that it would be a harmful bookkeeping exercise, why do they not accede to the amendment? It is in keeping with their comments about the purpose and responsibilities of boards of management.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has anticipated my argument against the amendments. He clearly appreciates that they would not save the local authority funds and that that is not their purpose. He should consider the practical problem of being unable to identify in an authority's capital account the debt relating to an individual project at a school. I agree that that is a terrible condemnation of accounting practice. I hope that school boards will help to change such practices. I know that Strathclyde is dealing with that problem. It could be part of a larger contract, or a series of contracts might be financed from a single loan.<br><br>
I realise the attraction of the accountability or community charge argument, but there are practical difficulties, so I ask the hon. Gentlemen to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the grant received by the local authority cover the entire debt? Would it cover the interest? It would be important if the local authority were expected to find money to pay off the debt from the pockets of community charge payers. That would be unfair, given that they would have no remit over the newly opted-out school. Presumably all the money would come from the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The money provided for self-governing schools will be deducted from the grant to the local authority. That is not unfair. The education authority is responsible for the education of pupils within its area. If they are being educated at a self-governing school, they are still within the state system and it would be strange to argue that the cost of that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1141</span>
provision should not be a burden on the education authority which carries the overall responsibility. I see no difficulty in that respect. That is the most practical and sensible way of proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not see a difficulty, but it could be argued that just as there should be no taxation without representation, there should be no taxation without responsibility for the service for which taxes are paid. If community charge payers have no democratic influence on the operation of a school, it would be unfair for them to be expected to pay towards the maintenance of that school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should perhaps cut out <i>of Hansard</i> the hon. Gentleman's remarks because they made the most powerful argument for the community charge that I have ever heard advanced by an Opposition Member. I completely agree with his sentiments in that respect.<br><br>
There is a confusion. We are not referring to debts incurred on developments at a school once it has become self governing, but to debts incurred by the local authority for the provision of education before it became self governing. It is appropriate that the authority should continue to fund those debts. If the funding of the debts were transferred to the self-governing school, it would be deducted from the grant anyway, as the hon. Gentleman recognised in his opening remarks. It would be a transfer payment, so I do not understand the difficulty.<br><br>
I urge the hon. Member for Western Isles to withdraw his amendment as we may be able to return to it later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some lingering questions, but they might be more appropriately dealt with on Report.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to know, Mr. Hogg, that we do not intend to make major speeches on the schedule. The best procedure may be to move the amendment briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In respect of amendments 198 and 199, it may help the Committee if I refer to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
provisions of clause 32(1). This provides the basic rule regarding the transfer to, and vesting in, a board of management of a self-governing school of all land or moveable property owned by the education authority and used or held by it for the purposes of the school. Clause 32(1) is qualified by the provisions of paragraph 2(2) of schedule 8, which deal with the difficult situation where property has been owned by the education authority and used or held for the purposes of more than one school. It may not be practical in every case, because of the nature of the property, for it to be divided between the new board of management of a self-governing school and the education authority. For those circumstances, paragraph 2(2) of schedule 8 provides some tests that should be applied in determining whether the property should transfer to the board of management or be retained by the education authority. If it is determined that the property is to transfer to the board of management, the rule in clause 32(1) will apply such that the property will transfer to, and vest in, the board. If the property remains with the education authority, the authority's position as owner will remain unchanged. It can be seen, accordingly, that amendments Nos. 198 and 199 are unnecessary.<br><br>
On amendment No. 200 I draw the attention of Opposition Members to paragraph 1(1)(b) of schedule 8. That permits, with reference to paragraph 2(2) and by agreement between the education authority and the commissioner for school assets, the making of any arrangements
<br><blockquote><p>"as will afford to the authority and the board as against each other such rights and safeguards as they may require for the proper discharge of their respective functions."</p></blockquote>
This provision, which applies to the arrangements to be made under paragraph 2(2) for the protection of the other party who will not have ownership of the property in question, is in terms wide enough to include any agreed user rights in respect of the property, or indeed any other similar rights, such as a right of access over school land. I understand the concern that such rights should be taken into account, but I assure the hon. Members who tabled amendment No. 200 that the point raised is already covered by paragraph 1(1)(b) of schedule 8. I agree that it is not a prominent provision.<br><br>
For the reasons that I have stated, I invite the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

This is a simple amendment and I await the Minister's response to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The commissioner for school assets will have to undertake a task of a highly specialised nature. It will require a good deal of knowledge of conveyancing practice; for instance, and may involve raising legal proceedings from time to time. Almost inevitably the commissioner will have to be legally qualified, or will have to employ professionals to assist him in his duties. Indeed, it is highly probable that the appointment would be of a law or accountancy firm. The equivalent function in England is to be performed by the education assets board, a body created under the Education Reform Act 1988. Instead of setting up a separate body, we thought it best to provide that for each case there should be an ad hoc appointment, preferably of someone local to the area.<br><br>
I acknowledge the reasons why the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr McLeish) suggests that we should insert the word "independent". A similar amendment was suggested earlier in relation to the body prescribed to conduct the ballots. The difficulty is that it is not acceptable on drafting grounds because it begs the question, independent of whom? I assure the hon.
