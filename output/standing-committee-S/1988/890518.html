	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXTENSION OF FUNCTIONS OF COMMISSION FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY ACCOUNTS IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) if a governing body so requests, the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland ('the Commission') may—
	<ol>
	<li>promote or undertake studies designed to improve the economy, the efficiency, or the effectiveness, of the management or operations of that body;</li>
	<li>in relation to that body's accounts in respect of any financial year—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>give advice as to the appointment of suitable persons; or</li>
	<li>arrange for members of the Commission's staff acceptable to that body,</li></ol></ol>
to audit those accounts.</p>
	<p>(2) For the purposes of this section 'governing body' means—
	<ol>
	<li>the board of management of a self-governing school; or</li>
	<li>a college council established under section 48 of this Act; or</li>
	<li>the board of directors of a company formed by an education authority by virtue of section 59 of this Act.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(3) Where the Commission provides services to a governing body under subsection (1) above they shall charge that governing body such fees as will enable the Commission to recover the whole cost of providing those services.</p>
	<p>(4) The provisions of section 97(3) of the 1973 Act (power of the Secretary of State to give directions to the Commission in relation to the discharge of their functions) shall apply in relation to the functions conferred on the Commission by subsection (1) of this section as they apply in relation to the functions conferred on the Commission by subsection (2) of that section.".—[	<i>Mr. Michael Forsyth.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would require the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland, on the request of the governing body of a self-governing school, a college council or a corporate college, to promote or undertake studies designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of such a body, or to give advice regarding the appointment of persons to audit the governing body's accounts, or to arrange for staff of the commission to do such auditing. It would enable the commission to become involved in those areas: indeed, the commission has requested it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would also provide that where the commission provided a governing body of any of the bodies mentioned with services, it would be entitled to charge fees that would cover the full cost of providing those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1472</span>
Finally, the new clause extends the powers given to the Secretary of State under section 97(3) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 to give general directions to the commission in respect of the discharge of its function. The Secretary of State's power of direction is to extend to the new functions given to the commission under the new clause. It is a purely technical requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 8</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DUTY OF EDUCATION AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"The education authority shall, on the incorporation date or as soon as practicable thereafter, provide the board of management of a self-governing school with all the information held by that authority in respect of that school including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, information in respect of—
	<ol>
	<li>the administration of the school;</li>
	<li>the fabric of the school;</li>
	<li>staff transferred from the employment of the authority to the employment of the board of management by virtue of section 21 of this Act; and</li>
	<li>the pupils in attendance at the school.".—	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.</i>]</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this new clause is to ensure that the education authority provides the board of management of a self-governing school with all the information that the authority holds as managers of the school. The board of management will be taking over the school as a going concern, and it follows that it ought to inherit all the relevant records that it will need as the new managers of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even without the new clause, most of the relevant information would pass to the board of management, as under clause 32 all moveable property relating to the school is to transfer to the school's board of mangement. Any written records relating to the school would count as moveable property and would therefore transfer. However, there is no property in information as such, and nowadays it is likely that some of the relevant records may be stored among many others unrelated to the school in question on a hard disk in the education authority's computer. The purpose of the new clause is to put it beyond doubt that any information relating to the school, in whatever form, should transfer to the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that confidential records relating to individual pupils or members of staff ought not to pass to the board of management. I shall deal with staff records first. When someone leaves one employer and goes to another, a new contract is made and it is up to the new employer to satisfy himself that he has the information that he requires about the person whom he is taking on. The new employer may request information from the former employer, but he does not have a right to demand it.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1473</span>
But we are not dealing with that here. The Bill provides specifically that the whole contract of employment transfers to the new employer just as if it had originally been made by the employee and the board of management. The board of management has no choice about that, any more than the individual member of staff: initially those on the board are going to have to take over the people who are already at the school, whether they like it or not. They will need basic records, in any case, for payroll purposes. But they are also entitled to receive information such as disciplinary records. Let us suppose that a member of staff had been disciplined by the education authority, and had perhaps received a final written warning. It would be wrong to entitle him to start again with a completely clean slate simply because the school had changed hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar considerations arise in the case of pupil records. The new board of management will take over the education authority's responsibility for managing the school and keeping it efficient. It is right, therefore, that any records that the education authority holds in its capacity as an education authority should be passed to the board of management. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 9</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>FURTHER AMENDMENT OF 1980 ACT IN RESPECT OF RECORDED CHILDREN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>" .—(1) In section 60(2) of the 1980 Act (powers and duties of education authority as regards children and young persons with special educational needs)—
	<ol>
	<li>in paragraph (a)(i), after the word 'age' there shall be added the words 'and are not children in respect of whom the authority is under a duty by virtue of sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) below';</li>
	<li>in paragraph (b), the words 'are of school age' shall be subparagraph (i) and after that sub-paragraph there shall be added the word '; or' and the following sub-paragraph—</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>'(ii) have not attained school age but, being at least two years of age, have come to the attention of the authority as having, or appearing to have, special educational needs,'.</li></div> <!-- ul --></ol></p>
	<p>(2) In section 61(1) of that Act (examination and assessment of children and young persons), in paragraph (b), for the words 'who is of school age' there shall be substituted the words 'in respect of whom the authority is under a duty under section 60(2) of this Act.'."—	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause makes an important change to the provisions for the assessment for the recording of children with profound, severe or complex special educational needs. It reflects the increasing awareness of the benefit of identifying children with impairments before they reach school age. The effectiveness of early treatment of physical handicap
	<span class='label label-info column'>1474</span>
was brought forceably home to me when I visited the Peto institute in Budapest. By accpepting the very youngest children, it was, in many cases, able to help cerebral palsied children walk and do other things much sooner than would normally be expected. Lowering the mandatory age of recording will encourage authorities in Scotland to identify children who may benefit from help with their special educational needs early in life, and to consider how they intend to provide that help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is estimated that 70 children per annum will need to be assessed in future and have a record of needs opened on their behalf. Not every record will have immediate consequences for provision. Many will be opened to enable the authorities to monitor the position and take action at the appropriate time. When we debated clause 65, the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), mentioned the work of the research team at Edinburgh university. She will be aware that it has reported that in almost half the number of records opened by authorities, the process took between six months and two years. If assessment does not begin until the age of five, as is the case now, very valuable time is lost and proper school placement decisions may be delayed. That will not happen in future. Of course, some new receords will be opened for pre-school children, which will reveal the need for provision. At the moment there are 85 records for children under five which have been opened because the authority recognised the need for early intervention. The proposals will increase the number of cases where the need for early provision is shown, but it is difficult to say how many that will be or the amount of resources involved. The extra cost will not, however, be significant when viewed against the background of over 6,000 current records and expenditure of £8.5 million. Provision for the special educational needs of children with records is made through the revenue support grant settlement. This is a package; it is not broken up into component parts. As I told the committee at our previous sitting, it has increased dramatically in real terms under this Government, by 75 per cent. over and above inflation in over eight years. I am confident that the aims of the new clause can be accommodated within that total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (b) amends section 60 (2) (b) of the 1980 act to place on education authorities a duty, where appropriate, to open a record of needs for children of between two and four years who have come to the authorities' attention as having or appearing to have special educational needs. That brings the Scottish legislation into line with that for England and Wales, where statements of needs must be opened from the age of two and is an example of anglicisation, which will be widely welcomed throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (a) is consequential, to ensure that authorities may continue to have power where they wish to open a record of needs for a child who is not yet two.

	<div class='title'>APPOINTMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'Where an education authority propose to make an appointment to a post of Principal Teacher or above in a school under their management they shall advertise the post in newspapers circulating widely in Scotland.'.—	<i>[Mr. Bill Walker.]</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause is very important. People in Scotland should be made aware of all available vacancies. Authorities should also have the widest possible choice of eligible qualified candidates from within the Scottish education system, for principal teachers or posts above that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have probably received the letter from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about the matter. COSLA seems to have a clear view on it, but its evidence shows a divided view. There is no question but that authorities such as Grampian, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles advertise their posts nationally. The practice is different in Strathclyde. Tayside also advertises nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA says that it opposes compulsory advertising. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Practice differs throughout Scotland because circumstances differ. Authorities feel they must be free to exercise discretion in responding to individual circumstances in their own areas, from the requirement for Gaelic speakers in the Western Isles".</p></blockquote>
The majority of Gaelic speakers live in the Glasgow area, so that argument is a bit thin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA also argues that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In larger authorities, additional staff would be required to cope with the volume of work."</p></blockquote>
That is not so. In commercial organisations where one department is responsible for staff advertising and recruitment, it is easy to cope with additional numbers. To say that additional staff would be required is a typical bureaucratic local authority response to what is only a little additional advertising. Advertising space is already being booked, so the only extra work is to put out the adverts to a few more newspapers. I, therefore, do not accept COSLA's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already said that teachers should be properly appraised to help them in their career. Those same good teachers should be given the opportunity, through advertising, to be made aware of the available promotion posts that will give them a proper career structure. It is irrelevant whether they live in Glasgow, the Western Isles or Tayside. If individuals are prepared to move, to take a chance with career prospects and apply for promoted posts, that can only be good for them, for schools, for children and for the education system in Scotland. The more people have moved around and seen of the wide world, the better for the important sphere of education. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able at least to accept the principles of new clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1476</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for moving the new clause. I agree that it is essential that teaching staff in all schools—whether education authority, independent or self-governing, and irrespective of the area in which they are employed— should have the opportunity to seek career advancement in any other school. It is in the interests of teachers to have fair and open career prospects, and in the interests of pupils that no obstacles should be placed in the way of vacancies being filled by the best available teachers through open competition. That can only be healthy for the overall school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 7,400 principal teachers in Scottish secondary schools are in many ways the core of the system. They are a vital tier of middle management at the heart of every effective secondary school with a crucial range of auricular responsibilities. In recent years, they have had the formidable task of adapting to the new standard grade examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, principal teacher is the first level of promoted post in secondary education where the salary is roll-related. In the largest schools the salary is almost £20,000. That represents an important step on the career ladder—even though many teachers, who are dedicated to their own specialist subjects, aspire to go no further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 now provides for head teacher, deputy head teacher and assistant head teacher posts to be advertised. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North made his case well, and effectively dealt with the letter, which I know that members of the Committee have received. Having considered the arguments, I believe that that facility should be extended to principal teachers in the interests of encouraging greater awareness of vacancies and thereby greater competition, which can only be to the benefit of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for technical reasons, it would be desirable to follow more closely the wording of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) will not press me on the precise nature of those technical reasons. But, for example, "and above" would be otiose. Schedule 2 to the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 refers to "intend" rather than to "propose" and to "publications circulating throughout Scotland" rather than to
	<br><blockquote><p>"newspapers circulating widely in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his new clause so that the draftsmen may advise on more appropriate wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are rather wider points of principle at issue—those of opportunity and of fairness. Not only should teachers be aware of vacancies to be filled, but any applications should be treated strictly according to their merits. The identity of their present employer should not colour the decision in any way. Fortunately, one of those factors will be covered by the Local Government and Housing Bill, which implements the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee of inquiry on the conduct of local authority business, and which is currently at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1477</span>
Report stage in the House. Clause 7 of that Bill provides that every appointment to paid employment in local government shall be made on merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be a welcome statutory safeguard, but it is also important that there should be unrestricted access to apply for teaching posts. My officials have sought the views of COSLA and I shall consider carefully its observations which I received this week. I shall also take note of the opinions expressed this morning before deciding whether to introduce a new clause on Report, to ensure that there are no barriers to registered teachers applying for vacant posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is a satisfactory response to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North and that the Committee will be content with my assurances about advertising and open access to teaching posts, with which we shall deal later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new clause was suggested by the Scottish Consumer Council. It has two purposes. First, it would allow voluntary organisations with charitable status, including parents' organisations, to establish their own schools and run them at public expense. Secondly, it would allow fee-paying, independent but non-profit-making schools to "opt into" the maintained sector of education. The Bill deals with choice of management, not choice of school. The establishment of fully maintained voluntary schools would unquestionably extend choice for parents in sparsely populated areas where there is limited choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would also provide choice for parents who have a positive interest in running their own schools, just as, for example, public sector tenants have the opportunity to run their own housing co-operatives. Such moves have been welcomed across the political spectrum. Parents who have become disenchanted with the school system in the public and private sectors, will find the new clause attractive. Many of the parents who have taken advantage of their legal right to educate their children at home could be interested in that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Consumer Council believes that some established voluntary organisations, such as parents' organisations or charities, will be interested in setting up their own schools. There are precedents for that. A community in Scoraig in Wester Ross has already been given funds by the education authority to run its own school because of its geographical remoteness. My hon. Friend the Minister is interested in Denmark, whose education ministry is following our move to introduce schools boards. Voluntary organisations in Denmark are given Government grants of up to 85 per cent. to run their own schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new clause, maintained voluntary schools would be subject to the same checks on their efficiency, building and other standards as education authority schools. They would also be bound by legislation on sexual and racial discrimination and by the parents' charter legislation of 1980, which deals with admissions to schools and information for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister may argue that the Secretary of State already has the necessary powers, but their potential is not widely known. Even if the Government have such powers, it would be helpful if they were added to the Bill so that the possibilities were made known to voluntary organisations, parents' groups and others who might be interested in taking advantage of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 3, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), is important. Many voluntary bodies and groups of parents in Scotland believe that they know more about what would benefit children—whether or not they are right—if they had the opportunity to influence the legislation.

We are living in a world of dramatic change. Anyone who has been watching television would realise what I mean by that. The scenes of students in Beijing—Peking, as we used to know it—show how education is one of the first sectors in which any nation begins to acknowledge and recognise change. Who would have thought, even a year ago, that we would see such scenes on television?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood has said, we know what is happening in Denmark. There is nothing odd about Scandinavian countries being in the vanguard of such matters, as they have often been ahead of the rest of Europe in many respects. I have not always agreed with particular moves, but we must acknowledge how enterprising they have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood drew attention to the example of the public housing sector co-operatives. We have seen clearly what can happen in a community through those co-operatives, how people can work together and how that improves their environment. If educational voluntary bodies wish to become established, I should have thought that this Government, of all Governments, would be prepared to make it possible. Indeed, they should make such a development by giving it a fair wind with possibile grants for voluntary organisations or groups of parents to run their own schools. Some parents believe that they can teach their children better at home, and that may be so. Each case would have to be considered on its own merits. In some circumstances, parents are equipped, both academically and in every other way, to give their children a better education than they would receive in the area where they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is good. It would be in the best interests of Scottish tradition for schools to be incorporated to belong to a registered charity. That is how many of our best schools came into being. We are simply giving the opportunity in the late 1980s for parents to do that which earlier generations were able to do before education was lumped under the control of local authorities. In the days before local authority control, it was fairly commonplace in Scotland for various groups of individuals and charitable bodies to set up educational establishments. That was recognised as an aspect of community life in many parts of Scotland. The history of the schools and records of excellence show that they were built on sound foundations. Those schools had sound foundations because motivation was what mattered. The motivation was right, and people were motivated to do the best that they could for their community. When my hon. Friend the Minister responds, I hope that he will acknowledge that this is in keeping not only with Scottish traditions but with the views, the mood, the policy and the philosophy of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister for Eastwood answered his own question by pointing to the fact that we already have the necessary powers to meet the wish of the Scottish Consumer Council
	<span class='label label-info column'>1480</span>
and the substance of the new clause. However, I endorse the aim of the new clause, which is to provide further opportunity for parents to enjoy choice and variety in the educational system, through the provision of a new category of school. The Government subscribe wholeheartedly to that aim. It is exemplified in the provisions in the Bill to introduce self-governing schools and technology academies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause gives the Secretary of State or an education authority power to make grants to registered independent schools on a number of conditions. Under sections 24 and 73 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, education authorities and the Secretary of State already have wide powers to provide grant-aid to educational establishments. In some respects, the existing powers are wider than those proposed in the new clause since—subject to approval of grant regulations—the Secretary of State and authorities can make grants to any managers of educational establishments on any conditions that are appropriate to the case. Those powers have of course been used in recent years, by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to make grant to Jordanhill school and by Highland region to support the development of a small school at Scoraig.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend corrects my pronunciation; I take his advice. Anyway, it is a very interesting school and an interesting development in Scottish education of parent co-operative power in action. To that extent, therefore, the new clause is strictly unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that, as I have said, the Government support the principle of variety and choice. We will be interested to consider any proposals for new kinds of schools seeking Government support and would welcome developments supported by education authorities, particularly for rural and remote areas, where that sort of provision may represent a prudent and economical use of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood mentioned Denmark, and it is true that Denmark operates a system whereby groups of parents are actively encouraged to set up their own schools. However, there are also interesting examples of that principle at work in Spain and the Netherlands. One of the facts that I found interesting when looking at the background to this is that in the Netherlands, 100 per cent. state funding is available for any school as long as it meets certain requirements concerning the number of pupils involved and other criteria. The result is that about 69 per cent. of Dutch pupils attend state funded private or non-Government schools. It is an interesting commentary on the arguments of those in Scotland who believe that it is not possible for self-governing schools to be run effectively within the education system that our European partners seem to operate a system of state-funded independent schools with considerable success.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause is short and simple. I realise the terrible danger of that. It contains no arcane words. There are no heretofores or without prejudices. There are no attestations or subscriptions or executions, valid or invalid. It does not even contain a reference to the party of the third part. That almost certainly means that it is out of order. However, it has a simple, serious and useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2, if a school opts to become self-governing it must, within a certain time, produce a scheme of government that the Secretary of" State has to approve. There is thus a negative power to prevent bad practice. It makes sense also to provide positive guidance from the outset. In so doing, the Government would not be taking on what the Minister might describe as a nanny role. If a school opts to be self-governing, that does not mean that it will have the expertise to produce a scheme of self-government, so it will inevitably look around for advice. Where would it get advice? I am told that independent bodies are setting themselves up in England to do precisely that. In Scotland, it would be better if the Scottish Education Department itself produce a guide to best practice. It need not be rigid but it would spell out the essential framework. Therefore, it would be helpful if the Government accepted the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the weaknesses of the Bill is the lack of an effective procedure for the return of a self-governing school to the control of an education authority. In discussions on clause 29, it was suggested that the new clause would be the appropriate vehicle for such a procedure. In many ways, clause 29 is inadequate, especially with regard to the education authority. The new clause has been drafted with the help of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council to provide a simple and effective method of allowing self-governing schools to return to education authority control. It also provides a veneer of democracy. The rest of the Bill is about balloting to remove schools from the education authority sector to self-governing status, whereas the new clause allows a second ballot to take place if a board decides that it wishes to return to the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is reasonably well drafted and we await the Minister's comments on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is keeping me busy this morning, and it is proving extremely difficult to mark the examination papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that the new clause does which cannot be achieved under the Bill is to provide for a ballot of parents on the question of a return to local authority control. The existing provisions of the Bill are adequate to ensure the transfer of a school back to the management of an education authority if the authority agrees to take it back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it curious that the new clause says that a ballot "may" be held if the board of management receives a request from 10 per cent. of parents. I should have thought that the Opposition, with their customary attention to such matters of drafting, would have wanted to say that a ballot "shall" be held in those circumstances. However, I doubt whether the committee wants to enter a may or shall debate at this stage in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see a logic in the idea that transfer back to the education authority should be triggered by a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1484</span>
ballot of parents in the same way as the original opting-out process was triggered. Nevertheless, I do not think that the idea stands up to closer examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place, a board of management will be, by its very constitution, much more closely representative of parental opinion that an education authority could be. A conflict of view between the board and the general body of parents can be rectified at the next two-yearly election of parent representatives. Moreover, the board will be subject to a provision equivalent to that in the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, under which parents may request an open meeting with the board, and such a meeting can pass a resolution that the board will have to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are powerful safeguards, which will ensure that a board is properly responsive to parental wishes. If it really is the wish of the majority of parents that the school should return to education authority management, I am confident that those provisions will be adequate to ensure that that wish finds expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, I cannot accept that a board should be obliged in all circumstances to get majority approval in a ballot for a proposal to discontinue the school as a self-governing school. It is the board, not the general body of parents, who will carry legal and financial responsibility for the school, and it would not be tolerable that it should be shackled from taking a decision, in an extreme case, that the school simply could not continue on its present basis and must close or revert to education authority management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I consider this discussion highly theoretical. Of course we must have these escape provisions, but self-governing schools will be popular and well-subscribed. Closures will be rare, and reversions to education authority management even rarer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the discussion after the Minister's weak and flippant rejection of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council's suggestion. Clause 29 is inadequate and weak. Will the Minister write to me and explain how it allows for the procedure that we are discussing in new clause 5, when it does not even refer to the education authority? If there is a process to opt out of the education authority system, there should be an effective way to get back in to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his application of democratic principles, there is an inconsistency in the Minister's logic. While there is a ballot to leave the public sector, all the powers will then be vested in the board to make a major decision about discontinuance without further recourse to a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='title'>PLAYGROUND SUPERVISION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"It shall be the duty of every education authority to secure that adequate provision is made for the playground supervision of pupils in attendance at schools in that area.".—[Mr. Bill Walker.]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be aware, Mr. Martin, that new clause 6 is the last change proposed to the Bill. However, I should not like the Committee to think that because it comes last in the batting order, it is the least important. Of all the matters that we have debated, one of the most important aspects of education is how we bring up our children to live in the world and accept the responsibilities that that involves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the tragedies of recent times has been the way that playground supervision has deteriorated. In some cases, it has become non-existent. One may ask why we need supervision. As every parent knows, children can get up to mischief. Sometimes innocent mischief and high spirits can lead to nasty occurrences. When that happens, it is too late to wish that things had been different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen recent developments among school children that many of us wish had not taken place, such as the increase in glue-sniffing. In Perth, which is part of my constituency, that used to cause problems. No member of the Committee wants that sort of activity to carry on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the traditional activity of smoking. The Europeans seem to have clear views on what we should put on cigarette packets. According to what I have heard, one cannot even read the advice on the cigarette packets. However, children—particularly young children—should be left alone so that it is possible for them to get up to that sort of mischief. Intimidation and harassment also go on in some schools. I have had several complaints in my constituency that have led to court cases. That is a factor that we must all bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, Scottish parents—maybe mistakenly— imagined that because of the in loco parentis situation
	<span class='label label-info column'>1486</span>
in schools, their children were being looked after by the teachers in the same way that parents would care for them. I understand that, by introducing measures dealing with the legal obligations of teachers, cases brought against teachers must go through the tortuous process of the courts. The purpose of the new clause is to make the local authority responsible for ensuring that the playground supervision of pupils attending schools in its area is done properly. The authority must lay down a workable regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that that probably means that teachers will be given that job, but that is not a bad thing. It is impossible to operate a regime that does one thing in the classroom and another in the playground. It is in the interests of teachers and pupils that the standard of discipline and the code of behaviour are the same throughout the school—in the classroom and in the playground. Surely teachers will welcome the opportunity to have spelt out clearly what is expected, who is expected to do it and how it is to be done and such a ruling can come only from the responsible authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt my hon. Friend the Minister will say that the wording of the new clause is flawed. I am prepared to accept that, provided that he and the Committee understand that the motivation behind it is the concern that is genuinely felt throughout Scotland about the problems in several school playgrounds. I know that some schools—there are some in my constituency—do not have the same problems as those in inner city schools, but even in rural constituencies, problems are caused because there is no adequate regime that defines accountability and responsibility and lays down who does what and when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that problems exist and that something must be done about them. We should then at least end our proceedings on a note of agreement. I am sure that every member of the Committee wants to ensure that adequate supervision is provided to prevent mischief developing into matters of serious concern, that the timid child is not bullied, or that the children of local personalities are intimidated by their peers, as sometimes happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will support the new clause. If my hon. Friend the Minister says that the wording is flawed, I hope that he will accept the principle and acknowledge that a problem exists, and should be tackled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Indeed, I put my name to the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for speaking is to place a slightly different emphasis on the issue. It is generally accepted that there is a need for more supervision in playgrounds and I refer my hon. Friend the Minister to the practice in France. Although I do not expect him to give a commitment today, he may like to comment on it. I can send him more details if necessary. France has what is called the surveillants system. Surveillants are professional keepers of discipline, for want of a better expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not teach, they rise up through the school. However, despite the fact that French schools are large, comprehensive schools, French state education has an excellent reputation, so excellent that the private sector has dwindled away almost entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) saying, "Hear, hear."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is excellent because it is based on tight discipline. Not all surveillants are professional. I was a surveillant in a French school. The system works well because, while the professionals are paid well, are professional in their attitude and stay in the job all their life, most of the work is done by young men between school and university and school and job. It is an excellent job, for which they are paid a modest wage, which is important if one is a young man, especially in my case. They take all the burden of supervision away from teachers. The system extends far beyond playground supervision, although that is an important part of it. It means that the teacher can concentrate entirely on teaching. The whole business of keeping discipline, overseeing school meals, ensuring that young children are collected, and other children supervised when they go on trips—which places so much burden on our teachers in England and Scotland—is entirely removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I understand the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North. He put the emphasis on teachers being required to do that job, but there is a limit on the burdens that we can place on teachers and on the community charge payers. Although I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to respond today, I shall ensure that a teacher who has tried to impress these ideas on the English Secretary of State for Education and Science writes to my hon. Friend. I have written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science who has shown an interest in these proposals. Scotland has often been interested in developments in France, and I am sure would not look askance at a French system of education. Therefore, if my hon. Friend is interested in considering the French surveillant system, I shall send him information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will take up the offer of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) who has introduced a new, international dimension into the debate. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend was opening his bid for a post in the Whips' Office in the next reshuffle. Clearly, his experience is relevant to the important matter, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in the new clause.

	<i>The Observer</i> of 30 April 1989 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the middle of the lunch break at Craigmuir Primary School in Pilton, Edinburgh. The gates are wide open and there is not an adult in sight. Small children, not more than six years old, occasionally leave the playground and cross to the large recreation ground on the other side of the road.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1488</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A few hundred yards away at Inchview Primary there appears to be the same absence of playground supervision although here the children leaving the school seem to be even smaller and some of the potential exists are more unorthodox. In one corner of a playground there are gaps in the fence that even a fully-grown adult could easily negotiate.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A brief drive round the area near these two schools reveals a dozen five and six-year-olds wandering around unaccompanied. The dangers are obvious but they are not peculiar to this part of Edinburgh."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was absolutely right to underline the concern of parents. The worry is not the same for secondary school children. The worry is about small children at primary schools wandering off, having accidents and being bullied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are very worried by the situation. We have written to all the regions asking what they are doing, but only two have replied."</p></blockquote>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister and the Scottish Office on what they have done, because I understand that they have allocated £4 million for 1989–90 within the revenue support grant so that the regions can pay helpers to provide lunchtime supervision in playgrounds. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North emphasised the duties of teachers, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said, there is an important role for those who can help teachers. After all, teachers need their lunch the same as everybody else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely fair of the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always extremely fair in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position appears to vary widely. Strathclyde has provision for supervision only in special schools. There is to be a COSLA working party, but it will not convene until all the necessary interdisciplinary persons have been assembled. In Lothian there is some supervision and it is considering the matter. Western Isles has "no specific arrangements" for playground supervision and appears to have what might be described as a rather different policy on such matters—which is not surprising in the Western Isles. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"the educational outlook of this council is that children should be free to play without adult supervision or restraint."</p></blockquote>
That may be OK in the Western Isles, but it would not be tolerable to take that position in the centre of our big cities, with major traffic and other problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Borders region has traditionally relied on head teachers, janitors and cleaners. Dumfries and Galloway provides supervision, as does Central region—my hon. Friend the Minister's own education authority. Highland provides no playground supervision—presumably, for similar reasons, it takes the same attitude as Western Isles. Fife has no specific arrangements. Tayside depends on head teachers and senior staff and Orkney employs auxiliaries at bigger schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Scottish Parent Teacher Council is concerned, and that circumstances vary. In some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1489</span>
respects that is perfectly reasonable. Conditions in many schools in the Highlands or Western Isles—in the rural areas—are different from places such as Pilton, which was referred to in the article that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is real concern about the matter. Of course, it costs money to provide extra supervision, but my hon. Friend the Minister has allowed for that. I hope that he will accept either the new clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North or its principle. The perils of the playground alarm Scottish parents. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond positively to this important debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the new clause were accepted, I would be concerned about several points. One could not expect teachers to carry out the duty because the ratio of teachers to pupils is one: 18 or one:20. The duty has always been a senior management responsibility and in my experience it has been carried out quite well. We have to decide what the problem is, and whether there is an identifiable problem. There is concern about it, but would providing more resources be the answer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my own constituency a year ago, a young child was allegedly molested. We investigated that. No matter how many supervisors there were in the playground, it is not absolutely certain that the incident would have been avoided. The child was playing by the railings, someone drew up in a car and the incident was over and done with, within 30 seconds. Therefore, although resources are important, in the light of that experience I believe that the best way to solve the problem is through communication between the education department, the police and the social work department. In that case the police became involved at the school and social workers had an input, too. The resources of all the agencies were pooled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that amplify my remarks? We want the education authority to lay down a regime with clearly defined responsibilities and accountability. People will then know what their duties are. The present position can best be described as woolly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opinion, the new clause is vague. Its provisions are generalised and are not well defined. The hon. Gentleman is arguing the case against his own new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resources are important, but even if they are provided, all the problems might not be overcome. There are also legal implications. The new clause states: "adequate provision is made". Will the Minister tell us what the legal implications are? If an incident occurs, no matter the amount of resources provided, will parents have the right of recourse to litigation? I hope that the Minister will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of trips abroad. Sadly, there have been fatalities on them in recent years. That has demonstrated the need for enough staff to supervise the pupils. We need one staff member for every six or eight pupils. If a secondary school has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1490</span>
over 1,000 pupils, that means that over 100 employees will be needed to supervise them. There are over 4,000 schools in Scotland, so that gives us some idea of the resource implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the problems and fears of parents, but I remain cautious. Putting in resources and a nominal number of supervisers in playgrounds will not solve all the problems that might occur. Experience in my constituency verifies that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, will be delighted to hear that this is probably the last time in this Committee that you will have to put up with my words of wisdom or otherwise. I note that we can debate this important new clause until 10 o'clock this evening. My hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) told me that if I were to do that, I should be speaking in an empty Room. I reminded him that if I were speaking in an empty Room, the Bill could not be reported to the House. None the less, I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important new clause, which should be given serious consideration. I was absent from the Committee a moment ago, because I went to the Library to try to find an article that appeared in a heavy, quality newspaper at the beginning of the week. I thought that it was in 	<i>The Times,</i> but I could not find it, so it must have been in either 	<i>The Guardian</i> or 	<i>The Independent.</i> It was a long, detailed article about playground bullying, which is a serious problem in some schools in both Scotland and England. The new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will go some way towards dealing with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Playground bullying leaves a deep impression on the pupils who suffer from it. Part of the reason for it is the lack of adequate supervision. The teaching profession has not given enough attention to the fact that greater supervision is needed, and the new clause will deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former teacher, I am aware of the problem of the lack of playground supervision and of bullying, which can be intimidating for the victims. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) mentioned that other problems also arise; children run the risk of being molested when they are not supervised. New clause 6 does not deal with the practical aspects of how such problems can be overcome. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every education authority to secure that adequate provision is made"</p></blockquote>
for playground supervision. Is "adequate provision" a legal term? I know of no legal definition of that term. Almost every one of the three or four Conservative Members who spoke this morning gave a different interpretation of it. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that teachers should provide adequate provision, but how will that be built into their contracts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that I made it clear that I expected my hon. Friend the Minister to tell me that new clause 6 was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0838">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1491</span>
flawed, but that I was concerned with the principle. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will talk about that. I accept that the new clause of myself and of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) may well be flawed, but we wish to ascertain how to deal with the problem if there is one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right; there is a problem. I wanted to point out that the new clause is open to different interpretations. The hon. Gentleman said that teachers should be responsible for providing adequate playground supervision. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said that a form of the public school fagging system should be introduced, whereby older pupils look after younger ones. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said that education authorities should employ helpers to work in the playgrounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood from the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastwood that money is available in the revenue allocation to local authorities, but the Government make many such claims. There are more claims than money available, and local authorities cannot afford to employ extra people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the principle of extra supervision in school playgrounds everywhere, but the Government must back up that principle with a real commitment of resources and allocate money to the education authorities to enable them to implement it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that human resources, in the form of teachers, are already available in schools? In the past there was adequate supervision in playgrounds. What has gone wrong? What has changed? The teacher pupil ratio has gone down since I was at school, but we had adequate playground supervision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no expertise on the days when the hon. Gentleman was at school, because that was a long time ago. I was surprised when the hon. Member for Eastwood said that head teachers and senior staff in Tayside were responsible for supervision in playgrounds. I was a teacher in Tayside and supervised in playgrounds, but that was before Tory Governments disrupted education, interfered with teachers' contracts and broke up all the good will that teachers had for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot demand that teachers fulfil the duties outlined in the new clause. They will not stand for it. Because of the Government they are now in the process of arguing with education authorities about the terms of their contracts and are in a defensive frame of mind. They would be upset at any suggestion that it was their duty to implement supervision. Teachers do not have a duty at present to supervise playgrounds or lunch hours. Even the hon. Member for Eastwood is prepared to admit that teachers should be allowed a lunch hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My children attend St. Columba's primary school in Kirkton in Dundee. The biggest problem arises during the lunch hour, when children leave school and go to the local shops. How can they be supervised there? Local shopkeepers complain to their
	<span class='label label-info column'>1492</span>
councillors and Members of Parliament about the children in their shops. To where does the responsibility for such supervision extend? Many practical problems must be confronted. I hope that the Minister will be honest enough to admit that those problems must be confronted, by passing them not to the teachers, but to the Government, who should release the resources that will allow education authorities to employ the type of staff who can provide the necessary supervision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intervening only because the hon. Gentleman referred to me earlier and, whether innocently or deliberately, he misunderstood what I said. The surveillant system—or supervisor system, to give its English expression—has nothing to do with fagging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much more moderate in my opinion on that than my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth). The French surveillant system is entirely professional. In large schools professional surveillants sometimes employ young people to help them. That is not fagging. If anything, it has a correlation with the prefect system. There is nothing wrong with older children looking after younger children. Is the hon. Gentleman against the prefect system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I was a prefect at St. Augustine's, but I was not paid for that. I was an easy-going prefect, did not report anyone to the teachers and let people away with all types of things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman causes me even greater anxiety when he says that the French professional system involves young people. If the Minister had his way, he would put YTS people in charge of young children in playgrounds. Nothing is beyond the Government's capability. I have realised over the past 10 years that the Government will go to any extremes. However imaginative the Opposition are in dreaming up ideas that the Government might implement, they go further than we can imagine. That worries me. Therefore, we must always be cautious about suggestions from Conservative Members. I am cautious about this measure. The Committee must confront the serious problem involved, but it will not be confronted by pious new clauses that do not say how the end result of better supervision can be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having acknowledged that there is a problem, does the hon. Gentleman believe that teachers have a part to play in resolving it? If so, how can that be achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Teachers always have a part to play in discipline problems in schools. The ethos of the school depends on how the teachers teach and relate to the pupils. That is different from saying that they must give up their lunch hours and breaks to supervise children in the playground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1493</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that in his contribution. Other Conservative Members suggested something else. The new clause is vague because it does not specify how it will be implemented. That is the problem facing the Minister. How do we tackle the problem? I hope that the Minister will concede that the practical implications are not dealt with in the new clause. I support it in principle, but I want some means by which it can be implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will not accept new clause 6, not because it has no substance, but because it is a difficult area to legislate for. We have received representations from groups in Strathclyde that are worried about supervision. In my area, there are always stories about bullying and other problems regarding safety and supervision in the school environment. That is not new. I have had enormous problems in my constituency with the issue of school transport and the jurisdiction over who is responsible for the children, who is responsible at school, and what happens between school and home. But it would be meaningless to accept the new clause because it would mean nothing in practical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) what the Opposition would do. There is no point in accepting a new clause that has no practical implications. It would be better to initiate a dialogue because everyone agrees that there are problems. The best way to proceed is for schools, education authorities and the Scottish Office to assess the incidence of the problems. There have been many instances of bullying in particular schools and the Scottish Office may have statistics to show whether the trend is upwards or is remaining stable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The resource implications are crucial. Teachers are already stretched because of changes in curricula. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said that teachers have a part to play. However, the onus should not fall on them alone although they have a valuable role to play in discipline generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has often mentioned the ethos and leadership of a school. My experience in Fife has been that the schools that have few problems in the playground have head teachers and middle management people who try to tackle discipline problems in a constructive and socially imaginative way. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said, physical supervision in the playground involves significant resources and education authorities are already stretched. I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the new clause and that the way forward must be in the form of a partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a discussion on BBC radio this week with the chairman of Lothian education committee and a head teacher from a Scottish school. The chairman urged that the matter should be put into perspective. The instances of bullying or children falling in the playground and hurting themselves are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1494</span>
far fewer that those involving problems at home, which relate to parental control and supervision. This is an important subject but accepting the new clause would be of no practical benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by dealing with the issue of a teacher's responsibility for supervision, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). He has done us a great service in moving the new clause. Teachers have no contractual responsibility for supervision. In view of the spirit of unity that is breaking out in the final stages of the Committee, I do not expect teachers to take on that duty. It should be left to authorities to make appropriate arrangements. They could—many already do—use auxiliaries, but there is no reason why teachers should not be involved if they wish. I do not intend to alter teachers' terms and conditions. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) who was very worried about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) that abduction difficulties can be dealt with merely by the police and social workers getting together. A playground supervisor's role should extend to keeping children away from places where they could be at risk. I received a letter from the Nithsdale road link-up group in Glasgow. The letter, dated 3 April 1989, may have been circulated to members of the Committee. Its fourth paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our area we understand that at least twice someone has tried to abduct a child from a playground during playtime. They have not as yet succeeded because of the fact that the older children intercepted, but these children are all under 12 and should not have this kind of responsibility thrust upon them. As most of us live too far from our local schools and have the commitment of younger children, we cannot always pick children up at lunchtime to take them home or be aware of what is happening during morning and afternoon breaks."</p></blockquote>
It is clear from the letters and representations that I have received and the press reports, such as the one to which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) drew our attention, that there is no adequate supervision in many of our school playgrounds. Like the parents who come to see me and who write to me on the subject, I am not only concerned, I am angry. At present, education authorities—the hon. Member for Dumbarton asked me about this—have no statutory duty to arrange for the care of pupils at school. The authorities' duty arises from the common law and there is a duty of care in that sense. I understand that that is likely to be interpreted by a court as meaning that the authority should take the same steps as would a reasonable parent to ensure the safety of pupils. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was quite right about that. It is difficult to see how authorities can claim that their current arrangements properly satisfy the terms of that duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a broad concensus on the problem. Can the Minister give us some more evidence to justify the attack on the education authorities and the allegation that they are not fulfilling that common law duty? Apart from that letter, what is the evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1495</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have seen the information that has been provided by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, which has expressed considerable concern. I know that the hon. Gentleman has been in the House of Commons for a short time but I would be surprised if he has not had representations from his constituents about this. I certainly have, as have my hon. Friends. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East acknowledged, this is a long running saga, which has caused great concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By saying exactly, the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that there is evidence that there is a problem. A feature of the Government is that we face up to difficult problems and try to resolve them. I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North for tabling the new clause. Last year, when considering the problem, I thought that it was appropriate to encourage local authorities and we provided resources—£4 million— within the revenue support grant to allow them to provide supervision. They now say that they cannot find the money. Some authorities—not all of them— simply do not choose to give priority to the need to provide supervision in playgrounds. They have the money and the responsibility but they choose not to respond to the clear and understandable anxieties of parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that there is evidence that this is a problem. Where is the evidence that some authorities are wilfully refusing to confront the problem and do something about it? Does the Minister have that evidence? If he does not, why does he make that allegation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Gentleman looks at the letter that COSLA sent him, which details the arrangements—I beg your pardon, Mr. Martin, that is not correct. I have seen somewhere some information about the arrangements that are made for different authorities. I am happy to send the hon. Gentleman a transcript of the discussion that took place on BBC Radio Scotland the other day about this. There is widespread concern. There is clear anxiety about the differing practices in schools. That was reflected in some of the speeches this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have a common law duty. They have complained that they do not have the resources that they require to carry out playground supervision. I have made the money available and the fact that local authorities are pleading lack of resources is an admission that the provision being made is not adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example of that is what Councillor Geddes said on BBC Radio Scotland earlier this week. He is the convenor of the education committee of Lothian region which is, I understand, controlled by the Labour party at present. I imagine that Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>1496</span>
Members would have come across him. Councillor Geddes said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we did a survey of all the school councils in Lothian and quite a few actually said, Look we think there should be playground supervision, but if the money has to come from books and equipment or maintenance, we don't think it should have that sort of priority. That definitely is a concern for most regional authorities in Scotland."</p></blockquote>
I can well understand that reaction, particularly from parents in the Lothian region. They know how a year ago the region, having to cut back on a hopelessly inflated budget, made cuts just where the savings could most quickly and easily be realised—on the schools' capitation allowance for books, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a simple question of books versus playground supervision. We calculated that £4 million was the sum needed to provide supervision in schools across the country. That money is available now, and I suggest that before Councillor Geddes and his colleagues rush us to judgment, they should see how they get on with that extra provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked for evidence. There we have a convenor of an education committee of a Labour-controlled education authority admitting that there is a problem and also saying that he has other priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister admit that it is not just a problem of resources? At a ration of 1:20, we could be talking about 50,000 staff employed in schools. Even that is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the different agencies in the abduction case, because that showed the community involvement. It is a matter of education. In my area, the community involvement branch went round schools showing the film, "Don't Talk to Strangers", which gave children a particular way of looking at problems. In fact, it was so successful that once when my son was going up our road and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) asked him where I lived, my son said, "Sorry, I can't tell you. I've not to talk to strangers".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is not better known in the household of the hon. Member for Dumbarton. Along with the hon. Member for Dumbarton, I pay tribute to the work done by the police and the local authorities, which has undoubtedly had a significant effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tripped myself up earlier in respect of the COSLA letter, and was rescued by forces invisible in the Committee. I was in fact referring to the Scottish Parent Teacher Council press release, which mentions a COSLA survey revealing that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"playground and lunchtime supervision arrangements vary immensely not only from authority to authority but also from school to school".</p></blockquote>
The SPTC went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This situation is not acceptable to SPTC. The safety of children is too important to be left to the goodwill of headteachers and staff."</p></blockquote>
As to the comment of the hon. Gentleman for Dumbarton that we need 50,000 people, that is some what over-egging the pudding of adequate supervision in the playground. There is a common
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1497</span>
law duty. We are considering whether there should be a statutory duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members criticised the new clause for its vague drafting. Their criticisms were similar to many criticisms that I have made in respect of their amendments. In this case, I assure them that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North intends that the Government will introduce proposals on playground supervision. I am happy to tell my hon. Friend that the Government will go much further than he expected. I give an undertaking that the Government will shortly introduce regulations under the powers already available to the Secretary of State in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Those regulations will put a clear statutory duty on authorities to provide adequate levels of playground supervision and allow the Secretary of State to act against authorities that do not properly discharge their duty of care. By proceeding in that way, we can have the new statutory provisions in place quickly, before the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle asked whether I would be interested in hearing from one of his constituents about provisions in France. He said that he had referred his constituent's letter to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science. I would be interested to hear the details of the innovative scheme that his constituent describes, as playground supervision does not necessarily need to involve paid people, even for playgrounds of the adventurous kind, which operate effectively in France. Parents could also be involved, and it is distressing to see the hostility in some quarters to parents becoming involved in playground supervision. I hope that the new duty will help to concentrate minds. I am grateful to my hon. Friend and am sure that the Committee will be interested to hear about that European dimension so that we can consider it on a proper basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North will withdraw the new clause and that we can end our proceedings on a note that will unite the Committee: agreement about the importance of providing adequate playground supervision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had the remedy in his hands for some time. He is now to solve the problem by regulation, which is an excellent idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have attacked education authorities and have claimed that they have provided them with adequate resources. Although some education authorities may deserve to be attacked, the Government have now been in power for 10 years. If the complexities of revenue support grant were properly explained, the Committee would see that, in the Government's enormous budget, £4 million is lost when compared with the problems facing education authorities. If the Government are to introduce regulations, I hope that they will consult education authorities about resource implications. Merely to regulate so that local authorities become involved in supervision, without providing proper support, will not improve the current position, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1498</span>
is, as the Minister says, inadequate. We look forward to the regulations as long as there is consultation and an appreciation that the issue is complex and may require resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman criticising the Government for not intervening quickly enough to direct education authorities? Is he also saying that the education authorities are not meeting their common law duty? I thought that he had previously argued that they were doing so, in which case the statutory provision should not have significant resource implications, although we have provided extra resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fine distinction between the descriptions being used by the Minister. The common law duty is well appreciated by education authorities, but the Minister omits to say that this is not a simplistic point for which we can regulate or legislate. Factors such as discipline, the home background and the ethos of the school must be considered. The problem is complex, and if we are to proceed by regulations, we must not use the education authorities as the whipping boy but must discuss, analyse and ensure that any remedy that is prescribed in regulations tackles the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not critical of the central organisation having a role in the matter: the Scottish Office is there to give guidelines and to work in partnership with local authorities on a wide range of problems. That is about to be done in this matter, and we welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that the matter is complex. The hon. Gentleman mentioned values and standards in schools. I said earlier that we cannot have one set of values in the classroom and a different set in the playground, I agree with the welcome comment made by my hon. Friend the Minister, that parents as well as teachers should be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, in a dismissive way, that after 10 years of this Government nothing would surprise him. The measure under which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can act is the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which this Government put on the statute book. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood and I feel that education authorities have not faced up to their common law duty and we tabled the new clause to initiate a debate that might result in some agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the Lothian education authority is telling parents nothing this weekend about plans—or lack of plans—for extra supervision and that the Western Isles authority has no specific arrangements. Dumfries and Galloway is already spending £104,000 a year on playground supervision, and Central region has 330 school helpers at a cost of £560,000. Resources have been made available to education authorities. The question is whether education authorities are willing to make them available to schools. I hope that our debates on this issue will have the same impact in Scotland as the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 has had. Our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1499</span>
debates on the Bill have already produced positive responses, so I hope that education authorities will respond positively to this debate. We can have leadership in schools only if standards and values are set by those who are directly responsible—the teachers. Attitude is vital: if it recognises the importance of standards and values, we can make progress, but if it is negative—the "it does not affect us" attitude—we shall not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some education authorities have been dragging their feet and I hope that their attitudes will now change, as will those of teachers. Parents and teachers must become involved so that we can deal effectively with the problem. Resources are available for supervision. I am encouraged by the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister and I hope that we can end our proceedings in a spirit of unanimous support for what is being done.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. It would be wrong to bring our proceedings to a close without thanking you for the excellent way in which you have chaired our deliberations, sometimes late into the night, and for the generous way in which you have tolerated hon. Members on both sides who have sometimes strayed far from order. I should like to thank the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg), who has also presided over our proceedings with great aplomb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the Clerk, Mr. Gerhold, who has sat these many hours with us and never appeared tired or bored by our proceedings. I also thank the attendants, 	<i>Hansard</i> and the policemen, particularly those who joined us in our all-night and all-morning sitting. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) for everything he has done, and not done, and for what he is about to do. All Committee members and all staff will be welcome to join us on the Terrace later for refreshments, for which my hon. Friend will be footing the Bill—the proceedings of which are open-ended. I hope also that members of the press will join us, in exchange for not reporting the fact that Opposition Members will be seen drinking glasses of champagne with Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Champagne?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, my hon. Friend is a generous man. I should also thank the hon. Member for Fife, Central for the way in which he has conducted the Opposition, for the good humour and tolerance that he has shown, often when sorely provoked, and for the orderly way in which we have carried out our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one further piece of unfinished business, thanks to the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), which is the outstanding matter of the 1883 examination paper. I received four scripts—one each from my hon. Friends the Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes—for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1500</span>
Gainsborough and Horncastle and for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), and from the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). Those scripts have all been marked. I have arranged for the answers to be on the table. They have been completed by Her Majesty's chief inspector, with great aplomt)—he even found a mistake in the question paper. It is an interesting record, including Gaelic, Latin and Greek translations. None of the papers presented attempted any of the translation, and I was disappointed that the frontrunner, the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), who could have done the Gaelic, did not submit a paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong of me to report the results to the Committee. I shall be arranging for the information to sent to the families concerned. It will be kept in confidence. There is no question of the results being made public, or used to form league tables or being posted for the notice of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Sir M. Fox) has assured me that the results will not be used to determine selection and eligibility for the future Standing Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members are all wondering who had the most successful entry. Not a single entry achieved the necessary 10 per cent. requirement contained in the Bill for the ballot procedure—all scored less than 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes asked me to make available a bottle of whisky to those who were successful. By generous donation from Robertson and Baxter, I have a 17-year-old Glengoyne whisky made in my constituency. I have great pleasure in telling the Committee that that whisky will go the the hon. Member for Moray. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, who is not present, was a close second, but I had to knock 10 marks off his score. Although he got the date of the battle of Stirling Bridge right, he thought that the English had won.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude my remarks on that jolly note, but I thank you again, Mr. Martin, for the way that you have chaired our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I am not sure whose reputation has been damaged most by the Minister's concluding remarks. I echo his sentiments about the quality of your Chairmanship, Mr. Martin, and I also extend our good wishes to your co-Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg). I am also grateful for the support services provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often apparent that I do not have a warm and close relationship with the Minister. Nevertheless, I admire the qualities that he has brought as leader of the Government's programme for education and health services in Scotland. I admire the commitment that he has to his politics, and he has spent long hours in the Committee—my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has spelt out to me the time that we have spent on the proceedings—with great thoroughness and to great effect. The Opposition give him grudging admiration for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>1501</span>
Being in Opposition is a frustration in itself. Despite the crumbs that the Minister has kindly conceded during the Committee, this remains a uniquely objectionable Bill. However, politics is about winning and the Government have a majority. We look forward to the time in the not-too-distant future when we can consider Scottish education from a different perspective. Some parts of the Bill might remain: some parts of it might be popular. It would be foolish for anyone to commit any Government of any political party to what they will do in two or three years' time. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) should not chuckle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition team are new to the House. We were all elected in 1987 and, in its widest sense, the Committee has been an educational experience for us and some Conservative Members. The debate has sometimes been bitter and acrimonious, and sometimes it has been of high quality. This week, we have discussed sensitive issues and the true value of the Committee stage has come to the fore. The Government have managed to get the Bill to Report and Third Reading, but we shall continue to oppose it. A campaign will begin on the future of Scottish education in the 1990s and up to the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you, Mir. Martin, and Conservative Members. We have enjoyed the experience and I am sure that we shall do battle in other Committees in the years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I add my thanks to you, Mr. Martin, and to the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) for the courtesy that you have shown me from the Chair. I also thank the Clerk and 	<i>Hansard,</i> which has struggled from time to time with our accents and our phraseology, but which has done an excellent job in recording what not all would regard as our words of wisdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard work to be the sole representative of a party and it can be lonely. I thought of asking my hon. Friends the Members for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) and for Glasgow, Go van (Mr. Sillars) to come back and join me, but that might have caused a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to play a constructive part but, the feeling exists within the Scottish National party and other political parties in Scotland that many Scottish Members have been denied the right to participate in the detailed discussions on an important Bill. We shall see the repercussions of that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1502</span>
I recommend that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) read "The Scottish Realm". It is a useful book, which not only points out who won which battle but, refers to the democratic intellect of Scotland and the Scottish attitude towards politicians, which has developed over the years. I have enjoyed some of my work in this Committee. Some of it has been stimulating, and some of it less than stimulating—that is perhaps the kindest way to describe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather like taking coals to Newcastle for the hon. Member for Moray to take a bottle of whisky home, as that area has 43 distilleries. I suspect that the people who marked the papers will have drawn up a record of my needs. I am worried about the report card that will be sent to my husband and mother. I am glad that my work as a Sunday school teacher has not been wasted and perhaps studying history at a Scottish university also helped me. I hope that we have proved that Scottish education is the best in the United Kingdom. I shall donate the bottle of whisky to one of the many charities in my constituency that work with children With special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their kind remarks. I shall ensure that my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mr. Hogg) is informed of them. It is not usual for the Chairmanship of a Committee to attract attention in the press. Although members of the Committee have made kind remarks, others have called for my resignation. I must be the first Chairman of a Committee to be described as an Uncle Tom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee had a bumpy start but it has been a pleasure to be in the Chair. I recall our long sitting when I thought of the words of a more experienced Chairman who said, "You don't have to be daft to be a Chairman, but it helps." At 7 am, his words were ringing true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank the police officers, members of the Serjeant at Arms department, the members of the public who have attended our sittings, the members of the press who have taken an interest and 	<i>Hansard,</i> which has been so helpful. As the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said, some of the towns mentioned were not easy to spell and I do not think that many of us could spell them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
