<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>[continuation from col. 538] 9.15 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before our sitting was suspended, I was drawing the Committee's attention to the novel practice of Opposition Members tabling amendments to give themselves the opportunity to speak and vote against them. The action of Opposition Members was not a deliberate intention; it happened by accident rather than by design. It was a little like what happened to Lord Lucan. Our Henry and the Labour brigade are now riding valiantly into the Valley of Doubt as a result of their tabling an amendment that many Labour Members did not have the opportunity to discuss or examine. We had expected that their argument would at least be consistent.<br><br>
That explains why the Opposition Front Bench was facing problems. For whatever reason, it tabled an amendment that was identical to amendment No. 174, then tabled another amendment—amendment No. 37—and faced various directions at the same time. That left Opposition Back-Bench Members to follow their version of Lord Lucan into the Valley of Doubt. I do not know whether the canons were firing to the left or right. But from the Opposition's interventions, especially from their Front Bench, with the exception of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), I am certain that their position was not clear and consistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said that the tabling of the amendment was a mistake on our part. We realised the error and withdrew the amendment from the amendment paper. I apologise for the inconvenience that that caused the Committee. On reflection, that genuine mistake can possibly be put down to my inexperience. We appreciated that it was inconsistent with our main amendment, which would delete prescription by regulation. I wish to put our official point of view on the record and to help out the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a useful intervention. At least we now know the background to the muddle. It would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has accepted the responsibility for the mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) was about to leave the subject, so I do not think that we should pursue it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what my hon. Friend was about to say, so I cannot respond to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was about to say to the hon. Member that it was time that he left that subject, so I hope that the intervention is not on that subject. The point has been made. A mistake was made, and the matter has been belaboured for several hours. We should now get back to amendment No. 174.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. We are all anxious to make progress in Committee. Would not life have been much easier if, five hours ago, when I asked a straight question of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), he had given a straight answer? He would not have wasted five hours of the Committee's time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Life would be much easier if hon. Members took the advice of the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping, Mr. Martin, that you would recognise that I was pursuing the standard practice in the House of Commons. When an hon. Member declares that he has erred, the House is usually forgiving and understanding. I was trying to make that clear, before my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) intervened. If that were the only error in the amendments that we are discussing, one would say that any of us could make a mistake and all of us will at some time. We would hope that hon. Members would be gracious in accepting our acknowledgement, and I do so. In that respect, the matter is ended.<br><br>
What about the splendid relationship between Opposition Members and the media, and the accounts given in the Scottish press about what the amendments are supposed to contain? That is relevant because the Committee must place on record the facts as we see them, for those who have a deep and abiding interest in the well-being of Scottish education, including all those who sent suggestions on amendments as well as Conservative Members. When one reads an official press release that is all at sixes and sevens, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said, that shows clearly that matters have not been thought through carefully— for example, the case of schools with fewer than 300 pupils.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central gave the impression that he was deliberately excluding secondary schools and tabling an amendment that involved only primary schools. That is clearly what the amendment said. When one listened to the hon. Gentleman, however, it was clear that, in his view,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0313">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
the legislation was principally designed to affect secondary schools. He obviously did not consider it important or necessary to include secondary schools. If the amendment were accepted, it would remove 1,900 of Scotland's primary schools. It would be a wrecking amendment, as my hon. Friend the Minister said.<br><br>
We have heard about Conservative Members' views of the effect that the amendment would have on Scottish primary schools, especially in rural areas. I must declare an interest, because all my primary schools are in what can best be described as a rural area. I want them to have the same opportunities as any other primary school. If they believe that they can operate better as self-governing schools because it gives them choice, I want them to have the opportunity to make that choice. If I am asked whether I would prefer them to go down that route, the anwer is that I would prefer the local authority to run its education business in such a manner that there would be no question of any of my rural schools wishing to pursue that course of action.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) drew attention to problems in Dundee. Anyone who thinks that the education policy as practised by Tayside will not affect rural areas is not living in the real world. The rural areas are greatly affected by the problems of Dundee because, like all central magnetic forces, it tends to suck in resources. Alternatively, it affects planning and strategic thinking in such a way that the entire rural area feels its impact. In those circumstances, my primary and secondary schools may feel that one benefit of the Bill is that the local authority will at least see that there is a threat of schools considering the possibility of becoming self-governing.<br><br>
Such pressure is essential to provide checks and balances so that sparsely populated rural areas can have the leverage and pressure that they should have but lack because of their small numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I to take it that the hon. Gentleman is not in favour of schools in Tayside opting out and merely wants the legislation to go on the statute book so that it can be used as a threat against the education authority in Tayside?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never made any bones about my position in regard to the Bill. I should have preferred that we did not have to go down this road, but bitter experience has taught me that my constituency comes pretty low on the list of priorities of the decision-makers in Dundee. One reason is that although my constituency returns a substantial majority of Conservative councillors in the region— far more than those of other political parties and, certainly, there are no Labour councillors—we are governed by an authority which is less than responsive and helpful. Therefore, we have to find ways of creating pressure to endure that consideration will be given to the needs of rural areas.<br><br>
That is why I believe that the amendment that refers to schools with fewer than 300 pupils would affect a substantial number of schools in my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 542</span>
constituency. I would not like my schools to be denied the right to choice, but if any of my schools were to go down that route I would give it my enthusiastic support. However, I hope that it will not happen.<br><br>
I wish to dispel any myth that the Opposition may believe about the views of Conservative Members on the state education system. To suggest that we have set out to destroy that system is to ignore where most of us from Scotland were educated. That factor is important as we have direct experience; all my children have been educated in the state education system. It was not that I could not afford to send my children to private education but, as a matter of policy, I believed that my children and I should know exactly what was going on in my constituency. That is fundamental to what I believe although others may not share my views and attitudes. However, I defend the right of all parents to choose the sort of education they want for their children. I exercised my right and if others, want to send their children to private schools I will give them my full support. If parents and school boards choose to make their schools self-governing, they will have my full support because I believe that choice should be open to all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman says that choice should be open to all. He has argued persistently in favour of Tayside education authority closing comprehensive schools in Dundee and removing choice from the parents who wish to use those schools.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that a large number of schools in my constituency have been closed. At no time did I try to prevent those closures. I have always argued that there is a level at which one wastes scarce resources—teachers, buildings and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the provisions of the Bill would be wrecked by this amendment which sets out to destroy the opportunity for choice. If we accepted the amendment with the limit of 300 pupils, schools in my area would have no choice. To suggest that that means that I am not prepared to see schools close is contrary to all that I have practised as a Member of Parliament in my constituency. More schools have been closed in my constituency than in that of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). I did not oppose any of the closures, because the parents and I had discussed the viability of the schools and the opportunities for children in rural areas. We wanted to do our best for the children. That is what education is all about; it is about children, not buildings and staff, which are the means by which we educate children. We have to make sure that education is provided for children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he believes that there is a level below which resources
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0314">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 543</span>
are wasted. What does he consider to be the ideal size for primary and for secondary schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The ideal size in my constituency is different from that in an inner city. The hon. Gentleman asks a nonsensical question. In my constituency there is a primary school with one teacher and its optimum numbers of pupils would be 12 or 13. It works extremely well. That would not occur in the inner cities, because there the problem is different. The hon. Gentleman should think carefully about the questions that he puts because he has, sadly, some inhibitions that may be the result of his background, experience and education. Those inhibitions might in other circumstances be declared as an interest. All of us who have a special interest in some subject are often influenced by cases of which we have no direct experience. The example that I have given of schools closing where the local community recognises—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a minute. He should not be so impetuous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Once again, may I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are dealing with the issue of special schools. An amendment is before us and we should be discussing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was discussing an amendment about a school with fewer than 300 pupils. I must follow the strictures of the Chair. I would love to debate the detail of the question with the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall).<br><br>
We have heard very different views on the amendment on special schools. The letter from the constituent of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), Mrs. Aileen K. Lamont was most interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not how it should be pronounced; the hon. Gentlemen should know better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I know is that in Dundee they say one thing, and in another part of Tayside they say another, and both refer to the same person. There are families living next door to each other in my constituency who both spell their names Menzies but pronounce it in different ways. Part of Scotland's problem is that, being tribal, names are pronounced in different ways in different areas.<br><br>
Whatever the lady's name, the important point is the contents of her letter. It spelt out clearly why we should give the same opportunities to special schools. I have some knowledge of such schools, as I am sure do all hon. Members. Very few of us do not have a constituency interest in that matter. None of us wishes to create impediments to the wellbeing and education of children and the wellbeing of parents.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray put her finger on the important ingredient—the parents of children with such problems are already directly involved in their children's education. They, above all others, will treat
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
seriously the question of whether a school should take the opportunity under the amendment that my hon. Friend said he would accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that under the Education (Scotland) Act 1981 the choice already exists for parents? There is no strict zoning in the placement of children with special needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a parent who made use of the provisions in that Act, I accept that. But what is not included in that Act and would be included in the Bill if the amendment were accepted is the opportunity for a local school that meets those needs—some schools in my constituency do so—to become self-governing. The parents of children with such problems are committed and involved, and if they believed that that was against the interests of the school, I am confident that it would not happen. But they may be convinced that it should happen. I want them to have the choice, and that is why I support amendment No. 174.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I used to wonder why Members of Parliament have a bad reputation with the population. Since coming to the House I have met Members of Parliament of outstanding character from both sides of the House. But having witnessed some of the scenes on the Conservative Benches today and the disgraceful behaviour of Conservative Members, I realise why Members of Parliament have a bad reputation. I shall not go into the various matters that were raised by Conservative Members because I have a professional standard of behaviour from which I cannot deviate. It is certainly not my practice to drag handicapped children through the Committee and to laugh at them and joke about them to make political points and make merriment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way.<br><br>
The behaviour of Conservative Members created the most disgraceful scenes that I have ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to mislead the Committee to believe that he was here for a large part of our proceedings, when he was not here for much of the day—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is not misleading the Committee. No hon. Gentleman seeks to mislead the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that Conservative Members do not want to hear about their behaviour, but I shall ensure that people outside the House hear about it. Their cynical use of mental handicap as a jest and a source of fun in the Committee is probably the most despicable behaviour that I have seen since I came to the House. I refer, or course, to the letter mentioned by the hon. Member for Brigg and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0315">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 545</span>
Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). Without previously mentioning it to the constituency Member of Parliament he rushed in to make cheap jibes about it. Without checking the background he sought to use the letter for political ends. I have looked into the facts.<br><br>
The writer, Mrs. Lamont, was surprised that a private letter should be aired in public without her consent. [An hon. Member: Shocking.] I agree. It was the sort of disgraceful behaviour to which the Opposition would never stoop. Mrs. Lamont tells me that she is a member of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council and teaches at a private school in my constituency—Glasgow High. I asked her why she did not write to the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), but she said that she had never heard of him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that a cheap jibe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Lamont said that she had been told by a contact to write a letter to the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes for use in connection with the Committee, but she would not divulge who that contact was. The hon. Gentleman sought to threaten me by reading out a letter from one of my constituents, as though I should be worrying about my re-election prospects. I have to tell the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes that the way that we work in Scotland—certainly the way that I work in my constituency—is to stand by principles. The constituents have to make a choice based on those principles.<br><br>
There is a more important reason why I do not feel threatened by the letter: it is not from one of my constituents. The address, 18 Beech Avenue, Bearsden, is not in my constituency. It reflects the utter incompetence of Conservative Members that they cannot even get the constituency right. They are so keen to rush in and use handicapped children to sneer and make fun that they cannot even get the constituency right, and they make utter fools of themselves. But there are more serious issues here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sit down.<br><br>
On a point of order, Mr. Martin. First I should like to know whether it would be in order for the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes to give me an unreserved apology for what he has said. I should also like your guidance on the hon. Gentleman's standards of behaviour and etiquette. Was his behaviour correct? Has he breached any parliamentary standards by raising the letter without discussing it with the constituency Member concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The constituency Member is my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington).<br><br>
The third matter on which I would like your ruling, Mr. Martin, is the way in which the hon. Gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 546</span>
misled the Committee by saying that the letter was from someone in the constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden when that was not true. In particular I am concerned because outside agencies have sought to mislead the House and influence our work here by devious means. That is a serious matter, Mr. Martin, and I ask for your ruling on whether it should be pursued further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are times when an hon. Member may mislead the House, but the important distinction is that no hon. Member should deliberately mislead the House. As for the conventions of the House, it is usually proper for some warning to be given if an hon. Member is to be criticised. However, that is not a matter for the Chair. In this case, the letter was not from the hon. Gentleman's constituent, but from the constituent of an hon. Member who is not serving on this Committee. I gave the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) the opportunity to reply because his name was linked with the letter as being the constituency Member of Parliament. He has put the record right as far as he is concerned.<br><br>
I hope that as the matter has been laid to rest, we can now discuss the amendment.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I fully accept your ruling, but you did not touch on whether outside influences have been used to influence and mislead the Committee. I detect the dirty hands of the Tory party all over this. I am concerned that outside influences have sought to mislead the Committee and abuse the House. I should like your ruling on that, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Deliberately misleading the House is a matter for the Committee of Privileges, not for me. The hon. Gentleman knows that facilities are available to raise any matter about which he may be concerned. As the Chairman of this Committee, I have no powers in respect of such problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on what the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said about the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I take it that the hon. Gentleman is raising a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a contribution to the continuing debate, Mr. Martin. I believe that we are still discussing the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Has the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden finished his point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that you have ruled that I can pursue the matter with the Committee of Privileges, Mr. Martin, and I intend to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not given that ruling. I have just said that the facilities are available to any hon. Member. I have not instructed the hon.

Gentleman to pursue the matter in that way. I do not have any powers in the matter. The hon. Gentleman was speaking to amendment No. 174. Has he completed his contribution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Is the Committee at least entitled to an apology from the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, who raised the matter, wrongly attributed it to my constituency and made accusations against me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman was mentioned as the constituency Member of Parliament and his name was linked to the letter. Whether he apologises is entirely up to the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). I have no powers in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I advised my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was the constituency Member of Parliament for Bearsden and that the letter probably came from someone in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. My hon. Friend read out the letter's address and post code twice at the beginning of his speech. If the letter did not come from the hon. Gentleman's constituency, he had the opportunity to correct my hon. Friend then and there, but he did not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish to pursue the matter, but whether an hon. Member apologises is a personal decision. That was the point of order. The record will show that the name of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was mentioned in connection with the letter. There is an onus on hon. Members to check whether the constituency is the correct one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin, I seek your guidance on serious matters such as references to individuals and constituencies. Mention is often made in Committee to a constituency and the hon. Member. I constantly have to tell people that I do not represent the city of Perth. We have had a substantial element of pious humbug about that, because one of the problems that hon. Members have to face is that the boundaries are not always in line with the addresses, and, therefore, mistakes can be made almost every day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly not a point of order, but it may highlight the fact that if hon. Members were able to stick to the amendment, they would not get into this situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Maclean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Penrith and The Border)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put, <i>but</i> <b>The Chairman</b> <i>withheld his assent, and declined then to put that Question.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall not castigate the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes for failing to withdraw and to apologise because I want to get on with the debate.<br><br>

I simply wish to ask the Minister about special needs education. If a special needs school were to opt out, what control would the board of management have over the special needs provision within that school? There is often controversy about the value of various forms of management within special schools. Will management be a matter for the education authority, the Secretary of State or the school itself? For example, would it be possible for an opted-out special school to introduce conductive education if it wished? I do not wish to prejudge the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the issue is important, which it clearly is, why was he absent from the debate for about two hours? It was known from 1 o'clock that the debate would start at 4.30 pm. If the matter is so important to the hon. Gentleman, where was he?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was absent for an hour and 15 minutes, not for two hours. The hon. Gentleman knows that some of us have to deal with other important issues. I do not see all Conservative members of the Committee present all the time, nor is the hon. Gentleman always here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I concede that, but the question still stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is a silly one, but if the hon. Gentleman cannot even get my constituency right, I cannot expect him to be smart enough to raise significant points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that we are getting into the later hours, but hon. Members should give others a hearing when they have the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I wanted to be brief so as to move the debate on. I hope that the Minister understands my point that controversy might arise about the value of various forms of management of pupils in special schools. Will it be possible for the boards of management to make decisions, and if they wish, introduce conductive education? If the Scottish Office or an education authority thought that conductive education was of no value, how would such matters be decided, because it is almost the equivalent of the curriculum for children in special schools?<br><br>
How will physiotherapy and occupational therapy be managed within special schools? In her letter, the lady, who is not my constituent, says that one of the problems is the lack of speech therapists. They are provided not by the education authority but by the health board. The more that one reads that letter, the more confused it appears to be.<br><br>
I presume that the relationships will still stand, but who will make the decisions about the provision of speech therapists? Will decisions be made centrally, or locally by the education authority, and what special influence will the boards of management have? I want the Minister to respond to those points.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As somebody who has been present throughout this debate, I am glad that the Government have seen sense and not tried again to force the closure of the debate. Several issues remain to be discussed before we press the amendment to a Division. I do not want to become involved in the controversy over the points of order relating to the letter, but the least that can be said is that a grave discourtesy has been inflicted on the Member of Parliament who represents Mrs. Lamont's constituency. His constituent's case has been dragged through this Committee with no attempt to consult him about the rights and wrongs of such behaviour.<br><br>
More importantly, Mrs. Lamont has suffered a grave discourtesy. Permission to use her letter in such a public forum was not sought and not given. That reflects the tone in which the debate has been conducted in the past three or four hours and that tone is wrong for a debate of such seriousness. That point has been made already, particularly by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). We are dealing with a serious issue; hon. Members should debate the arguments and not use them for political buffoonery and knockabout, and party political attacks against both sides. This serious issue has so far not been debated as seriously as it should have been.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to present the letter as private. The letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was copied to me and was clearly written to contribute to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) was given a copy of the letter which had at the top:
<br><blockquote><p><i>"CC</i> Rt Hon. M. Forsyth".</p></blockquote>
I do not know why the hon. Gentleman expresses surprise because my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes read that out to the Committee some hours ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One learns something new with every minute that passes. We know now that the Minister was involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that we should return to the letter. We have had enough of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we should not return to whether the letter should be used in the Committee, but it would be fair to refer to how the letter's content contributed to whether the amendment should be supported. We were told that Mrs. Lamont comes from Bearsden, but we now discover that she comes from nearer Clydebank and Milngavie. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) said that her letter proved that there was a genuine case in support of amendment No. 174. That case revolved round Mrs. Lamont believing that it was Strathclyde regional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
council's policy to integrate children with special educational needs into mainstream education while those who could not be integrated into normal schools should attend day centres. She took offence at that strategy of the education authority and decided that the solution would be to allow the school which her child attends to opt out of education authority control.<br><br>
The strategy of Strathclyde regional council was laid down in the Warnock report, in its recommendations for the education of children with special needs and that strategy is non-controversial. Individuals will disagree with the findings of the Warnock report and with the policies and strategies pursued by education authorities—Mrs. Lamont is an example. That hardly justifies an overpowering argument in favour of allowing special schools to opt out of education authority control. The school to which Mrs. Lamont sends her child is in Cumbernauld. She is one parent—children from all over Glasgow presumably attend that school. Nobody knows what are the views of the parents of those children. One cannot base the justification for special schools opting out on one letter from one constituent to one Member of Parliament. That is a false argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of the lady's letter was that of an individual parent who was essentially backing up—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.15 pm <i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we broke for the Division, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) had kindly given way to me. For the convenience of the Committee, I shall repeat the simple point that I was making. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the importance of the letter that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) read to the Committee is that it was a concrete, individual example of the general case for amendment No. 174 which has been put to all members of the Committee by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of the intervention that he was making 15 minutes ago. He said that the importance of the letter that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) brought to the Committee's attention was that it was a single example of a general case. It was the only case that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes brought forward. The rest of his speech was entirely connected with the procedural methods for tabling amendments in Committee. The only thing he brought forward that was relevant to whether special schools should be allowed to opt out was the letter. If I produced a single letter from someone who is opposed to the poll tax, I hope that the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 551</span>
for Brigg and Cleethorpes, and every one else, would support me in suggesting that the Government withdraw the poll tax in Scotland. Of course they would not do that, and they cannot seriously expect the Opposition to support their arguments on the basis of a single letter especially since only part of it was read out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read the whole letter. As I said earlier, it arrived in my post at 1 o'clock. I read it all out, including the address and the name, and I drew to the Committee's attention the fact that it had been sent to my hon. Friend the Minister.<br><br>
I gave the letter to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) who, like me, presumably thought that it was from one of his constituents. Of course, we all know that it was not from one of his constituents. He did not know that; I did not know that. I said that it was probably from his constituency. I read the whole letter—every single word of it—out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I accept that he read out the entire letter. I only wish that he had taken the care to consult and to find out which constituency the lady came from so that he could have done the usual courtesy of approaching the Member of Parliament for that constituency and informing him that he intended to raise the letter publicly in the Committee. He did not do that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be gracious enough to seek out the appropriate Member of Parliament and apologise to him for the unfair way in which he raised the letter of his constituent in the Committee. The important point is, exactly what arguments contained in the letter could be relevant to whether the amendment should be supported. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes argued for it and the Minister has suggested that he intends to accept the amendment.<br><br>
Other than Mrs. Lamont expressing the view that she did not want her child to be educated in line with the recommendations of the Warnock report, her argument, as I recall it, was that she thought special schools were being denied resources by the directorate of Strathclyde region. If Conservative Members accept that Mrs. Lamont's accusation is true and that Glencryan special school is being denied resources by the education authority, the Minister should investigate the circumstances in which Strathclyde education authority is funding the school.<br><br>
However, that does not justify the Minister and the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes using the letter as a club to beat party political points. If Conservative Members are really concerned that Strathclyde education authority is not distributing resources fairly to the schools under its control, it is a matter to take up with the authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be useful to fax a copy of the letter tomorrow morning to Mr. Frank Pinatelli, the director of education in Strathclyde, so that we can receive a full report on the lady's problems and on the school? Is that not reasonable?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a reasonable idea. I do not know why Conservative Members did not take such an initiative when they received the letter. If I received a letter complaining about the way in which an education authority was treating a school, I should try to find out the facts behind the allegations. I receive letters all the time that make allegations; sometimes they are against Ministers and sometimes they are against other individuals. The first thing an hon. Member should do is check out the facts. He should not rush into the public domain and use the allegations for his own narrow party political ends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), I took the time to speak to Mrs. Lamont. I understand that one of her fears is that the school might close. I looked into that and I understand that it is not the case. When we write to Mr. Pinatelli, we could ask for an assurance from him so that we can allay those fears. That is the appropriate way in which to deal with the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. As we debate the matter, we see that there is little substance in the case put forward by Conservative Members in support of amendment No. 174. It was all bluster, with nothing behind it. I accept that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) tried to argue the merits of the amendment—the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) made some attempt to do that too—but other Conservative Members showed no interest in the amendment. Their aim was to use it to attack the Labour party and Labour members of the Committee. I find that very sad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Member for Eastwood jumping up and down, but I do not remember him taking part in the debate. Perhaps he spoke many hours ago and I have forgotten, such was the brilliance of his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not recall my speech. His hon. Friends on the Front Bench would not be able to recall it because they were not here to listen to it. They could not take the heat.<br><br>
During my speech, I made the case for the amendment, which was put to all members of the Committee by the SPTC. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the allegation that my hon. Friends and I did not take the amendment seriously. It was not unreasonable to read the contents of the letter to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is never unreasonable to make a case to the Committee. If the hon. Member for Eastwood says that he did that, and I accept his point. I was not referring to him. However, whether the hon. Gentleman does or does not contribute, the effect on me is the same. I forget what he said or did not say within half an hour. Such is the brilliance and logic of his argument that it completely passes over me and I forget it. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes made a long speech, but he did not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 553</span>
make out a case other than to read out the letter. The hon. Member for Ipswich also tried to make party political points. Only the hon. Member for Tayside, North attempted to deal with the arguments. Even the Minister made little reference to the arguments, other than to say that he would accept the amendment, but he had a political knockabout in the process.<br><br>
It is important that we deal with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood if he will make an intelligent intervention. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Dunnachie) said, the hon. Gentleman comes in and out of the Committee like gas on a peep. He has not followed our debates very closely. It had better be an important point, or it will be the last time that I give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an important point. The hon. Gentleman castigated my hon. Friend for quoting from a letter that he had received which referred to matters that are before this Committee and provided an example upon which we might deliberate and come to a conclusion. The hon. Gentleman is adopting a holier than thou attitude to this matter. On the Electricity Bill and in a wider context, the Labour party survives almost exclusively on leaked documents that are not even in the public domain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation to talk about leaked documents and whether people called Ingham and Powell are to be given Government protection for leaking documents or whether they are to be pursued as others have been for that offence. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want to debate that issue, and nor does the Committee.<br><br>
The letter suggests that Strathclyde regional council is discriminating against a special school. The hon. Member for Ipswich made it clear that it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that education authorities treat every school the same. He suggested that legislation might be necessary and the Minister nodded his head in agreement. When we consider a concrete case of an education authority that may not be treating all schools the same, however, there is no attempt to deal with the problem and no legislation. Instead, it is exploited for narrow party political ends by Conservative Members. That is regrettable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman checks the amendment paper he will find an amendment in my name which would meet the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to the debate on that amendment. I hope that it is at a higher level than this debate because the way in which Conservative Members have treated this amendment is shocking. That is an argument in favour of televising Parliament. Conservative support in Scotland would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
be wiped out if the Scottish people saw the deplorable behaviour of Conservative Members, with only a few honourable exceptions. I shall give way to one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has had the worst of the argument and he knows it. That is why he is whingeing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention is indicative of our different approaches. When we argue the case for the amendment, we are accused of whingeing, when Conservative Members debate procedural methods for tabling amendments they claim that they are winning the argument. We want to deal with the arguments properly, unlike the Conservative Members. It is important that at least the Opposition debate the issues at stake.<br><br>
The Minister said that he had originally intended to take a cautious approach to this matter because he envisaged great problems if special schools were allowed to opt out of education authority control. That is why, having consulted his civil servants and presumably people who are active in special schools and special education, the Minister decided that it was better to be cautious and to exclude special schools provided that, later, when the matter had been thoroughly investigated, it might be possible to bring forward parliamentary regulations which would allow special schools to opt out.<br><br>
After a deplorable debate, which sank to the very depths of the worst in Parliament, the Minister changed his mind and decided to go for the incautious approach and to include the amendment in the Bill. Without consulting his civil servants or the people who deal with special education, he listened to the atrocious speech of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes and decided to accept the amendment. It is quite deplorable for any Minister to behave in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that my hon. Friend the Minister caught your eye, Mr. Martin, and said that he would accept the amendment before he heard my speech and was persuaded by the arguments that I deployed.</span></p>
<p>10.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the only argument that the hon. Member deployed was to read out a letter, a copy of which the Minister already had, that intervention is hardly convincing. The Minister knew what the hon. Member had to say: he had already read it in the copy of the letter which he confirmed had been passed to him before the Committee met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the letter says that it has been copied to me I had not seen or heard its contents until my hon. Friend read it out to the Committee. It is wrong to suggest otherwise. However, I had the benefit of a long meeting with the SPTC last Friday which affected my stance on the amendment which it put forward and to which the hon. Gentleman at one time put his name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is revealing. Early this morning, when I moved an amendment which had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
been suggested by the SPTC, the hon. Member for Tayside, North erupted and said that it was garbage. Now we find that the Minister was in close liaison with the SPTC and believes everything its members tell him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that it would create legislative constitutional garbage. That was the point that I was making. If the hon. Gentleman quotes me he must do so exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to seeing how <i>Hansard</i> reports the hon. Member. He said nothing of the kind. He said that the amendment was garbage. I wrote it down because I was so surprised that anyone should make such an outrageous statement about the SPTC's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the plot thickens? The Minister met the SPTC on Friday and a contact then tells a member of the SPTC to send a letter to the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr Brown).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. My advice a few hours ago was to get away from this letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow your advice, Mr. Martin, and get away from the letter. The Minister conceded earlier that diagnosis and assessment of a child's special educational needs must operate on other than an individual school basis. He conceded that it should properly lie with the education authority in the form of the regional council. He also conceded that responsibility for the record of needs should lie with the education authority. When he responds, I hope that he will say where that record of needs will be kept and whether the school will have access to it, and explain just what responsibility the school and the education authority will have for it.<br><br>
The Minister seems to be saying that the self-governing school will have no responsibility for keeping any kind of record of needs of the children in its charge and that it will lie completely with the education authority, but we know from the Bill that once a self-governing school has opted out, it can change the characteristics of the school and establish admission criteria. It is strange to conceive that a school could accept or exclude individual children when the responsibility for those children will remain with the education authority, which will keep the record of needs. Exactly how that will work is not clear. I hope that the Minister will explain the extent of the responsibility and obligation on the self-governing school and on the education authority.<br><br>
By saying that responsibility will lie with the education authority rather than the opted-out school, the Minister seemed to suggest that he accepted that opted-out special schools must depend on the education authority to enable them to continue to operate as special schools. The Minister will concede that special schools could not survive or provide a wide range of special education provision without support. The child psychology service and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
educational social workers, for example, must continue to be supplied by the education authority.<br><br>
The staff in any school that decides to opt out will not necessarily accept the decision. What will happen if the majority—or even a significant minority—of staff in a special school decide that they cannot work in a self-governing school but would prefer to remain under the education authority, and the education authority agrees to transfer them?<br><br>
Another worrying issue is that the education authority may decide that it can no longer guarantee that it can place children with special needs in a school that decides to opt out, as control of admission to the school will lie with the school rather than the education authority. The education authority may then decide to make further provision and set up another special school which would mirror the provision previously available in the now opted-out school. Many of the staff may decide to transfer from the opted-out school. Does the Bill deal with such circumstances?<br><br>
Unfortunately, those matters have not been debated because of the lack of Conservative Members' concern. Nor has the Minister dealt with the control of staff.<br><br>
Although the education authority will be responsible for keeping the record of needs for individual pupils in self-governing schools, how can it ensure that schools meet those needs? How are the education authority's specialist staff, who know the children's requirements, supposed to monitor what goes on inside the school when there is no place on the board of management for members of the education authority, the child psychology service, the social work department, or for any such body with a direct interest? Must they simply trust the board of management to meet the pupils' needs? The board of management will control staff appointments, the curriculum, provision of grants, special access, general standards, discipline, and whether the education provided is suitable for the pupils.<br><br>
I taught for many years in a list D school. For the benefit of English members of the Committee, list D schools are equivalent to approved schools in England. They had the same relationship with the education authority as the Minister suggests self-governing schools should have. Standards in list D schools vary enormously. The education authority social work service group in Edinburgh had no control over what happened inside the school, as they were controlled by independent boards of management.<br><br>
I visited one school for boys where the pupils were put across a desk, had their trousers pulled down and were beaten across the buttocks with a leather belt. At another school, where there was no corporal punishment, there was a tremendous atmosphere. A headmaster told me that during his first night at a school he heard nothing but screaming from terrified girls. He managed to turn the school around and the children with special needs had their needs met compassionately and positively. That was an exception. In many schools, physical punishment and terror continued because they were run independently by boards of management, and the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
central authorities—the education authority or the Scottish Office—did not control what happened in them. There is no provision, either in the amendment or in anything that I have heard from Conservative Members, to suggest that they would be able to control what would happen in special schools that opt out of education authority control. That fills me with alarm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's argument. Is he suggesting that the large number of special schools that are run not by local authorities but by voluntary bodies do not provide the highest standards of care and service? In my experience they do. The implication of what he said is that a school run by a board of management will not be run well. I mentioned some schools run by the Scottish Council for Spastics and other organisations, which set standards that are second to none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. I do not wish to make a party political point out of this issue. I speak from experience, having worked in one list D school in Dundee and having visited many other such schools in Scotland through in-service training. The management structure that operated in those schools and their relationship with the education authority and the Scottish Education Department are similar to those which the Minister proposes for special schools that acquire self-governing status. There may be marvellous provision in most schools but if the abuse that existed in list D schools still exists in even one school, that is justification for us to vote against the amendment. We should not tolerate the abuse of pupils' human rights that I saw in list D schools merely because of ineffective management within the schools.<br><br>
If the Minister and Conservative Back Benchers vote for the amendment, they must be 100 per cent, sure that not one child will suffer as a result of their decision to allow special schools to opt out. Special schools deal with only 2 percent. of Scotland's school population but it is a very important and vulnerable 2 per cent. The Minister and his colleagues must be sure of what they are doing before they play politics with the education and lives of that group of people. I hope that the Minister and, more importantly, the Conservative Members who spoke earlier, will take that on board. We are not dealing with narrow party politics but people's lives and educational experience.<br><br>
The Minister conceded that he saw problems with the funding arrangements that are particular to Scotland. He explained that additional resources would have to be made available but that the need for such resources would fluctuate as the population of such schools fluctuated, as children moved from one school to another or as they improved and no longer required special education. He said that the system of funding, whatever it was, would have to have the capacity to be used flexibly. He asked the Committee to trust him to come up with a system that would ensure that children with special needs received the right education. He did not explain what that structure would be, but the Hooray Henrys
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
on the Conservative Back Benches cheered him on without inquiring whether a system of funding could be found that would be flexible enough to ensure that the concept of special schools opting out would work. That shows the concern of Conservative Back Benchers: they are not worried about the future of special schools or of children with special educational needs. They are more concerned with making cheap, party political points at the expense of such children. That was clear from our debate.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
Another amendment in this group would remove all primary schools with 300 or fewer pupils from the provisions of the clause. That would affect 1,900 primary schools. The hon. Member for Tayside, North and others described it as a wrecking amendment, but Scottish Members would be entirely justified in voting for it. The people of Scotland have given no mandate to the Bill and if the Minister wants schools to be able to opt out—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If and when the Bill becomes law, it will give school boards and parents a choice. The hon. Gentleman says that the Government have no mandate for the Bill, but if there is a choice and the hon. Gentleman is correct, schools will not opt out. So what is he worried about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Throughout our debates, Conservative Members have used the basic argument that this is only permissive legislation to give parents a choice. That is bogus. From the letter quoted earlier in this debate, we know that the lady feared that her child's school would be closed. If the argument is that it is entirely a matter of choice whether a school opts out, while pressure is put on regional councils and education authorities to close some schools, Conservative Members do not know the meaning of "choice". If the only choice is to face closure or amalgamation, or to opt-out, that narrows rather than extends choice, and forces parents to go for self-governing status. That does not mean that they believe in self-governing status.<br><br>
Amendment No. 67 would remove primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils from the provisions of the clause. Apart from the fact that for many schools it would act as wrecking amendment, there are strong arguments in favour of it. There are two schools less than a few hundred yards from my front door—St. Columba's primary school, which my younger son attends, and the smaller St. Margaret's primary school, which is about 250 or 300 yards away. Both are Catholic primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils. If they both opted for self-governing status, they would find themselves in competition not only with the education authority schools, but with each other as they tried to attract Catholic pupils to remain viable as primary schools in their own right.<br><br>
Clearly, the church would have the right to nominate one of its representatives to the board of management of both those schools, but the Church might nominate the same person. It would be absurd if the Church representative was a member of both
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 559</span>
boards of management and had to take part in decisions aimed at attracting pupils away from the other school.<br><br>
One basic consideration is the size at which schools become viable as self-governing or grant-maintained schools, or whatever they are called.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Education and Science believes that primary and secondary schools with fewer than 300 pupils are not viable as grant-maintained schools. He thinks very differently from the Minister, who believes that they are viable and who is anxious that they should be able to opt out of education authority control. The Minister must tell us at what point primary schools will become nonviable as self-governing schools. The Bill provides for the closure of self-governing schools. In the main, before they can be closed, seven years' notice from the Secretary of State for Scotland will be required. If they become non-viable, the Secretary of State can issue them with a warning that if they do not get their act together, he will take steps to close them. If they fail to respond within six months, he can close them, although the Bill does not specify how long it will take him to do so.<br><br>
The provision is important. The Minister must tell the Committee at what point a school, especially a primary school, would become non-viable and would not be allowed to opt out of education authority control. Otherwise, any school whose population is running down can decide to opt out long before the education authority decides to close it. A school will need 10 or 20 per cent, of parents, whatever percentage we decide, to ask for a ballot. A resolution can be passed by the school board for a ballot of parents. The school then submits its proposals to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will have to make up his mind.<br><br>
So far, no one has told us on what basis the decision will be made. If 300 is not the figure below which a school becomes non-viable, will the Minister say what number the amendment should set to prevent primary schools from going through the long process of seeking opted-out status, only to find that when the Secretary of State reads their proposal he says, "Sorry, you're non-viable. You don't have enough pupils. We won't allow you to become an opted-out school."?<br><br>
It is nonsense for the Minister to reject the amendment when he refuses to write a figure into the Bill or to issue any guidance on the level below which schools will become non-sustainable and will not be allowed opted-out status.<br><br>
In its briefing, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities says that as far back as 1918 it was recognised that the limitations of fragmented, inefficient and educationally regressive schools resulting from the old ad hoc system of school boards was unjustifiable. Closure was the only alternative for the boards. A central authority was needed to produce the economics of scale necessary for efficient, coherent and progressive education in all schools. That is why we changed from the school board system to control of schools by education authorities.<br><br>
Now we are moving back to 1918 instead of moving on from 1989. The Minister is suggesting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 560</span>
that we return to fragmented provision through self-governing schools and perhaps to inefficient and regressive education. I can find no suggestion in the Bill that boards of management will necessarily take progressive decisions about the curriculum pursued in their schools or that they will be efficient in their delivery of education.<br><br>
It seems that the opposite will be true. Earlier the hon. Member for Tayside, North and others were keen to argue that it was likely that, unlike education authorities, self-governing schools would be unable even to find out how much it cost them to provide certain further education classes or other education facilities. That in itself suggests that we are talking about a step backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In our debate on clause 11, when rejecting amendment No. 93 which sought to limit the fees and charges made by self-governing schools, the Minister said, "What is wrong with a school making a surplus on such activities?" What are the implications of a special school attempting to make a surplus on such activities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a relevant point. In fact, as I recall, the Minister said that he recommended self-governing schools to try to make a profit out of what was provided.<br><br>
On the subject of schools, the very idea of a special school that is responsible for the education of children with special education needs concentrating on other aspects that might be profitable to that self-governing school, instead of concentrating on the needs of the children who attend the school, is quite abominable. The concept should be repulsive to everyone, yet here we have the Minister who is responsible for education in Scotland recommending those schools to make a profit out of their self-governing status instead of concentrating on providing the best possible service for their pupils. That reeks of hypocrisy, and I find it repulsive that any Minister of the Crown should make such an obscene suggestion to the people who are charged with the responsibility of educating children with special educational needs.<br><br>
There is no democratic expression of popular opinion in Scotland whereby democratic legitimacy could be bestowed on the clause and matter that we are debating. I served on the Committee considering the School Boards (Scotland) Bill as well as this Bill, and I was struck by the way in which the Government's arguments progressed as our deliberations proceeded. We were told, first—by the hon. Member for Eastwood, I think—that school boards were all about the involvement of parents. Now, in this Committee, we are told that self-governing status and opting out are all about choice, but choice that allows parents to remain inside the public sector. There is a steady progression from involving parents to allowing them the choice to remain in the public sector. What will we be told next? At what stage will we hear the argument, "They have the choice to be directly funded within the public education sector. Why do we not give them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 561</span>
the choice to opt out of the public sector and find some source of funding to allow them to become independent"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede that I have always taken the view that there is no inevitable or logical progression from school boards to self-governing schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That always has been the hon. Gentleman's view, but he is of course a Back-Bench Conservative Member and has no direct influence on legislation. But the Minister has that influence, and it cannot be said that he has taken that view throughout. He has always intended to have a logical progression—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood agrees with me, and I am pleased to know that. The Minister has always intended to progress from school boards to self-governing schools, and I am sure that he intends to progress even further. Perhaps he has in mind the voucher system that he and several other hon. Members favoured many years ago but which, up to now, they have been forced to back away from.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the position that I take and that taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) have always been the same. In other words, school boards are about increasing parental involvement in education, and this Bill is about extending parental choice. It is because the Opposition fail to understand that that we have long speeches covering ground that we have covered many times before. It encapsulates the basic difference between the two sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far from failing to understand it, it is precisely what I have just said. Of course the public position taken by the Minister is the same as that taken by the hon. Member for Eastwood, but in private we all know that the Minister's public statements are merely tactical. His underlying beliefs about what should happen to Scottish schools remain secret until he thinks that he has the right context in which to make them public and get away with them, and obviously, he thinks that he can now get away with self-governing schools. I am convinced that at some point, perhaps before the next general election, we shall be back in the Committee debating whether there should be a voucher system to allow people to opt out of the public sector and to buy their education in the private sector. That is the Minister's next logical extension of legislation for the people of Scotland.<br><br>
I shall not flatter the Minister or suggest that he is a Tory Lenin. But he reminds me that, immediately after the first world war, Lenin told the Communists in Britain—they were discussing how they should relate to the social democratic parties such as the Labour party—that they should use those parties and support them in the way that the rope supports the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 562</span>
hanged man. That is how the Minister sees public education in Scotland. He is out to do it down and he will not be happy until it is destroyed. That is why we shall vote against the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a consequence of having accepted amendment No. 174, it is necessary to delete clause 13(8). Amendment No. 97 tabled by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) achieves that aim and although it is an Opposition amendment, I give notice that I intend to move it formally at the proper time.<br><br>
Serious and interesting points were made by members on both sides of the Committee about special schools and I shall respond to as many of them as I can.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) characteristically made the valid point that provision for the small minority of children with special needs, especially in rural areas, calls for a strategic planning by the local authority.<br><br>
I notice that, once again, the Opposition Front Bench is unmanned. It is difficult to respond to debates when that happens.<br><br>
For the benefit of the hon. Member for Fife, Central, I repeat that the hon. Member for Moray said that it was important that local authorities play a part in the strategic planning of services, especially in rural communities. The hon. Member for Moray also said that the special schools are usually small and heavily dependent on visiting specialists. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said that any group proposing that a special school should become self governing should be able to demonstrate that it could muster adequate administrative and professional support and the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) referred especially to the psychological services.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) proposed that the local authority should be compelled to give back-up support to such schools to provide those services. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) drew attention to his amendment No. 71, which we shall discuss later, which probably does what hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich wishes, and I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend's arguments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray mentioned admissions and I shall deal with that matter in a moment.<br><br>
I shall not repeat what has been said about the integrity of the Opposition amendments and the meaning of them but I am puzzled by their insistence that amendment No. 67, which relates to primary schools, would bring the legislation into line with that in England. That is incorrect. The Education Reform Act 1988 enables the Secretary of State for Education and Science to bring down progressively the 300-pupil limit and eliminate it. Contrary to the way in which amendment No. 67 has been promoted in various press releases, it would disadvantage parents and remove the freedom in the Bill that allows them to suggest proposals.<br><br>

My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) made an excellent contribution to the debate. It was so long ago that members of the Committee may have forgotten it. He spelt out for people who will wade through <i>Hansard</i> in the future the philosophical basis for accepting amendment No. 174. It is the same basis that was suggested by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and others. His experience of being a chairman of an education committee put him in a good position to do so.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) referred to a letter and gave us the view of a parent. That letter has turned out to be fairly controversial. The hon. Members for Maryhill and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) took great pains to say that that was the view of only one parent, and asked about the views of a wider audience. A letter dated 10 April from the Scottish Parent Teacher Council was faxed to me yesterday, which I wish to draw to the Committee's attention. I shall not read out the postcode. [Hon. Members: "Why not?"] Because I am anxious to make progress. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Forsyth</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOLS ETC (SCOTLAND) BILL</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Thank you for giving us your time on Friday to discuss our concerns about the Bill. We found it a most useful meeting.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>You indicated a willingness to reconsider the position of special schools and asked me to expand on SPTC's justification to the proposed amendment to Clause 13(2) … Your aim in providing for self-governing schools is to give parents a greater choice of schools. SPTC believes that special schools should have the same opportunity as any other school, to apply for self-governing status. Parents of a child with special educational needs already have a restricted choice, if any at all, as regards which school to place their child in.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Where parents do have any choice of special school or unit, the information that they can obtain about the options available is much more difficult to come by and they are very dependent on the advice and influence of professionals in making their choice. Indeed the choice is usually made by the school as to whether or not to admit the child, rather than the parent choosing the school.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There is a move towards integration into mainstream schools for mildly handicapped children and some authorities have made it their policy to achieve almost total integration. When this policy is implemented, parents are not consulted. Frequently, the change is implemented quietly as children are just not referred, by the authority, to the special school, so that eventually the roll becomes unviable.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Parents of children in special units within mainstream schools frequently feel isolated as they come from a much wider geographical area and have little in common with the parents from the main school and are concerned that their interests may not be adequately represented on the school boards.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Clause 65 of the Bill will allow for children with special educational needs to be admitted to any special schools in England or Wales. This will indeed give parents of such children additional choice. However SPTC believes that the choice could be extended further by allowing special schools in Scotland to apply for self-governing status.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We hope that you and your colleagues will be able to give this issue the consideration it undoubtedly deserves."</p></blockquote>
The general case put by the SPTC backs up convincingly the experience of one parent, which was ridiculed by some Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that, if we received one letter about the poll tax, would we change our policy on that? The hon. Member for Maryhill said that we had referred to the view of only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 564</span>
one parent, and asked what would happen if we received two letters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way when I have made my point. The hon. Gentleman has been speaking for about an hour, and it seems longer. We have listened to him attentively, and I should be grateful if he would allow me to reply to the points made by Opposition Members. Much of his speech was devoted to complaining that I have not responded to arguments that he has given me no chance to answer.<br><br>
I intervened early in the debate to make it clear that the Government are minded to accept the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes. The individual case put by my hon. Friend was ridiculed by Opposition Members, and a somewhat silly speech was made by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who implied that my hon. Friend was exploiting the case. The letter was sent to draw the attention of the Committee to the worries of one parent [Hon. Gentlemen: "Set up."] Hon. Members are shouting, "set up", but I had no knowledge of the letter. I had a copy of the letter from the SPTC, which I read out. I heard the council's views at first hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about an apparent inaccuracy in that letter. It is suggested that there is no choice for parents. Has the Minister spoken to the HMI with responsibility for special education, Alistair Milne, and asked him about the workings of the 1981 Act? Zoning does not apply in areas where, because of their geographic nature, there is little choice for parents of children with special needs—such as the Highlands and Islands. Is the Minister denying that the choice exists now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. The hon. Member for Moray is on to a separate question. The SPTC is highlighting the fact that if an education authority takes a decision not to provide a special school but to go for greater integration than parents would wish, schools become unviable and are then no longer available. I do not for one moment endorse everything in the SPTC's letter, or in any other letter or representation that has been received by the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham said that were we to follow the course preferred by the hon. Lady and other Opposition Members, self-governing status would not be an option. Whether or not it is appropriate, practical and desirable and whether or not there are alternative facilities are matters to be decided in the case of any special school that wishes to take advantage of the legislation. I can assure the hon. Lady that we would not give consent to—nor, I believe, would the parents support—any proposal that was not soundly based and did not cater for the broad needs of children with special difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why then remove from the clause a prescription that is available as the Bill stands?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 565</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point, which the hon. Lady made in her speech. She asked why we should take away the Secretary of State's prescriptive powers, and I was not sure what she meant. As the Bill is drafted and before the amendment is accepted—should the Committee accept my advice— the Secretary of State would be able to make regulations to bring special schools within the scope of the Bill at a later date. He would have no prescriptive powers in directing or controlling what went on in the school. I thought that the Opposition's case against the Bill is that it is a centralising measure that puts too many powers into the hands of the Secretary of State. The SPTC and others have asked why a special school in Scotland wishing to become self-governing should have to persuade the Secretary of State to lay regulations, finding a slot here with all its procedural requirements, and perhaps losing the opportunity, the school being treated in a different way.<br><br>
As I said at the start of the debate, the arguments for delay are administrative and are not insuperable. If it is the will of the Committee and of organisations such as the SPTC, we should respond. I have read in the Scottish press that the Opposition have made much of my being a dogmatic, inflexible Minister who would not accept a single amendment. The colleagues of the hon. Member for Moray chose to disrupt business on the Floor of the House. They said that it was a waste of time participating in the Committee because the Government would not accept any amendments. I do not expect to hear that argument again, as I have accepted several amendments and have agreed to consider others.<br><br>
11.15 pm<br><br>
We have approached the Committee from the Bill's introduction, saying that we would examine and respond to the arguments. Frankly, if this afternoon is anything to go by, we have heard no Opposition arguments except that they wish to wreck the Bill. The Committee would not expect me to respond to that sort of unconstructive involvement. However, I exempt the hon. Member for Moray from those remarks, particularly in respect of special needs on which she has made a significant contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cited the SPTC and one parent in support of amendment No. 174. Will he confirm that not one organisation dealing with children with special needs has expressed support for amendment No. 174? Will he tell the Committee whether he has consulted any such organisations about that amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trespass on your patience, Mr. Martin, but as the hon. Gentleman was one of those who tabled the original amendment, he is probably better placed to answer that question than many other Members. I would not like to say that not a single organisation has come forward in support. But the SPTC has put forward arguments that seem convincing to me. The hon. Gentleman has not put forward one argument—nor have his colleagues— against the notion that special schools should be able to propose self-governing status. The Secretary of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 566</span>
State will doubtless wish to consult the organisations to which the hon. Member for Western Isles referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why did not the Minister say that before?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the hon. Gentleman seeks to deny the opportunity. I acknowledge that in particular circumstances, some schools could become self-governing after appropriate consultation and with a proposal that was worthy of support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is attempting to be reasonable, will he undertake to send a copy of today's <i>Hansard</i> to the SPTC? I am convinced that if its members read it they might begin to consider the matter more fully. Many members would change their minds, because they would have seen from that reference how utterly determined the Government are to avoid debate; they would have seen that serious points about the consequences for special education were coming entirely from this side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many people in the Committee may have thought that of sending a copy of today's <i>Hansard</i> to the SPTC. I know from a meeting that I had with the council on Friday that it has been following our proceedings studiously. But I shall not report to the Committee some of the informal comments that were passed to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that before making a change that will affect a group of people with special needs, it should be a basic principle of good administration and good manners to consult and inform those people? This is not the final opportunity for the Minister to make a change. If he waited until Report he would have time to consult. Will he confirm that he has not consulted any of the named groups since he made his decision on Friday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not make the decision on Friday. I listened to the arguments on Friday. We have been considering the matter for some time. The hon. Gentleman spoke about consultation with the groups, and so on. He will see that the Bill already provides for special schools to have self-governing status. That simply requires the laying of regulations by the Secretary of State. The principle has already been established.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle has not been established.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle of special schools being able to have self-governing status has already been established. To effect that, regulations must be laid by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may be arguing that there will be an opportunity to discuss the matter again and for people to make representations. The amendment would enable special schools to come forward for self-governing status, for specific cases to be considered by the Secretary of State and for representations to be made by outside bodies,

parents, local authorities and so on. The hon. Member for Western Isles still has not managed to focus his mind on the level at which the Bill will operate. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes described the matter succinctly when he said that we are concerned about the parents. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about the pressure groups and organisations which I should consult.<br><br>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was in the Committee during the speech of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, who complained about outside organisations influencing the Committee. Yet the hon. Member for Western Isles is telling me to consult outside organisations before making any decisions in the Committee. The outside organisation whose influence worried the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was the organisation representing parents in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), I should say that the suggestion was that the Conservative party in Scotland is behind this dirty deal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be responsible for his own comments. The Conservative party was not involved in any way, and I know that his comments will cause great offence to the parents' organisation. I give notice to the hon. Gentleman that I intend to use his comments and those of his hon. Friend on every occasion when the Labour party claims to be concerned with parental interests. The hon. Gentleman must rise above being the mouthpiece of the Educational Institute of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not now clear from the interventions of the hon. Members for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and for Fife, Central that the amendment separates the two sides of the Committee? The Opposition are interested in the vesting interests of organisations and the Government are interested in the little people—the parents. The amendment would provide the opportunity for parents with handicapped children to have the same rights. Those who have nobody to speak for them—the Mrs. Lamonts of this world— are the little people to whom we are giving priority, and that is what the Opposition object to so strongly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, although I am not sure that I would agree with the diminutive adjective which he used. I think that some of the "little people" can be observed among the Bill's opponents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to what he said on consultation when we were dealing with clause 7 and the issue of special needs. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should be happy to take on board suggestions made by those organisations."—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 4 April 1989; c.368–9.]</p></blockquote>
He was referring to an organisation involved in special education and special needs, and said that he would ensure that Scottish Office talked to the leading organisations before bringing back amendments on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 568</span>
Report. Why can we not have the same arrangement for clause 13?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the amendment is passed, I give an undertaking to ask my officials in these discussions to consider what would be required for a draft scheme of government, were a special school to opt out, and what detailed safeguards would be needed in areas already referred to by the hon. Lady. That may go some way towards meeting her argument. But it cannot be right to exclude all special schools from the opportunity of opting out. It is right that the provisions for acquiring self-governing status are carefully considered, and I am happy to give the hon. Lady that undertaking. We shall, of course, consult interested organisations.<br><br>
The debate tonight would have convinced me—if I were not already fairly convinced—that an application for self-governing status from a special school would require very careful consideration. We would want to be sympathetic, but to ensure that those promoting such proposals understood what they were taking on and could prove their commitment to the concept of running a special school.<br><br>
I find it hard to imagine that anyone not committed to the idea would propose it. Nevertheless, this is a matter on which we want to assure ourselves. The mechanism for that kind of scrutiny would come under the procedure for submission of proposals in clause 16. Those proposals would have to state what provision the school makes for special educational needs. For a special school, that would obviously cover everything. We would expect specific proposals about the number of pupils, the range of needs covered, staffing arrangements, accommodation, special equipment and the permanent links that the school has with other schools, the education authority or voluntary bodies.<br><br>
We shall be preparing model proposals for the use of schools making proposals for self-governing status. As I informed the hon. Member for Moray, we will almost certainly need a separate model for special schools. As for the duties of the local authority, I said earlier that it retains the duty of recording special educational needs for all children in its area, irrespective of what type of school they attend. I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East is listening, because that is the third time that I have had to say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has readily admitted that so much consultation is needed, would it not make more sense to withdraw the amendment? That would show the Committee much more grace and willingness to co-operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much consultation is needed in respect of mainstream schools, too, but that is no argument for withdrawing the amendment. The hon. Lady will have to do better than that to persuade me to retreat from creating choice for parents of children with special needs. The education authority will continue to be responsible for the psychological services, which are open to all pupils and not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 569</span>
exclusively those in local authority schools. The Bill provides that local authorities will have continuing responsibilities for transport and a general duty to treat pupils attending self-governing schools no less favourably in matters in which the authority has a power or a duty to provide a service for pupils.<br><br>
There is a new clause that we shall discuss later.</span></p>
<p>11.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Minister has already said that education authorities will be responsible for recording the special needs of all children in their areas, regardless of the schools that they attend. I asked how the education authority would be able to monitor that and how would it ensure that such special needs would be met in a self-governing school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The inspectorate will continue to have responsibilities for self-governing schools. Local authorities have specialist advisers who will be able to provide support to those schools. The board of management will have a duty to ensure that that happens and, of course, the parents will be involved. I believe that those are all proper safeguards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that that will be sufficient protection to ensure that the special needs of children will be met in self-governing schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell me what additional protection is available for schools in the local authority system that will not apply for self-governing schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is deliberate, but the Minister is failing to understand the point that I am making. The education authority is responsible for recording the special needs of children, and must ensure that those needs are met in the schools under its control. How will that authority be able to ensure that such needs are met in schools that are not under its control? The authority's advisers may be able to offer advice, but how can the authority ensure that such self-governing schools will fulfil the requirements of the special needs that the education authority must record for individual pupils in those schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is straightforward and there is nothing new about it. There are special schools that are run by voluntary organisations outside the local authority system that do a first-class job. The children's records of needs remain the responsibility of the local authority and such responsibility is executed. I see no particular problem with self-governing schools as the position will be the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The voluntary schools are not self-governing and are not affected by the provisions in the Bill. Self-governing schools will be able to change their characteristics by means of a ballot, and I understand that no voluntary school can do that.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 570</span>
What protection will there be against self-governing schools misusing their ability to change their characteristics, so excluding some children from those schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has slid off the point that he was making. He was referring to the record of needs, but he is now asking about admissions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not the same thing—one is about admissions and the other is about the record of needs. The hon. Gentleman was asking what would happen with regard to the record of needs. I said that the record of needs would continue to be the local authority's responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister does not know the answer, he should say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member made a lengthy contribution to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A large part of the hon. Gentleman's speech covered that point. The hon. Gentleman sought to argue that there would be a problem about maintaining a record of needs and the local authority's responsibilities. There is no problem with the independent voluntary schools that operate at present, and there will be no problem with self-governing schools. I am sorry if I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, but I did not think that he was making such an obvious point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray asked about admissions. As she is aware, the admissions arrangements of a school will figure in its proposals and be written into the scheme of government. If the school provides for a certain number of severely mentally handicapped and profoundly mentally handicapped pupils, it will be bound to continue to do so.<br><br>
That could later be changed under the provisions of clause 28, but I hardly think that parents of such children, having committed themselves to the management of that special school, will be readily motivated to change the characteristics of the school without good reason. There is, of course, the protection that any change would require the approval of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need not always deal with negative changes in admissions policies in those schools. Can we explore the scope for positive responses to new needs that arise in a community? For example, a deaf girl with cerebral palsy may require a Possum machine, which is an extremely expensive piece of equipment. What guarantee is there that the board of management would have the facility to take that child into the school?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 571</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has asked me to consider and consult about special needs provision in self-governing schools, and I have given an undertaking to do so. If the special schools come within the scope of the self-governing schools provisions, we should clearly have to extend the undertaking that I have given, to encompass special schools. I entirely understand the hon. Lady's point, and we shall try to respond.<br><br>
The duties of local authorities under the parents' charter are modified in the case of special schools under schedule A2 to the 1980 Act, to the effect that a placing request in respect of a recorded child may apply to a school other than a public school, and if the managers of that school are willing to admit the child, it is the duty of the authority to meet the fees and other necessary costs of the child's attendance at that school. That would apply to self-governing schools except, of course, that self-governing schools will not charge fees. If there were extra costs associated with the child's attendance at the school, the local authority would be obliged to meet them, as subject to its general duties in placing children with special needs. We shall deal with those duties under clause 65.<br><br>
I apologise to the Committee for having spoken at some length, but hon. Members were keen that I should deal with all the matters that were raised. I hope that they will understand why I believe that the Committee should accept amendments Nos. 174 and 97 and reject amendments Nos. 37 and 67.</span></p>

In clause 13(4) the Government have set down an interesting idea of the appropriate percentage of parents required to start the ballot process. If the principle that 10 per cent, is enough holds good for this exercise of the expression of opinion, it must hold good for other topics. If 10 per cent, of the Scottish people said that they wanted a ballot on having a Scottish Assembly, would they get one?<br><br>
