	<div class='title'>DUTY OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO MAINTAIN SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 2, in page 1, line 8, leave out
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the provisions of this part"</p></q></p>
	<p>and insert

	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 3, in page 1, line 9, after "state", insert
	<br><q><p>"following consultation with the local education authority in the area in which the school is situated,".</p></q></p>

	<p>No. 5, in page 1, line 8, from "Part" to "any" in line 9 and insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned, we were making the point that the Government are building bridges with parents to further their political reforms of the education system. The amendments would inject balance into the clause. People are worried about the erosion of local democracy, local accountability and local involvement. I do not want to go into detail on those issues because it would be more appropriate to discuss them in the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members and educational interests in Scotland are worried because the Government are giving themselves powers to maintain self-governing schools. We shall identify the large number of powers that the Secretary of State is taking upon himself in the Bill. It would be useful for Parliament to have some control over the Executive. The reasons are obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish education has been a partnership between local education authorities, the Secretary of State and many educational interests. This major clause places a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
duty on the Secretary of State to maintain self-governing schools. In the past few years the power of Parliament has been eroded on a host of matters. The Government's educational reforms arouse suspicion in Scotland. It would be a small concession to allow Parliament to exercise democratic accountability on behalf of the electorate and have some say in this matter. In the past 10 years the Government have ridden roughshod over many of Parliament's attempts to control the Executive. The Scottish Office has been involved in problems of constitutional arrangements and parliamentary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government will respond positively to the amendment. They should explain why this measure is necessary when there is no demand for parents, local authorities, teaching unions, the Scottish Consumer Council or the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, who have been supportive in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to reinforce a sense of local identity. It is appalling hypocrisy for the Government to suggest that by these 47 clauses on opting-out in part I of the Bill they are providing parental choice instead of political control. How can the Secretary of State assume powers and then devolve them back, both financially and administratively, to parents and pupils in an opted-out school? That is the crucial element that we are trying to thread through the fabric of the Committee stage, but points made here may be repeated on the stand part debate. We look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7, which have been associated with amendment No. 2, stand in the name of myself and my honourable Friends the Members for Glasgow, Go-van (Mr. Sillars), for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) and for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), who are not members of the Committee. I was surprised to see the name of my honourable Friend the Member for Go-van still on the amendment paper because it is normal practice, when an honourable Member is suspended from the House, to remove his or her name from all Order and amendment papers. It just shows that my honourable Friend will be back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horn-castle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the honourable Lady has said shows the pointlessness of the behaviour in which the honourable Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) indulged. Because of that, his voice cannot now be heard on behalf of his constituents. What has he achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the honourable Lady will not respond to that intervention. Once again, I stress that we are discussing the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resist the temptation because of my respect for you, Mr. Martin. However, I remind the honourable Member for Gainsborough Hor-ncastle (Mr. Leigh) that my honourable Friends have been excluded from debating an important piece of Scottish legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are relevant to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
amendment No. 2 and reinforce many of the points made by the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). Like him, I shall hold back some of my remarks until the stand part debate because that will allow me greater flexibility to discuss the principles at stake, particularly that of accountability. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 deal with finance. Our wish to delete subsection (2) is designed to show that the funding of schools that have decided to opt out may be to the disadvantage of schools remaining within the current educational system. It is important to ask whether other taxpayers should be asked to support the schools that opt out to the detriment of others. I hope that the group of amendments will be taken as one, and I shall return to other important points on the stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning we discussed the survey that the Minister has set in motion. I mentioned the way in which the Government have decided to approach the issue. They have decided to do something and examine the results later. The usual approach is to do the studies, arrive at conclusions and as a result of them take action. The Government have got it the other way round. The survey will become available after the Committee's deliberations, but we should like to consider it later. That is why it is important to accept amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in clause 1 should be amended in the way suggested by the amendment. What are the Minister's plans for reviewing the measures in the clause? Will he set in motion an assessment or a way of dealing with them? I hope that he will not come up with the standard, preset questionnaire or review that delivers the answers that are sought. Perhaps the Minister could use any statutory methods that may exist, but if not, I trust that he will introduce some new methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is confident of his actions, there should be no trouble in bringing back this issue for annual scrutiny by Parliament. He is part of an open Government. Whenever anyone says anything against him, he rushes to the press to make a response, even to the humblest person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even the honourable Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have only to appear at 6.45 am on "Good Morning Scotland" for him to phone in a statement at 7 am saying, "Blah Blah, it's all a lot of rubbish". That is his level of debate: he dismisses what others say in a few words. That is why those measures should be brought back for the House to review and why I support amendment No. 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston (Inverness, Nairn and Locha-ber)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the Government can reasonably reject this moderate amendment. One of the many puzzles in the Bill is that there appears to be no means for a school that has come out of the system to go back into it. That is impractical in the long term as no Government can say that whatever they do will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
last for ever. There is much doubt about whether the method that allows opting out to take place has a long-term validity. So the Government should not easily resist the possibility of a change backwards or of reviewing a particular case. What is wrong with examining how what many of us regard as hastily hammered together legislation is working out? The affirmative procedure is not too exciting as the Government allow only an hour and a half debate and the vote down the objection. The reality is not dramatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is directed towards the honourable Member for Moray and Nairn—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nairn? The honourable Gentleman represents Nairn. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you would rule all the hilarity out of order, Mr. Martin. Amendment No. 5 would replace
	<br><q><p>"the duty of the Secretary of State to maintain"</p></q>
with the words
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State may maintain".</p></q>
The Government do not propose to create private schools that will be self-supporting financially. They propose a different method of running schools, with the state retaining responsibility for financing. I do not understand the amendment tabled by the honourable Member for Moray.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between the two sides of the Committee lies in the way in which we attempt to achieve local and democratic control over schools. The Minister attempts to achieve it by the proposals in clause 1, which aims to undermine the present system. At the moment, local education authorities, which arc directly elected by voters, are responsible for running schools. The Minister wishes to replace them with a system whereby the Secretary of State for Scotland, in collaboration with a small clutch of parents, could agree to opt out schools from such democratic control and have them run from Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that real democratic control consists of people standing for election, explaining their policies on education, setting up schools in accordance with those policies and submitting the policies to the views of the electorate. The Minister argues that boards of management should be set up and elected by a smaller percentage of the electorate of parents. The Minister has not said what percentage of parents would have to vote for opting out before the Secretary of State would allow it. The Minister has been careful not to commit himself, unlike the Education Reform Act 1988 which states that in the first ballot, at least 50 per cent of the parents should vote. If not, there should be a second ballot within 14 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the boards of management, which could be totally unrepresentative of the parents, should be given direct control over the school, but in name only. The amendment tabled by the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
tackles the fact that the Government will fund and therefore control schools that opt out. He who pays the piper calls the tune. The Minister may shake his head, but the boards of management will be unable to make critical decisions about the type of education that the schools provide because they will not control the budget. The Secretary of State will determine how much money they have to spend on school buildings and books. They can add a few luxuries by fund raising or accepting donations of property and so on, but the core funding will come from the Secretary of State for Scotland. That is extremely objectionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to add a political dimension to the issue. In Dundee, Tayside regional council is the education authority. There are 20 Dundee councillors on Tayside regional council, of whom 17 are Labour and three Conservative. Therefore, Dundee schools should reflect the fact that the Dundee people elected 17 Labour councillors and should remain comprehensives within the education authority system. The Minister cannot get round that. In a fair election, 17 Conservative councillors could not be elected in Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the honourable Gentleman does not detain the Committee, I refer him to the Bill. The clauses that deal with funding state that the funding given to a self-governing school will not be determined by the Secretary of State. It will reflect the policies determined by the education authority because the school will be funded on the same basis. What the honourable Gentleman said was misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is again misleading the Committee. The Secretary of State will decide whether the funding reflects the priorities of the local education authority. Nothing in the Bill says that the education authority or the board of management can insist on the level of funding given to a particular opted-out school. The key decision will remain with the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we know that the decision really lies with the Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Stirling. He calls the shots for schools in Scotland; the Secretary of State just does his bidding. That is the critical argument. The Under-Secretary wants to get control of the key schools in his area, which happen to be in Conservative-controlled areas. That is in defiance of the democractically expressed views of those who live there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fundamental point that opted out schools do not opt out in a vacuum. When they opt out of the local authority system, that has a knock-on effect on every school in the system. Parents should not decide whether a school should opt out because they could seriously undermine the rights of parents and pupils in schools in adjacent areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend agree that the Under-Secretary's statement implies that local authorities say that funding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
will be commensurate with what the local education authority has been providing. But for years the Scottish Office has been telling us that lcoal authorities have overspent. Will the level be that of the local authorities that have overspent, or will it be that of the Scottish Office, which is less? Will the local education authority be involved at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a telling point and the Minister nods in assent. In fact, he is saying that what he regards as a high-spending authority, such as Lothian, which the Minister said had overspent in its schools for years, will be penalised. When a school opts out in Lothian, will it be funded to the same level as the education authority funded it? That will be well above what the Minister thinks desirable. A high-spending local authority will get more money from the Government than a low-spending authority. That is a novel idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister nods his head. Will he intervene to confirm that that is so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman had done his homework before coming to the Committee and had read the consultation document, the subsequent statements, and the speeches made on Second Reading, he would know that we have made it absolutely clear that schools will be funded on exactly the same basis as they could expect to have been funded had they remained local authority schools. So if a school in a local authority that has a higher staffing ratio and provides additional funding over and above that of another authority becomes self-governing, it will be funded on that basis. That is the fundamental principle. That is why it is absurd for Opposition Members to argue that this is a centralising measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in the least absurd. That may be the Minister's intention, but the key decision is left with the Secretary of State for Scotland. Nothing in the Bill restricts the Secretary of State in deciding the level of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will argue that that is what the Secretary of State for Scotland will do, but nothing in the Bill requires him to take such a decision. He could argue that it was difficult to judge how much money might have been received had the school been under local education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is flexible enough for the Secretary of State for Scotland to increase or decrease spending on an opted-out school. The Minister must be honest and accept that. He should do his homework so that he can understand the Bill</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will notice that the Under-Secretary of State has not explained why it is appropriate that a self-governing school should be funded at the same level as that which drew the Secretary of State's disapproval when run by a local authority. That may be explained in the documents mentioned, but it is not in the record of our proceedings. It would be valuable to put those reasons on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. Perhaps the Minister will say why be believes that the level of funding that was unsatisfactory under an education authority can be justified for a school with opted-out status. That seems a silly idea, but the Under-Secretary has many silly ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is about the democratic control of schools. It is not about giving power to parents but it is about taking it away from local education authorities. That is what we find so objectionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poll tax will be imposed on Scotland in two weeks' time. The Minister says that it will make local authorities more accountable to their electorates. If that is so, why is the Minister taking schools out of education authorities' control and putting them into the hands of a small board of management which is not accountable to parents or the local community? That is a step away from democracy, but we should not expect democracy from the Minister and his lackeys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the points made by the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about funding. Under clause 25(2) the Secretary of State has regulations making powers for funding. The Bill provides for him to recoup the cost from the local authority. Paragraph 8 of the document "Self-Governing Schools", subheaded "Extending Choice for Scottish Parents" which was announced by written answer to my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) in December, says:
	<br><q><p>"Self-governing schools, although under independent local management, will be funded by the Secretary of State; they will not be able to charge fees. The level of grant for running costs will be determined so that an individual self-governing school will be no worse-off, but neither any better-off, than it could reasonably have expected if it had remained under local authority management. The full amount of grant for running costs paid by the Secretary of State to each self-governing school will be recovered from the appropriate education authority."</p></q>
That document, which was widely circulated, made it clear that the level of funding would be commensurate with the decisions taken by the eductaion authority, not the Secretry of State. I am astonished that that comes as news to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the Opposition's argument, the Under-Secretary quoted clause 25. Will he give examples of "special purpose grants" as defined in clause 25(3) because they seem different from current funding regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could respond to the honourable Lady, but if I did so, you would call me to order, Mr. Martin. There will be an opportuity to deal with the matter when we reach clause 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might, for example, be a need for "special purpose grants" as a result of rationalisation, or to cover redundancy costs, or if provision has to be made for special in-service training requirements. The grants are envisaged only as ad hoc grants. They would not be the principal basis of funding, and would be consistent with the principle that a school should be:

	<br><q><p>"no worse-off, but neither any better-off, than…if it had remained under local authority management."</p></q>
That means that self-governing schools in local authorities, such as Strathclyde, where the staffing levels and the expenditure per pupil is not as high as in Lothian, would do less well than self-governing schools in Lothian because of the local authority's education policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the Minister's difficulty in answering because we have strayed into another part of the Bill, but the subject relates to our amendments. I find it strange that the Minister could not give more positive examples than rationalisation and redundancy cost. That would almost imply that the Government anticipate that the legislation will result in rationalisation and redundancy costs. The Minister also mentioned in-service training, which is surely a part of the overall pattern of education provision within Scotland. The definition of special purpose grants, which relate back to the funding that is dealt with under subsection (2), is not satisfactory, and we need more information from the Minister before we decide how we shall vote on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady is focusing on grants that will be there for a special purpose. She said that it was negative to highlight redundancies. If there were no redundancies—I expect that we are agreed in our wish that there should be none—there would be no special purpose grant. That is where the honourable Lady underlines my argument. She is concentrating the debate on the margin, whereas the amendments relate to the main source of funding for self-governing schools—the grant that comes from my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State, but reflects the policies of the local authority. She and other Opposition Members have been keen to tell people in Scotland that the Bill is a centralising measure and we intend to take over the running of the schools from local authorities and they all nod in enthusiasm.

For those who are concerned about anglicising, amendment No. 2 is identical to an amendment that was tabled by the honourable Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) to the Education Reform Bill, down to the last comma and word. That shows most extraordinary prescience. The Opposition have taken the line that they are worried about schools being subject to centralisation. Is it not ironic that their very first amendment is designed to undermine the stability of self-governing schools by imposing a requirement that the powers of the Bill be renewed annually, and providing scope for a future Secretary of State to tinker with the details on each occasion? That seems to be a centralising measure, yet it is being proposed by the honourable Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister eloquently managed to wriggle out of mentioning costs and grants. I do not want to spend too much time on them, so perhaps the Minister will assure us that he will brief himself more

fully on two aspects: capital grants and special purpose grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the measures that affect England and Wales, my honourable Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) suggested that bribes, in the form of special purpose grants, would be given to schools that opt out. The Minister has not dispelled any of our fears on that. Equally important are capital grants, because it is clear that separate capital grant structure will be developed for opted out schools, which could financially disadvantage the local education authority schools that remain. We need some assurances from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the honourable Gentleman does not expect me to deal now with questions that will be more appropriately dealt with under clause 25. If he wishes to assist the Committee to reach that point in the Bill, I shall be only too happy to respond at that stage. There may even be an opportunity later this evening to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the honourable Gentleman looks at column 810 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Tuesday 26 January 1988, he will find the amendment moved by the honourable Member for Blackburn. It may come as a surprise to him, but he will see that the amendment contains the same terms. He will also be able to read the report of the discussion that took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman did not respond to my basic point, which is that under the Bill, once the schools have been granted self-governing status by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State, their finance will be guaranteed and will reflect the policies of the local authority. It will not be determined by the Secretary of State, and the schools will enjoy security and independence as a result. The amendments would make both the funding of the schools and their existence subject to annual approval by Parliament in Westminster. That is an extraordinary proposition from people who have championed the cause against centralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the honourable Member for Moray supports the amendment tabled by the honourable Member for Fife, Central, but her party's amendment puts into doubt whether the opted-out schools will be funded at all. It takes away the guarantee of funding and makes the position one in which the Secretary of State "may" decide to maintain them. If the honourable Lady thinks that schools will not feel under the heel of political control should the Secretary of State decide whether or not they receive money, then her view of political reality is different from mine. The Bill will give schools independence within the state sector. I should have thought that that slogan would appeal to the honourable Member for Moray and other Opposition Members, if only because it has a ring to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions for central control are remarkably weak. The Government will have no hand in the appointment of members of the board of management nor in the selection of staff. The board will inherit the local education authority's responsibility
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
for the curriculum. The financing of each school will be based on what it would have expected to obtain from the education authority, and schools will have the security of knowing that their funding cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn by a future Secretary of State unless he gives seven years' notice. That is more than the length of a Parliament. We aim to give the schools maximum independence and freedom from interference. It is significant that the Committee's deliberations should begin with the Opposition attempting to undermine those principles, but the Government believe in freedom of choice and diversity and that is at the heart of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that we shall debate funding later, but the Minister said that it will be determined by the local education authority. Where do those words appear in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman looks in clause 25 (2), he will see that the Secretary of State has powers to make regulations and it is clear that the principles of funding will be as I have outlined them and as they are set out in the consultation document, which was published in December and to which we have received some responses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that when the Secretary of State makes regulations on the funding of schools, they will contain reference to local education authorities and their level of finance, and that the regulations will not contain such waffly statements such as "reasonable expectations"? Will the regulations specify that the funding will be directly related to the funding of the local education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government never put waffly words in the regulations that they lay before the House. We try to make them as specific as possible. I am sure that the honourable Gentleman will have the opportunity, when the regulations are debated in the House, to remind me or, as is more likely, my successor of the commitments made by my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State in the consultation document and on subsequent occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the opted-out schools will be given finance commensurate with what they would expect from the local education authority and that it will be assessed year by year? Will the Secretary of State examine a local education authority's expenditure annually, and if it spends less the year after a school has opted out, will the school then receive less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, while the Government have been in power education authorities have been able to look forward to real increases in the level of funding. The previous Labour Government experienced a period of turbulence when it was necessary to make cuts, but that has not been a feature of this Government. As long as education authorities are able to increase funding to reflect the developments that are part of our reform programme, self-governing schools will benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not being asked whether overall funding will be cut or increased. We accept that the Minister cannot foresee the future. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has demonstrated that. Regardless of whether the total amount made available by central Government goes up or down, will it be shared equally between opted-out schools and local authority schools? Will the Minister stop wriggling and answer the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not wriggling. The difference between the Government and the Opposition is that my right honourable Friend the Chancellor is happy to be reminded of his record whereas the Opposition are not. We have been able to increase funding for education in real terms because of the success of our economic policy and I expect that to continue. I repeat that opted-out schools will be funded on the same basis as under the local authority system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to the honourable Gentleman may I respond to some of the points that have been made? The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) said that there did not seem to be a way back for schools that had become self-governing. I do not want to stray too far into that issue, but clauses 29, 44 and 45(3) show that there is a way back if the local authority agrees to the board of management's proposals for discontinuance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray said that funding should not be provided to the detriment of other taxpayers. There may have been a misunderstanding of the type suggested by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber. Opted-out schools will not be private schools. They will not be independent schools outside the state system, so it is right that they should be funded by the taxpayer. It is wrong to talk about the detriment of the taxpayer. The only difference between self-governing schools and other local authority schools is that the former will be run by a board of management, not an education authority. They will benefit because they will receive some of the costs that would have been spent on administration on their behalf. Perhaps that was what led the honourable Member for Moray to table the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will special purpose grants be available to local authority schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the honourable Lady asked that question. I should like to consider the extension of special purpose grants because occasionally I get clobbered. One view of basic adult education held by Opposition Members and others is that that Scotland is worse done by than England because much more money is provided for that purpose in England which has a system of specific grants. In Scotland, we give the local authorities the money so that they can determine their priorities. When some of them have taken the money, they complain that we are not providing the money for that purpose. Whenever I suggest that we might look at specific grants, COSLA reels in horror and says that it would not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
prepared to accept them. I promise that I will take up the honourable Lady's suggestion and examine that further. It is a positive suggestion and I take it that that is her party's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments can best be described as wrecking measures, or alternatively a revealing glimpse of the Labour Party's thinking on education. If the Labour party does not want schools that are not accountable and subject to votes by politicians on an annual basis it is because it wants to have power over those schools. The Bill is about setting schools free and allowing them to meet the needs of parents and children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the debate with great interest. The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has done the Committee a great service. He has shown that many Opposition Members have not taken the trouble to read the details of the Bill as some of us have done. They have not read the clauses. It was very revealing when the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that the independent schools with the new self-governing status could not be treated on the same financial basis as local authority schools. To see his error, all that we have to do is read clause 25(2), just as my honourable Friend the Minister said. We have a clear demonstration that the Opposition do not understand the Bill. They have not read it and do not want to understand it. I am grateful to my honourable Friend for convincing me that it is absolutely essential that we defeat these wrecking amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel I must respond to that last idiotic intervention from the Englishman, the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). He may have read the Bill but he certainly has not understood it. Let me direct him to the reality of what the Minister said, of what the Bill says and what the other Scottish Office Document says. The key phrase is "It will be determined". The Secretary of State for Scotland will be the person who will determine the level of funding in any opted-out school. The Minister may repeat that that will be on the same basis as might have been expected had they remained in the control of the local education authority, but to convince the Opposition, he must spell out exactly what they will mean in terms of the regulations that are laid for a particular school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take capital funding, for example. What is meant by saying that a school will continue to receive the same level of capital funding as it would have done under a local education authority? Does it mean that the pattern of capital expenditure in that school over the past 10 years will be repeated for the next 10 years? Does it mean that the level of capital expenditure in that school will be the same as the level of capital expenditure in every other school in that area? Of course it does not. All the schools will be of different ages and will require different levels of capital expenditure. What we have heard from the Minister is meaningless.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
The same is true about current expenditure. What kind of current expenditure can an opted-out school expect to get? Will it be exactly the same as schools that remain under the control of local authorities? Of course it will not. It will depend on the role and the spending that has been the historical pattern of the school or on some future provision which equates it to spending on other schools within that same area. The Minister has said nothing on these matters, and until he does the Opposition will not be convinced by his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can clarify this for the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). He clearly does not understand this but I am not convinced that he has read the Bill either. Clause 25(2)says:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
(Mr. Galbraith speaking)
	<br><q><p>"the education authority which maintained the school before the incorporation date shall provide the Secretary of State with such information"</p></q>
as he may require them. Nothing in the clause, which the Minister keeps mentioning, says that the funding shall be the same within reasonable expectations. Will the Minister give us a guarantee when the regulations come before the House? There is no such guarantee in the Bill. Perhaps the honourable Gentleman has not read the Bill properly, or does not understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 9, after "state", insert
	<br><q><p>"following consultation with the local education authority in the area in which the school is situated,".</p></q>
If the amendment were accepted, clause 1(1) would read:
	<br><q><p>"it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State following consultation with the local education authority in the area in which the school is situated to maintain any school governed by a board of management incorporated under section 18(2) of this Act."</p></q>
Clause 18 deals with the rejection or approval by the Secretary of State for Scotland of any proposals for opting out. It provides that one month after the Secretary of State has received such proposals, he will have to consider any representations made upon them. As clause 17(3) states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
	<br><q><p>"any person may submit representations to the Secretary of State as regards the proposals."</p></q>
"Any person" could mean local education authorities, school boards, trade unions, parent groups, or churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals not with the being allowed to make representations on the proposals, but with the right of the local education authority to be consulted after the Secretary of State has decided whether to approve the opting-out proposals. That distinction must be drawn at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 18, if the Secretary of State finds against the school board or the parents who have applied to opt out, he must first consult with the school board before he rejects or modifies that proposal. Clause 18(l)(a) and (b) make that very clear. However, where the Secretary of State finds against the education authority, in that he approves the proposal to opt out, he is under no obligation to consult with the education authority before going on to the next stage. It seems unfair and unequal that school boards will be consulted before their proposals are rejected, but education authorities will not be consulted before their views are rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opting-out proposals will be based on the election results of parents involved in the ballot, and those in favour of opting out will have made a case against the education authorities in trying to justify to parents why a school should be allowed to opt out of local authority control. The case made during the election campaign could be tantamount to scaremongering through wild stories and exaggeration. That is sometimes very effective, as can be seen by the election of the Under-Secretary. The education authorities should be consulted and make clear to the Secretary of State for Scotland that the case presented to him initially might not be accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole procedure for initiating the opting-out proposals begins with a resolution carried on the basis of a simple majority of the school board, and that could be as narrow as 4:3. Ten per cent of parents might have made a written request and so, in a school of 1,000, that would mean that only 100 parents had requested a ballot. We do not know what percentage must vote in that ballot. The Bill specifies only that it must be
	<br><q><p>"a simple majority of votes cast".</p></q>
If a school of 1,000 has a 70 per cent turn out in a ballot, of the 700 voting, 351 might vote for opting out and 349 against it. We do not know whether the Secretary of State will decide that the figure is sufficient to justify opting out. He could proceed with opting out on the basis of a small minority of votes cast in a ballot and a (small) minority of parents in the electrorate. It is important that education authorities are consultetd so that they can give the Secretary of State the benefit of their knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Secretary of State decides about opting out, clause 16 sets out the next stage. The school board must produce a statement about how the school will be run after it has opted out. That is a strange procedure. The statement should surely come before
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
and not after the election. However, even then that could be misrepresented by the small group of parents who are pushing through the proposals. It is important that the Minister or Secretary of State for Scotland consult local education authorities, which have far greater and more extensive knowledge of their areas than anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must consider merely whether a majority of parents are behind the proposals, but what impact the school opting out might have on surrounding schools in adjacent areas and on the children's education. The education authorities are the only bodies that can inform him of that, as they have hands-on, local, detailed knowledge. If this legislation includes the provision that school boards must be consulted, the Minister must make a good case for not giving education authorities the same privilege and treatment. There is nothing controversial in the amendment, and nothing that the Minister should not be prepared to concede. The amendment is logical, responsible and fair and the Minister should accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is not technically correct, but I see no great objection in principle to his argument. My briefing says to resist the amendment, but if the honourable Gentleman were to agree to withdraw it, we could return to the matter on clause 18 which, as he suggested, might be a more appropriate place. I shall consider the implications of the proposal, but off the top of my head I see no great objection to it. However, I do not suppose the honourable Gentleman would expect me to legislate or put matters to the Committee off the top of my head. I hope that I can persuade him to withdraw the amendment on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) does not hold the Minister back, I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister's promise. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 16, leave out "self-governing" and insert "grant-maintained". In view of the Minister's rare concession, I shall be more moderate in my tone on this small but reasonably important amendment. The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes and the Under-Secretary spoke about the notion of the "independent" school. I am more puzzled and apprehensive about the use of that word than either "self-governing" or "grant-maintained". Therefore, I shall stick to the amendment before us rather than deal with the confusion that surrounds what we shall call the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The premise of the amendment is for the Government to be politically honest about their intentions. It is clear from history in England and Wales that people
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
have had the courage to call an opted-out school what it is—a grant-maintained school maintained by central Government, using the resources taken from the local authority and given to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment merely seeks to put such schools on the same level, so that independent or self-governing schools have a more suitable description. The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes may be giving away some of his English pedigree by nodding furiously in response to that. We did not intend to put the matter to a vote, but shall do so if there is division on the matter among Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of political honesty. The Bill is full of phraseology. We talked earlier about the education service and self-governing schools. The problem is that if we talk about grant-maintained schools, we know where we are. There is deceit in talking about ' self-governing schools, as the phrase conveys an element of devolution to the school which may not exist. I as the Minister to consider the change in terminology which would better reflectthe political aspirations of himself and his honourable Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was using the term "independent" with a small "i" rather than a capital "I". In the sense that conservatives with a small "c" are on that side of the Committee, there is a distinction. The capital letter is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly surprised to see the amendment. I was also slightly surprised when the honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) said on Second Reading that "self-govern" was a dishonest term and agued that "grant-maintained" would be more appropriate. If the honourable Member for Fife, Central were to convey to his honourable Friend the information gleaned on the first group of amendments, he may feel that it was less dishonest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those schools will be self-governing and will be run by their own boards of management. They will take their own decisions. When we were thinking about the title of the Bill, we had no idea that "self-Governing schools" would become so effective in communicating the substance of the Bill or would provoke such opposition. We are pleased about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that during the Govan by-election the honourable Gentleman and his colleagues were intent on suggesting that our education reforms would anglicise Scottish education. I now know that the honourable Gentleman thinks differently. He now argues that any good ideas from the south will be carefully considered. Although he does not regard self-governing schools as a good idea, some amendments favour following his English colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Grant-maintained" as a phrase is meaningless in the Scottish tradition. Has I proposed that term, the Opposition would have been horrified and might have tabled an amendment to change the term to "self-governing". It would be alien and meaningless within our education tradition to use such a term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) chuckles, but a previous mentioned local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
education authorities. We do not have local education authorities in Scotland. "Local education authorities" is an English term; in Scotland we have education authorities. Furthermore, the honourable Member for Fife, Central has tackled party questions on the Audit Commission, a body whose remit does not extend to Scotland. Those who seek to make distinctions—we must remember the sensitivities of the honourable Member for Moray—should get their terminology right. I shall resist any attempt to get me to import an English educational term into a Bill that enhances choice and opportunities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Self-governing" is not inappropriate; It is particularly descriptive. I know that the honourable Member for Fife, Central and his colleagues wish to present this as an extension of the control of my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State, but a reasonable person can see that any Bill that seeks to enhance central control is weak. This Bill confers no power on the Secretary of State in three central areas. First, the Secretary of State has no power over the selection of staff. Secondly, he has no influence or control over appointments to the board of management. Thirdly, nothing in the Bill requires the Government to enforce any closer control over the curriculum than is already there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that the Scottish Education Dept will take over from education authorities is totally without foundation. If it were so, we should have to plan for a major extension of the staffing of the Scottish Education Dept. No such plans are afoot. The SED will not be the education authority of a self-governing school. The school's own board of management will be its education authority. Anyone who thinks that the Bill will extend Government control must think that parents are extraordinarily gullible.

But there is one respect in which I sympathise with the amendment. In England and Wales a maintained school means what we would call a public school—a school maintained at public expense. It is appropriate to use "grant-maintained" in that context, because such schools will remain in the public sector, as will self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) referred to the fact that I had telephoned "Good Morning Scotland" at 6.45 am after one of his press releases had been read in which it was suggested that self-governing hospitals would opt out of the National Health Service. That is another misapprehension that is being deliberately put abroad. Self-governing hospitals will remain part of state education provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although "grant-maintained" is a good phrase to use for schools in England and Wales, it is alien to Scottish usage. We prefer a term that emphasises the basic characteristic of such schools—their autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Fife, Central does know whether to criticise us for nationalising schools—the term he used on the spur of the moment—or for privatising them. Opposition Members would like the world to believe that we are doing both at once; we are doing neither. What Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
Members really object to is denting local authority paternalism and giving people some self-determination. That we shall do, regardless of nomenclature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my honourable Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had another example of tautology from the Under-Secretary. It is political dishonesty. These measures, especially the 47 clauses on opting out, are so disliked in Scotland that the package has to be sold. Self-governing schools is part of the romantic notion that the Government try to peddle—"Come into the Scottish Office grip and we will give you all the autonomy you want."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone once said—this is slightly cruel—"We have to decide from whom we buy text books." The choice is between the Scottish Office and the present Ministers, extreme as they are, and local education authorities with a proven record of excellence in Scottish education. It is unforgivable for the Minister constantly to talk about local authority benevolence or charity, saying that these authorities are benevolent despots that he wants to break up. We shall soon reach the clause stand part debate when we shall discuss the real agenda behind the clause. If the Government want to put this measure before the Scottish people they should talk about grant-maintained schools rather than self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are worried about two matters. It is only one step on a much longer journey for the zealots on the Conservative Benches. If the Secretary of State made such remarks, there would be more than a hint of reassurance, but when reassurances come from the Under-Secretary on financing and when he says that "self-governing" means some decentralisation and people looking after their own affairs, I do not believe him; nor, it would appear, do educational interests in Scotland, including a vast array of parents' organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that the honourable Gentleman does not hold what I have said in much worth. But if he means that had my assurances been given in the name of my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland he would have been happier, I must tell him that the paper published last December, "Self-governing Schools: Extending Choice for Scottish Parents", was issued by my right honourable and learned Friend in his role of Secretary of State. Those commitments were made by the Government as a whole. Personalising the role of Government is amusing, but if the honourable Gentleman says that he is prepared to accept that what he has learnt in Committee is the way forward for self-governing schools, we shall have made a good deal of progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

nourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Prime Minister or the Andrew Neils of this world -[Interruption.] I apologise, I mean Mr. Neil of The Times. The Minister has a significant influence on educational policy. The Secretary of State for Scotland may be busy with other onerous tasks, but many people in Scotland share my view that this is an ideological Bill full of stolen ideas, against which, we are trying to defend Scottish interests. In view of the Minister's comments, we are glad to have had this minor debate about political honesty and dishonesty. We shall not press the amendment but will allow the business of the Committee to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee very long, but I wish to put on record the fact that I regard the use of the term "self-governing" as a gross exaggeration. The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has already referred to evidence from Dumfries and Galloway, which is hardly a centre of militant Socialism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give us time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a Liberal time coming. Dumfries and Galloway regional council said:
	<br><q><p>"The real test of any educational legislation is whether it will improve the quality of education provided for our young people. The government's proposals do not pass this test."</p></q>
My Highland regional council said:
	<br><q><p>"Theoretically the Government's proposals could result in greater diversity of provision".</p></q>
It continued:
	<br><q><p>"The Government hints at the possible advantages of diversity but does not elaborate on these, other than making vague, unsubstantiated statements …</p></q>
	<br><q><p>In view of the government's intentions relating to the standardisation of curriculum and assessment, and the existence of the national examinations system, it is extremely unlikely that self-governing schools would have significantly greater freedom than they have at present in terms of what is actually taught to their pupils."</p></q>
The Minister said that we had suggested that the Scottish Education Department would become more involved, but it is already involved. The Bill may extend the degree of self-government to allow self-governing schools to hire vehicles or cleaners, but it will make little difference to the education provided to children. It is deceitful to use the term "self-governing". The term "grant-aided" is merely a practical description of the fact that the basis of funding has shifted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9 in page 1, line 18, leave out "hold".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may seem a minor amendment, but a signifi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
cant principle is attached to it. It aims to leave the physical assets of the school under the auspices of the regional education authority—I call it that because I know that the Minister is keen on using the correct terminology. Investment has been made over many years to establish those school buildings. Local communities may have raised funds which have been invested in the building provided by the education authority. We believe that as school buildings are capital assets, funded in part by the rates paid by the local community, they should remain in the hands of the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister emphasised earlier that there will be every opportunity for schools to opt back into the regional authorities. To leave the physical assets with the regional authority would make that much easier. He also emphasised that schools which opt out will be seen to remain part of the educational system. I suggest that ownership of physical assets by the education authority would help that to be understood much more readily by the local community than moving ownership to the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the amendment, if only to encourage the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) to participate in the Committee. However, the amendment will not have the effect that she expects. It removes from the clause the word "hold". It does not change the position in respect of transfer of property, and no doubt the honourable Lady will want to develop that point when we reach it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to accept the amendment, if only to show how flexible and reasonable we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10 in page 1, line 19, leave out
	<br><q><p>"or to keep it efficient".</p></q>
I am recovering from the shock of finding the Under-Secretary of State, the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), flexible in his response, for a change. I welcome his acceptance of amendment No. 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 aims to emphasise the importance of the role of the regional education authority in the schools. Efficiency is important in education. The Minister talks a great deal about efficiency, management and cost-effectiveness. We believe that responsibility for those aspects should be with the education authority. I do not know whether the Minister will accept this amendment on the same basis as the previous amendment and if so, whether his reasons will be different from ours, or the same. I hope that he accepts that efficiency in the education system lies with the education authority and the Scottish Education Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1(4) provides that when a school becomes self-governing, it passes enti-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
rely out of the control of the local authority. That is precisely what we intend, because self-governing schools will offer an alternative to schools under local authority management. Under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, an education authority has a duty to provide efficient school education for pupils in its area. That implies a requirement on the authority to operate each school efficiently while it remains under its management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests that an authority should continue to oversee a school after it has become self-governing. Under clause 7(1), the board of management will have the duty to run a self-governing school efficiency. The head teacher and staff will be aware of the need to maintain an efficiently run school. They will know what resources are available to them. The grant will be fixed each year, and based on the number of pupils enrolled in the school. It will be vital to the success of self-governing schools for them to maintain and expend their pupil numbers. If they fail to attract sufficient pupils, clause 31(3) empowers the Secretary of State to withdraw grant and bring about the closure of the school on the grounds that it has reached the stage at which there are too few pupils for it to provide efficient and suitable instruction at reasonable cost. That would be an extreme sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its day-to-day operation, a self-governing school will be subject to appropriate audit arrangements, which will provide the board of management with information for monitoring efficiency and safeguarding the public money paid to the school. Those arrangements are wholly adequate to ensure that self-governing schools operate efficiently without the continued involvement of education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the education authority should continue to have a duty to provide efficient school education for its area, it does not follow that to achieve that objective, the authority must have a hand in the management of every school in its area. It is not true that the education authority must be a monopoly supplier to provide an efficient service. The reverse is the case. A diversity of schools under independent management should be a stimulus and a challenge to an education authority to make its schools more attractive and create a few magnet schools of its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Fife, Central should tell the Committee about the flagship schools proposed in his visionary way by the honourable Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) as part of the Labour Party's policy review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are supposed to be centres of excellence, beacons to encourage education authorities in England. Are we to be denied such flagship schools in Scotland? Self-governing schools could take on such a role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray is concerned about efficiency within the local authority education system. She should take heart and be encouraged by the signs from Strathclyde, where councillor Malcolm Green and the Educational Institute of Scotland have said that the way to fight the Bill is to ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
education authorities ae more responsive to parents' wishes. The honourable Member for Fife, Central shakes his head, but that was said by Dr. Malcolm Green, the convenor of the education committee of Strathclyde—the largest education authority in Scotland by far. He is right that approach is central to the thinking behind the Bill. Within the constraints of party allegiance, he is honest enough to put that view and deserves credit for being a far-seeing convenor of an education authority. He is responding as I would hope. I trust that that reassures the honourable Lady who is anxious about the efficient provision of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the expresion "magnet schools". That is irrelevant in my part of the country. People will not be attracted to Mallaig from Ullapool, for example because of where they live and work. The expression has little relevance there, but in urban areas, such as Glasgow or Edinburgh, it has a relevance that is damaging to the comprehensive principle. There will be bleeding from difficult areas and a concentration in the best areas. Is that what the Minister means by that expression?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman represents an area that is not typical, although it is a large slice of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman's area is not typical of the area in Scotland where most people live. He talks of upsetting the comprehensive system, but in the schools to which he referred, the comprehensive system made no difference whatsoever. Those schools have a long tradition of drawing pupils of all abilities from their immediate vicinities. I do not expect the honourable Gentleman to defend the comprehensive system against the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is not interested only in his area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman must understand that the Bill is relevant in urban areas where people can choose their schools. The implication of the honourable Gentleman's question was that he was interested only in his own area and I made the point so that he could reassure me that his interest extends to other areas. I note that he is nodding. Now that we agree that we agree, that deals with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the figures off the top of my head, but we shall examine them later. I should be surprised if the parents' charter, which was introduced in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, has not been used by the parents in the honourable Gentleman's area and they have not chosen to use schools that were not their immediate neighbourhood primary schools, for example. That measure was used by 100,000 parents in Scotland, to the advantage of their children, but as opposed by the Opposition, just as they oppose every extension of choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is an expert at reliving history. He always uses the figure 120,000, but he cannot have it both ways. Why does not he mention that the parents of 800,000 children could exercise choice on their behalf? The Minister mentions only 120,000 choices, outwith traditional catchments, out of about 6 million potential choices. That shows that parents do have choice, but very few exercise it. What is the relevance of opting out to extending parental choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a revealing intervention. I said 100,000—the honourable Gentleman said 120,000. He is right, as the figure is 120,000. There is a cumulative total. It is confusing to cite the figure of 800,000. My honourable Friend the Under-Secretary can correct me if I am wrong, but more than 100,000 tenants have bought their homes in Scotland. My honourable Friend would also be astonished to hear the argument that the extended choice on council house sales is irrelevant because the total number is so small. That does not make the policy unworthy. The Govenment gave choice to a proportion of parents who otherwise would have no choice. The honourable Member for Fife, Central says that the Bill is just like that, and will be used only by a few, but people who complain in the butcher's queue and who change their butcher maintain the quality of meat for everyone who attends his shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Excellent analogy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman cares to have a word with the BBC, he will know that I have transmitted that remark to many more millions than he will be able to reach. Giving people the ability to choose within the system is what improves the system. The honourble Gentleman would like all people to be told where to go by education committees run by his party, but that would be neither efficient nor in the interests of parents. I ask my honourable Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that this simple amendment and the lucid intervention by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) gave the Under-Secretary the opportunity to make one of his political preaching speeches. I listened carefully to his response to me, because he referred to clause 7(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties in dealing with the Bill is that we do not know what the Under-Secretary means by "school education" in Scotland. The amendment aims to ensure an overall strategy for Scottish education and to maintain national standards. The Minister offered no reassuance. He did not say that he was considering an overall pattern of education. Parents' organisations have contacted me about the definition of "school education". Clause 11(1) says:
	<br><q><p>"No fees shall be payable in respect of school education".</p></q>
But there are various interpretations of "school education". If the Minister will tell me what it means, I shall be able to decide whether to push the amendment to a vote. Is the Minister talking about a core
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
curriculum? What would that curriculum include? Will music and other subjects that we take as being part of our school system still be available at national standards in every school in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Lady takes to bed with her tonight the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which is a great read, she will see that section 1(5) provides a definition of "school education". It says:
	<br><q><p>"School education" means progressive education appropriate to the requirements of pupils in attendance at schools, regard being had to the age, ability and aptitude of such pupils, and includes</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(i) activities in schools and classes (hereinafter in this Act called "nursery schools" and "nursery classes"), being activities of a kind suitable in the ordinary case for pupils who are under school age".</p></q>
I hope that definition assists the honourable Lady, and that she is prepared to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A reference in the Bill to the 1980 Act would have saved many people much heart searching. However, as I now have a clear definition, and in view of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I do not know whether it is appropriate as a point of order, but I hope that the Minister, who is a stickler for not using waffly words, will ensure that if the clause is to stand part of the Bill, the spelling error in line nine will be corrected. Then, we shall read "maintain" and not "maintain", which would cause confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that will be taken care of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The stand part debate is important because, as in much of the rest of the Bill, a great deal will be left in regulations to be made by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 will involve a substantial transfer of powers from the local community to the Secretary of State. My honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) has mentioned 66. My arithmetic may not be as good as my honourable Friend's, but the Bill certainly gives 50 powers to the Secretary of State. Clearly, the Minister will give us the correct figure when he replies to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members have spoken about the market place, the butcher's queue and competition. One of the benefits of a stand part debate is that we can look beyond the technicalities of the subsections and reflect on the real intention of the clause. We have heard much about how parental choice will be extended—the watchwords of the new Conservative Right—but we believe that the Bill will massively; extend political control. However, some Conservatives, who are not Members of the House, are much more revealing in their comments than the Under-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
Secretary of State and they put the clause's intention into context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</i> of 13 January 1989 and the words of Mr. Douglas Mason, who is a friend of mine, the Minister's and a colleague of the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). Mr. Mason is actively involved in The Adam Smith Institute. I shall give a flavour of his comments about opting out, the future of local education authorities and Right-wing educational philosophy. He says:
	<br><q><p>"There are times in life when you have got to say: 'We've made a mistake, we've gone down the wrong road and we've got to go back and start again'. I think that position is quite clear in education at the moment and there is no shame in admitting to making a mistake".</p></q>
Mr. Mason believes that the present system, both at primary and secondary school levels, has failed to correct the "tragic errors" of the 1960s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not bore my honourable Friends and, perhaps, encourage Conservative Members by reading much more of that diatribe, but Mr. Mason concludes:
	<br><q><p>"There was a clear logic behind parental choice of school, school boards and opting out. The plans for opting out were something of a 'Trojan horse' and would lead to the break up of the present local authority schools structure".</p></q>
I do not hear the cheers that I thought I should. Mr. Mason added:
	<br><q><p>"He thought that as many as a quarter of schools would opt out once parents had been shown a lead."</p></q>
I shall finish with a complimentary remark about the Under-Secretary. Mr Mason said:
	<br><q><p>"Mr. Forsyth was doing 'reasonably well' at the Scottish Office. If anyone could win over the Scottish Education Department and introduce radical reform, he could."</p></q>
That timely intervention by Mr. Mason shows that clause 1 is a Trojan horse in the Government's attempt to undermine Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objective of the Trojan horse was to get inside the walls of Troy. The people hidden in the horse were determined to get inside. The object of the Bill is exactly the opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman may be concerned that 25 per cent, of the schools in Scotland could potentially become self-governing. But the parents will decide. If they think that their schools and their children are doing well and the local authority is looking after their interests, there will be no self-governing schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond to the point about the Trojan horse, without getting too involved in mythology and history. Mr. Mason was talking about local education authority provision and he referred to opting out as the Trojan horse stampeding into that provision. The Government will be able to change Scottish education in the image of the far Right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to respond to the point that will be made constantly throughout the debate, that if parents do not want to opt out, they need not do so. 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> does not favour the Labour party. An article dated 10 August 1988 is topical because the Minister responsible for education in Scotland may be about to embark on a similar exercise. It refers to the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust, the shadowy, parapolitical organisation which fronted the Baker Bill in England. The honourable Member for Tayside, North said that parents could refuse if they wanted. But under clause 1 they will be actively encouraged to opt out by organisations set up and funded by Government. The article states:
	<br><q><p>"Prospectuses listing the attractions of opting out are today being sent to the heads of all 4,000 secondary schools in England and Wales in an effort to maximise the impact of one of the Government's principal school reforms."</p></q>
The honourable Gentleman refers to passive legislation that could be left on the statute book if it is not wanted. But this proposal will be pursued ruthlessly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman consider it likely that schools will opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an ideal political situation with a Government that could be trusted, few Scottish schools, if any, would join the far Right in this experiment. Unfortunately, the political situation is different. We mentioned the funding of schools. After this legislation is established, school closures will be exploited. The honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) made a cutting reference to activities in Strathclyde. The Grant Maintained Schools Trust is pouring out propaganda and, incredibly, Mr. Andrew Turner—working under the distinguished chairmanship of a Member of Parliament— goes up and down England and Wales looking for candidates to come forward for opting out. I sincerely hope that few Scottish schools will, but the Minister is taking so many powers by regulation that what happens today may not resemble the Act that we shall have in one, two or three years' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ignorant—I use the word advisedly, not in a derogatory sense—of the Scottish education system is that it is very different from the English system— 	<i>[Interruption.</i>] The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is murmuring that we want to change it. That is a disgraceful comment in the context of the reply to the honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. We believe that opting out is educationally divisive, and we shall discuss that under clause 2. We are saying that, left to its own devices, this opting-out provision could gather dust on any shelf. But, of course, we do not live in normal circumstances: this Government push the hard Right views that certain membes of the Committee accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by that. The honourable Gentleman has spent the past six months or so telling his people in Scotland that the measure was going to destroy Scottish education and cause immense disruption and that it was a poison being poured into the system. He has been using flamboyant language. Is he telling us that he is now not even prepared to say to the Committee that he believes that a single school will opt out? That seems to be a remarkable change of position from what he has been putting about over the past six months. Is he really saying that such is the persuasive power of the Government that we shall be able to persuade schools to opt out on the scale that he has suggested? Why, then, does he at the same time go round Scotland telling people that the Government are unable to persuade people to come out and support them at the polls? I am sure that there is a conflict in his thinking. What is his party's position? Will the measure be used, or does he think that it will not be used? He really must come clean to my honourable Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rich expression of hypocrisy from the Minister. He may wish to recall a comment made to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> when it was suggested that 10 to 15 per cent, of Scottish schools might opt out. That had emanated from the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the Minister was quick to point out that no such comment was made. The hypocrisy about how many schools will opt out is a matter for the Government. The Opposition do not want any schools to opt out; we are flagging up the position that no one genuinely trusts the Government to handle Scottish education and once the Bill is enacted many things could happen in which democratic accountability in this House will no longer have a role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, the honourable Gentleman said that the figure of 10 to 15 per cent, of schools opting out emanated from the Scottish Office. It did not. There have never been any discussions to which I have been a party in the Scottish Office, and I have never seen any bit of paper, about the number of schools which would consider self-governing status. The figure of 10 to 15 per cent, did not come from the Scottish Office; it came from a press briefing issued by the honourable Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
which stated that we were bandying about those figures. It stated that without any evidence whatsoever and without a shadow of truth. For him then to report stories that he had given to the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> to give substance to his views is extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the honourable Gentleman tell the Committee whether he thinks that any schools in Scotland will opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have referred to the rich expression of hypocrisy—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is interesting to see the animation from the corners of the Room in which the far Right is grouped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government put on record for the Scottish people and for Parliament their reasons for wasting valuable Parliamentary time by introducing an opting-out provision, when not an educational interest in Scotland wants such a measure? I do not want to keep referring to a distinguished Conservative statement from England, but the Under-Secretary must appreciate that genuine consultation on education in the past took years to accomplish. The Under-Secretary is riding roughshod over every conceivable interest. He then has the temerity to ask us how many schools will opt out. Given the overall damage that the Bill will do, that seems entirely academic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend accept that there has never been any discussion with the Minister or any of his officials in the Scottish Office concerning the number of schools that might opt out? Are we to accept that the Minister's memory may have lapsed at some stage? Does not my honourable Friend find it inconceivable that the Government are trying to put a Bill on the statute book, with all that that entails, to allow schools to opt out, yet they have never discussed the possibility of some schools not opting out or considered how many may do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just like council house sales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are involved in here is anything that reflects the market. My honourable Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) makes a valid point. But perhaps we should simply say that we do not believe that the Government are introducing a major Bill in the House to lie dormant on the shelves of the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall not allow the honourable Gentleman to intervene. As I said earlier, we are a tolerant Opposition who allow far Right English Members, who support gifted and able children, to attend this Committee. It is sheer hypocrisy for them to ask how many schools will opt out. The Bill is their dirty work, while we are trying to defend Scottish interests. As my honourable Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, we do not believe that the Scottish Office or the Ministers have no figure for the number of schools that may opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
I hope that, as the debate develops, we shall get some inkling of why opting out is included in the Bill. I am sure that the honourable Member for Eastwood will entertain us by telling us why he wants something that very few other people want. Our position is clear—the Bill is a massive erosion of local democracy. Under the guise of parental choice, the Government are introducing political control. This is not the end of the journey—it is one step towards another goal that the Government are thinking up for the future of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is about improving standards. I want every Member on the Government Benches to say, first, what are the problems of educational standards in Scotland and, secondly, what this mean, miserable Bill will do to enhance attainment in Scottish schools. We have heard that the Bill will improve standards and extend choice to parents. If it is about standards, we have a right to know which standards. How will taking a school out of the local education authority sector improve what most parents want for their children—self development, a decent job and a contribution to society and to economic performance? That is the challenge for the Government. Up to now all we have had are the indulgences of the far Right and the Minister ducking questions about financial systems and who will benefit. I think that the Government should now respond to questions being asked, not in the House, but by parents, teachers, non-teaching unions and pupils throughout Scotland who demand answers before their system is potentially wrecked by the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the clause. Many of the comments of the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) have been very interesting. He suggested that a comparison should be made between the operation of the Scottish and English education systems. A fundamental part of the Bill is that it gives choice to parents. If we talk to parents, we should talk to parents with some experience of education systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members find it amusing that I have had the sort of career that has taken me round the country. That has meant that my children have been educated in many different parts of the United Kingdom, and thus I speak from a unique position as a parent. My eldest daughter began school at Hastings primary school. My first and second daughters continued their primary school education in Birmingham and had secondary education in Durham; one went to grammar school, the other to comprehensive school. On moving back to Scotland, my youngest daughter went to primary school in Blairgowrie, and my two elder daughters to high school. Later my middle and youngest daughters went to high school in Perth. Therefore, as a parent I can speak with some experience as a consumer—the fond word used by the Opposition— or as a customer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my experience, parents are concerned about the quality of education, standards of discipline, codes of conduct and behaviour set in the schools, as there is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
more to education than just learning the three Rs. None of my children has been a disappointment to us academically. Indeed, their degrees are probably better than those of many people who criticise the system. The two eldest girls have very good degrees and we are proud of their achievements - 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I imagine all parents are proud of their children; it would be odd if they are not. I am very proud and fond of my children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are they proud of the honourable Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they are That may surprise the honourable Gentleman. They are not only proud of me, but they respect me, which to me is far more important than any of the nonsense that I hear from Opposition Members. The only people who know one are those who live and work with one. I mean no disrespect, Mr. Martin, as I am sure that your family have the same fond feelings for you as mine have for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point about the clause is that it gives parents the opportunity of choice. It was not until the Government put the parents' charter on the statute book—giving parents the right to move their children—that I exercised my right as a parent because of the problems my children were having. I was first the candidate for the Conservative party, and later the Member of Parliament for the area. Members of Parliament know that our families put up with a lot of aggravation. Many disagree with us, and some actually hate us. Sometimes that is reflected in the playground. If honourable Gentlemen do not believe that that is true they are fortunate. In Blairgowrie, my children were certainly subjected to considerable pressure because they were children of the Conservative candidate, and later of the Member of Parliament. I moved my children. I made use of the parents' charter to move the two girls who were then at school to Perth. I am pleased to say that they integrated well because I no longer represented Perth in Parlt. The boundaries had changed that. That was a choice which we had the opportunity to exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to think that the choice that we are giving to parents in this Bill will help them to choose for their children's future a school where they will not be subjected to pressures, for whatever reason, from a local authority which is conducting a campaign as it is perfectly entitled to do in a democratic society. But there are times when one can see things happening, particularly in the rural community type school of which there are many good examples in my constituency, and I should like the standards, qualities and all the things that matter in those schools to be maintained. If they are maintained there will be no need to exercise the choice in clause 1. In that case, we shall have achieved what is important. We shall have made those who are elected and those who run the education authorities more responsive to the demands, wishes, aspirations and hopes of the parents. That is what education is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Scots grew up knowing that their only escape route was through education. If they wished to make a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
name for themselves in the world and to seize opportunities they had to do so through education. Often the opportunities in the area where they lived were limited to the predominant local industry. The only way that their children could escape from that narrow opportunity was through education. That is why education is important. In my experience, many of the differences that we talk about are on the margins. The things that matter to us about schools are what children will be able to do with their lives and the opportunities that schooling gives them
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a question of academic excellence, important though that is. It is more a question of setting values and standards so that they can grow up to be good citizens and good people, recognising that through their contributions they can get a great deal from life. They have to learn that at an early stage. They should get that through the education system because, sadly, today there are many who no longer set those values at home. The children from those homes depend on mixing with others at school so that they can adopt better values and standards. It is important to give parents choice so that they can determine the future for their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will forgive me if I do not follow his remarks directly. I want to quote fruther from Highland regional council's observations to COSLA and the Secretary of State on the descriptive paper. The difference between the legislation which has finally come forward and the descriptive paper is very limited. These observations set out clearly some of the central arguments which we are beginning to consider in this clause stand part debate. It would be of value to have those views on the record. It would also be of value to have the Government's response as until now, they have had no opportunity to respond to the variety of views on the descriptive paper. The views have been noted, but there has been no real attempt to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Highland regional council, as honourable Members from Scotland will know, is not a political council, although known members of all political parties serve on it. Therefore, it approaches legislation in a pragmatic fashion. Members of the council have no instinctive ideological opposition to what the Government propose, simply because those proposals come from a Conservative Government. The same would be true of their attitude to a Labour Government. The regional council's education committee's report states:
	<br><q><p>"Perhaps the Government has evidence that the developments in administration of Scottish education since the 1872 Act—by which the State openly acknowledged its direct responsibility for educating the people of Scotland—were misguided, but it does not reveal them in its descriptive paper.</p></q>
Paragraph 3,8 states:
	<br><q><p>"The proposals in the descriptive paper appear to be aimed at "turning the clock back" even beyond the 1872–1919 era of the former school boards. These proposals are based on the highly-debatable premise that "local control"—on a school-by-school basis—will result in better provsion of education for the children of Scotland."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
That is the basis of the Minister's argument, which the Secretary of State for Scotland also put forward on Second Reading. The report continues:
	<br><q><p>"Furthermore, in the light of the proposals for the revenue financing of self-governing schools"—which we are dealing with in this clause stand part debate—"it is quite clear that it is intended that such schools will have no more financial freedom in the future than they would have under local education authority management."</p></q>
What is the difference, one may ask? Paragraph 4.2 of the report states:
	<br><q><p>"While the proposals to recover the amount of grant for the running costs paid by the Secretary of State to each self-governing school for education authorities may or may not— depending on their detail—have a significant effect on the majority of schools which remain under local government management, the proposals for capital investment in self-governing schools could have a deleterious effect on the provision available on those schools which will continue to provide for the educational needs of most Scottish children."</p></q>
That is an important point. The proposals make a significant difference and affect not only the school that has opted to be self-governing but, as some members of the Committee have said, others that have decided to remain within the system. The report continues:
	<br><q><p>"Capital projects relating to self-governing schools will be met in full by the Secretary of State after taking into account proceeds from disposal of property directly relating to the school.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>It is at least possible that the Government intends to deduct new capital investment and any capital receipts relating to self governing schools from that available to the statutory education authorities, thus adversely affecting the efforts of these authorities to improve the condition of schools under their management and to devise future programmes for improvement of their existing provision."</p></q>
In other words, the proposals will begin directly to affect the priority system of expenditure that an education authority may wish to set in train. The report sums up by saying:
	<br><q><p>"No attempt is made in the descriptive paper to substantiate the premise that its proposals will result in improvement of the standard of education provided in Scottish schools."</p></q>
That is what it is all supposed to be about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a couple more sentences, and I prefer to quote the report, as I could not express the views in it any more fluently myself. I do not believe in plagiarism. If an argument is the other chap's, it is as well to admit it. The last quotation sums up very well what the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said when concluding his remarks:
	<br><q><p>"The proposals offer parents illusions of 'local control' and 'choice'. In fact, by establishing a direct relationship between the Secretary of State (i.e. central government) and schools they render 'control' more remote from parents than is the case as present.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The key proposal in the paper 'is the change to self-governing status is intended to be permanent'."</p></q>
That refers to the descriptive paper. I think that the Minister suggested that that was not the case when I intervened earlier, but I may not have understood him properly. The report continues:
	<br><q><p>"This statement would appear to express exactly what the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
government is about - a centrally governed system of provision of school education and the demise of any meaningful system of local government responsibility for the provision of education in Scotland."</p></q>
The last part does not hold water because I agree with the honourable Member for Fife, Central that the number of schools that opt out will not be large enough to give general credence to that proposition. The arguments so cogently put by Highland regional council have not been dealt with by an integrated philosophy on the part of the Government, even on Second Reading. I hope that in future sittings, or even at this early stage, the Minister will address those arguments because they are the considered views of the education establishment of Scotland, as the honourable Member for Fife, Central said. They cannot be ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer in a general way to some of the points made by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R Johnston), but I want to return in particular to the speech by the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). It was one of the most pathetic speeches that this or any other Standing Committee has ever heard. On a minor point, he accused me of saying sotto voce, "That is why we want to change it" in reference to Scottish education. What I actually said was, "Is that why the honourable Gentleman does not use the right terms?" It would be helpful if the honourable Gentleman could bring himself to use the correct Scottish term "education authority" rather than local education authority, which is an English term, and if the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) could also use that term instead of regional education authority, which is also incorrect. However, that is a minor point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the honourable Gentleman accept that the proper Scottish term is Labour education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dear, dear. I am sure that if I were to take up that argument, you would rule me out of order, Mr. Martin. It is true that some education authorities in Scotland are controlled by the Labour party and some are not, as the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber said in relation to Highland regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of the speech of the honourable Member for Fife, Central was that the Bill would tear the heart out of Scottish education, but at the same time, he said that it was unwanted and unworkable. When my honourable Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) asked him whether he believed that some schools would opt out, he refused to answer again and again. He cannot have it both ways. If he alleges that the proposals in clause 1 will tear the heart out of Scottish education, he must believe that many schools will opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I turn the question round and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
ask the honourable Gentleman how many schools he thinks will opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment. The honourable Member for Fife, Central says that the Bill will tear the heart out of Scottish education and also that it is unwanted. He cannot have it both ways. Logically, he must take one position or the other, but not both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refrain from using the description that the honourable Gentleman used about my speech. We have to sit and listen to Conservative Members trying to avoid the central issues in the debate. The honourable Gentleman talks about two positions being adopted. We believe that if the legislation is fully implemented, with the active encouragement of the Scottish Office, it will tear the heart out of what we regard as the Scottish education system. The honourable Gentleman says that it is inconsistent to say that there will be minimal damage. We are not being inconsistent. Before the honourable Gentleman wriggles further, will he, unlike the Under-Secretary, tell us why a measure that has no support in Scotland will be implemented against the wishes of all those involved? That is the essential question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman did not make long and meaningless interventions, he would get the answer to that question. I understand from his intervention that he believes now that some schools will opt out. I shall give way to him if he wishes to confirm that. I take it that he is happy to have it on record that I interpret him to believe that some schools will become self-governing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Martin. While we accept that remarks will be made during our exchanges, it is surely incorrect for an honourable Member to state that another honourable Member holds a certain position when it is not clearly identified that that is his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid that I cannot intervene in that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was putting on record my interpretation of the honourable Gentleman's position. If he wishes to put his own interpretation on record, I shall be happy to let him, but it is interesting that he has not challenged my interpretation of his position. The honourable Gentleman said that he believed that schools would become self-governing because—terrible, awful—there would be a campaign in which parents would be told of their options. What a terrible vision— that people will say to parents, "You now have this choice and here are the arguments for," and doubtless the honourable Gentleman will put the arguments against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman is so keen to extend choice, will he allow people to choose whether to pay the poll tax for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows that the strength of my arguments is such that Opposition Members are driven to make interventions on different legislation. I shall limit my remarks to the issues raised by clause 1, noting that the honourable Member for Fife, Central has not challenged my interpretation of his position. The honourable Gentleman does not trust parents to make a rational decision. His position is, "Don't trust the parents, folks. The local authority officials and elected members are always right."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give us his evidence that parents are dissatisifed with Scottish schools, and his evidence about opting-out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the second time, if the honourable Gentleman would stop intervening, I shall come to the point. Opposition Members allege that the Bill is motivated solely by ideeology. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Do they not allege that? I can tell Opposition Members why I was persuaded that these provisions were necessary in Scottish education. It had nothing to do with ideology or with the general reorganisation in Strathclyde regional council, but it was because of some aspects which I thought were unacceptable and which a Conservative Government, who believe in parental choice, should not accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite specific examples. On Second Reading, I referred to Catholic single-sex schools. Let me clarify what happened in the Strathclyde reorganisation proposals. I can quote what Dr. Malcolm Green said on Radio Clyde. The Labour group in Strathclyde regional council took a policy decision that there should no longer be Catholic single-sex schools. That is on the record, but I emphasise that Dr. Green said that he was not in favour of that decision. The listener who telephoned the programme said:
	<br><q><p>"We have been told privately by Labour councillors that this is their policy to remove the choice from parents."</p></q>
I have no particular view about whether single-sex schools are educationally good, but many people believe that they should send their children, particularly their daughters, to single-sex schools. That belief is held in the Catholic community and especially in the Moslem community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an important point. Under the Bill, it would be possible for a school that included boys and girls to opt out of education authority control and then decide to change the characteristics of that school to a single-sex Catholic school, thereby necessitating, say, 150 boys being removed from it. Does the honourable Gentleman agree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making is that parents should have the choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does the honourable Gentleman agree with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should listen. When an education authority deliberately removes education choice from parents, a Conservative Government should offer those parents the choice of continuing with a form of education that they wish to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
have. That is one example, although there are others. There is no doubt that the proposal to close Paisley grammar school was motivated by many factors, including the dislike in some powerful quarters of the form and tradition of education pursued at that school. That matter is not in dispute. It was on that issue, especially, that many people wrote to me asking for provisions similar to those in the present Bill that would give them the choice for the school to become self-governing. They will have that option under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the honourable Gentleman's argument, but he is saying essentially that the Bill could be used as a means of preventing the closure of a school. That seems a fairly negative reason for the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. If an education authority deprives parents of specific forms of education for political reasons or because of specific ideologies, surely it is sensible for a Government who believe in choice to give parents the option of continuing with a certain form of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend recall that one of the first schools in England to opt out was a Catholic school in Lancashire, which was faced with closure by a Left-wing authority? Why should parents of children at a similar school in Scotland be denied the opportunity that was given to parents in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is absolutely right. The Labour party in Scotland wants Scottish parents to be prevented from exercising the choice that is available to parents south of the border. The Paisley grammar episode is another example of the importance of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following carefully the argument of my honourable Friend. Does he recall the attitude of the leader of the Liberals on Strathclyde regional authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had that already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we have never received an explanation of the Liberal party's position. The leader of the Liberals on Strathclyde regional authority wrote to me about the closure of Our Lady and St Francis, which is a fine school in Strathclyde. It has one of the best education records in Glasgow. The Liberal leader said that is was unacceptable that Scotland did not have the necessary legislative powers and that the Government were unable directly to fund that school to enable it to continue. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) told my honourable Friend that such a proposal was negative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is absolutely right. During the debate on the sittings motion, I said that the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) might refer at some length to councillor Mason. At the outset, councillor Mason did not like the principle of self-governing schools, but as a responsible, local regional councillor faced with an unacceptable decision of the Labour-controlled authority, he honourably took the view that it would be right to have the option to opt out in

the case of Our Lady and St Francis. I commend him for showing considerable political courage in taking that stance. When the matter was debated at a recent conference, I gather that, unfortunately, he received a pretty rough reception from many of the ideologues in the party of the honourable Member for Inverness, Nair and Lochaber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Lady and St Francis is a good example of the schools that will be involved. Opposition Members allege that the Bill is all about magnet schools with high-income catchments areas. That cannot, under any circumstances, describe a school such as Our Lady and St Francis. It is an excellent school, located in central Glasgow. Incidentally, the two Labour Members who represent the constituencies in which Our Lady and St Francis are situated were opposed to the proposals, so it is not simply that this is a Conservative ideological proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) suggested that only schools in urban areas would be likely to opt out. The very first school in the United Kingdom to opt out was Skegness grammar school in my county of Lincolnshire—a sparse, rural county. It was hardly a magnet school, and hardly an urban or wealthy area. Therefore, the opportunities that result from the Bill should help rural as well as urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a good point. I have concentrated on urban examples because my constituency is in a predominantly urban area, but my honourable Friend has made the point that the legislation will be of benefit throughout Scotland. The benefit of the clause cannot be measured simply by the number of schools that may take advantage of it. It is also a safeguard. If an education authority knows that those powers are available to parents, that will act as a considerable disincentive to the authority to take action that local parents do not wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Secretary of State act as a safeguard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. In a case such as Our Lady and St. Francis, the Secretary of State has no powers to act.

In another example from my constituency, a village primary school wished to have an extension because it did not want pupils to be bussed to a different town. The regional council refused and said that it would bus the pupils past that school to a different town. I attended a public meeting about that. The possibility of opting-out was raised spontaneously from the floor. I mentioned it to my honourable Friend the Minister, who referred to it on a television programme. Suddenly there was the most remarkable focusing of minds on the issue in Strathclyde regional council. It did a complete U-turn. The local Labour regional councillor for that area—councillor Jimmy MacGuire—was wholly on the side of the primary school, so it was not a matter of party politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the clause is that it is a safeguard for parents, so the success of the legislation cannot be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
measured solely by the number of schools taking advantage of it. It will be a major safeguard when education authorities wish to take actions contrary to parents' wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party cannot stand the idea that the local people might have safeguards against a powerful education authority that takes such action. In the case of Our Lady and St. Francis, the decision was criticised not only by myself but by the Labour party and by the local Labour Member of Parliament. The honourable Member for Fife, Central cannot stand a system that gives little people a bit more choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) thinks that Strathclyde regional council's attempted closure of Notre Dame or Our Lady and St. Francis was out of spite against Catholic schools, he does not know much about the council. The honourable Gentleman avoids mentioning that the region talked about closing schools only because of the immense drop in the rolls and less funding. Hard decisions had to be made about which schools to close. The honourable Member for Eastwood carefully avoided mentioning any of that in his long contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure the honourable Lady on two points. First, I in no way alleged that the decision about Notre Dame and Our Lady and St. Francis represented the regional council's bias against Catholic schools. It did not—it represented a bias against single-sex education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I supported Strathcylde's rationalisation programme and publicly urged the Government to give extra resources to Strathclyde regional council to encourage it to pursue a sensible programme and make necessary improvements to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not find that answer convincing, because the regional council did not have the money to avoid closing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the honourable Gentleman has cleared up the matter of bias, because his earlier remarks implied some deliberate malice against two reputable Catholic schools.

The people of England are not responsible for the Bill being imposed upon the people of Scotland. When I go to various public meetings in England, I find most English audiences sympathetic and kind. They are horrified that the Government, through their Right-wing extremism, use their majority to impose legislation on the people of Scotland. Even people who voted Conservative at the general election, are not necessarily aware of certain Government proposals until they are raised at public meetings. What passes for the national press does not alert people to the injustices that are being perpetrated on Scotland. English people hold as dearly as we do to education values. They also respect Scottish education values and cannot understand why the system that has served us well for so many years will be forcibly altered simply because of the Government's Right-wing ideology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill forces nobody to do anything. Clause 1 will come into effect only because parents will have voluntarily used their freedom of choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have a busy legislative programme pushing through Right-wing legislation. They would not bother to promote the Bill if they took the attitude that it could come into effect or not, according to parental choice. Clearly, the Government hope to use taxpayers' money to influence parents and change the system by those methods because they could not do so electorally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not a single education authority in Scotland is run by the Conservatives. The parents vote for Labour and could vote them out if they so wished, but they have given them increased majorities. That lot on the Conservative Benches cannot stand the fact that they. are unable to change Scottish political opinion and will therefore use other methods to impose their policies.

Tonight the Opposition withdrew one amendment because it was technically defective, but the Under-Secretary accepted its principle, and one amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
was accepted to clause 1. My honourable Friends should not delude themselves that that means the Conservatives are being reasonable because, as we pointed out on Second Reading, they have a recent history of not accepting perfectly reasonable amendments. However, they have become vulnerable to criticism. The public in England and Wales has noticed that the Opposition have attacked their arrogant and triumphal attitudes on numerous other Bills. The Conservative party has gone down in the opinion polls lately and their private polling may have told them to lay off, and that the British people do not like bullying Governments or unreasonable conduct in those who rule over us. Of course, the Conservative party is crafty enough to realise that if it continues to impose outrageously unfair and undemocratic legislation on the Scottish people, the people will out of anger vote nationalist and the Conservatives will be guaranteed another win at the next general election. The Conservatives think that they can have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
