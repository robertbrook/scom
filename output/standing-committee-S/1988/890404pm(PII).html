	<time>Tuesday 4 April 1989</time>
	<p>	<i>(Afternoon)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from column 346]</p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were discussing amendment No. 47. I put forward a reasonable request that the board of management of any self-governing school should be required to enter into an agreement with the education authority on any special educational provision made by that school before it gains its self-governing status, to ensure that such special educational provision continues after the school opts out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the phrase "enter into an agreement" will not trigger a Pavlovian reaction from Conservative Members. As the amendment is worded, the agreement could be mutual. It does not imply an imposition in an undesirable way on a board of management. At the bare minimum, surely Conservative Members will agree that it is important to have an exchange of views and information between the board of management and the education authority on this vital subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say a few words about what would happen if, following the discussions that he wishes to take place, an agreement was not reached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 hope that if the Government put their weight behind requiring such an agreement, the Secretary of State would, in the last resort, step in and make his desires known. There should be a proper, efficient and suitable agreement to ensure that special educational needs are met to the same extent that they were met before a school became self-governing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deliberately trying to be as moderate as I can. I am trying hard to enlist support from the Conservative Benches. We could make the requirement tougher, in that the self-governing school would be obliged, in the last resort, to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
such provisions. If Conservative Members would accept, as a minimum, the need for a dialogue that would ensure the continuance of the provision after self-governing status is reached, we should be making some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, there appears to be a weakness in the amendment, in that if the hon. Gentleman's objective is to ensure that any arrangements entered into are continued and if, hypothetically, the school that opted for self-governing status was unwilling to do so, merely to compel it to enter into negotiations with the local authority would not necessarily have the effect that the hon. Gentleman wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair worry. The amendment requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The board of management shall enter into an agreement".</p></blockquote>
If a deadlock arose between the board of management of a self-governing school and an education authority, the Secretary of State could perhaps step in to ensure that an agreement was reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but the amendment does not say that. It states merely that a
	<br><blockquote><p>"board of management shall enter into an agreement".</p></blockquote>
It is not possible to pass a law to say that an agreement shall be reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the amendments have a flaw or defect, although we support the principles behind them. That is the nature of the resources available to the Opposition. The best spirit in Committees such as this is when the Government accept the arguments and the need for an agreement. If they can think of a better procedure to ensure that, it would be very constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful if my hon. Friend reflects on the distinction between special needs schools and the integration of children with special needs into "normal schools". That distinction is usually missed, so it might be useful to put it on record. We are trying to integrate children into the normal range of activities in most schools, which are dealt with in clause 7, as opposed to the special needs provisions in separate schools dealt with in other clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a profoundly important point. It should be the aim of both sides of the Committee to ensure that children with special needs, whether educational, social of health related, are not segregated. Within the limits of available resources, their needs should be met within the local community. In the care of the elderly, we want to move away from the concept of separate institutions, gathering people from far and wide and segregating them from their local communities. What applies in geriatric social provision should apply as forcefully
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
in education provision, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said. I should have thought that it was the common aim of both sides of the Committee to cater for special needs within a framework that allows the integration of individuals with their fellows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep interrupting, but I seek clarification. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the problem is particularly important in areas such as that which he and I represent, where the population is so thin? The problem of making special provisions is more acute there than in areas of concentrated population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. The problem is not only more acute, but the consequences of failing to make integrated provision to cater for those needs are even worse. If there were no special needs provisions in the community, the distances that individuals would have to travel to receive them would be so much greater and there would be extreme difficulties in contacting relatives. That is why it is a sign of great social progress when local authorities provide such services for individuals with particular difficulties at a local level, be it psychiatric care or, as in the Western Isles, services for those with special educational needs. The amendment deals with those fundamental concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I do not think that he would wish inadvertently to give the impression that special needs schools—I make the same dinstinction as the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish)—cannot be integrated into the community even though their provisions are separate. My experience is that the schools can be integrated. The Isobel Mair school in Clarkston in my constituency is integrated and community organisations are extremely supportive of it. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not say that that could not happen elsewhere and he would not want that to be the implication of his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for steering me away from that implication. It is not what I wished to suggest. We appreciate the efforts made by people working in special needs schools and those of the local community to support and integrate the establishments. However, lack of resources or economies of scale might lead to people of differing communities being drawn into one stablishment, which might be an awful trauma. Even if one succeeds marvellously in building a community spirit around that establishment, the people will not be in their own local community. Our aim is to integrate them there. That is the aspiration in many areas of recent social thinking and it is one that I hope hon. Members on both sides of the Committee support. The provision of special educational needs can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
complex and expensive in terms of time and resources. Therefore, if there is the possibility of a self-governing school steering away from the responsibility of making that provision, it will be tempted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already said that much of the benefit that he sees in the setting up of self-governing schools is that they will be able to cut financial corners here and there—perhaps by abandoning their responsibilities to pay non-teaching staff a decent wage and give them adequate conditions, or perhaps by abandoning their responsibility to provide for children in their locality with special educational needs. The Minister himself has established financial corner-cutting as a prime motive behind the move towards self-governing schools, so we must beware of such motives extending into the area of special educational needs. Children with language and hearing difficulties, for example, need special provision, expensive equipment and expensive teachers with special skills. If that need is to be met by self-governing schools, they will have to incur costs. We should ensure that they do not steer away from their responsibility to meet those costs in their urgent desire to cut financial corners everywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the provision especially relevant in rural communities? Taking your own community as an example, what is the special needs provision? How is it distributed, because you have quite a spread, geographically. Is the provision concentrated in Stornoway, or—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have quite a geographic spread. It stretches all the way up the Campsie hills, but no one lives there. The hon. Gentleman must address the Committee in parliamentary terms. When he says "you", he is addressing the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hogg. I am always forgetting that. Today it must be because I have spent half a day with the Royal College of Nursing. I was asking my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) how special provision is made in a rural community such as his.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the happy developments in the Western Isles since a separate authority was created is that the local government has reflected much more closely the always-existing desire that special needs be met within local communities. The local authority has gone to great lengths to ensure that people with special learning difficulties not only do not have to travel to the mainland, but, where it can be avoided, they do not even have to travel to Stornoway to have their needs adequately met. Specially trained teachers travel round the local schools trying to deal with the problems there. That is vital, because it means that children with those difficulties are not given a further psychological disadvantage by being uprooted from their local communities, away from their fellows, and thrust
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
into what may seem to young people an alien environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that the Western Isles have peripatetic special-needs teachers? Do they go to Barra?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the framework that has been set up in the Western Isles. Its purpose is to ensure that as many of these difficulties as possible are coped with in the local community. Young children growing up in these communities and already facing problems which often have a psychological dimension—find it easier if they are dealt with in this way. The scale of the psychological problems is less than if they had to travel into town—for example, Stornoway—away from their childhood friends, their peers and their school fellows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to retain that system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. It is not only important, it is vital. To move away from the provision that the Western Isles council, for example, achieves, would be a most regressive and regrettable step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even Conservative Members must recognise that for the Western Isles to provide such a service takes planning—to use a dreaded word. Co-ordination of the service is needed to send the teachers round the schools in the Western Isles, covering a distance equal to that from London to Birmingham. There are many logistical difficulties in coping with special educational needs wherever they arise, given the much reduced resources available to local authorities in recent years as a result of Government policies. The council has to plan and co-ordinate carefully. The purpose of the amendment is to achieve such co-ordination and to ensure that everyone and every school in any area plays its part in providing such a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are terribly worried about the service because we can see nothing in the Bill that would prevent a board of management of a self-governing school opting out of the responsibility for it in the future. It is profoundly disturbing that the permission being given to schools to change their character will allow them to stop providing for special educational requirements. A self-governing school that tries to abandon such responsibilities should be required, at the minimum, to consult the local education authority to ensure that pupils who would otherwise be left on one side are catered for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must answer many questions, one of which concerns the expense of providing for special facilities education. The Government might have provided a school with money for a special learning aid before the school opts out or the education authority might have provided such facilities to cater for children with special educational needs. If the school ceases to respond to those needs, what will happen to those facilities? If the school abandons the people in its local area who require those facilities, will it be allowed to keep the facilities that were
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
provided specifically to meet those needs? Will it be allowed to hang on to capital equipment that was provided specifically to meet such needs, or will that equipment move with those who need it and who are decanted from a self-governing school to an education authority establishment? Will the facilities follow the pupils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Govenrment do not agree in principle that self-governing schools should retain a responsibility to cater for special educational needs, we may have to ask the central financial question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to think of examples. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can give examples from his constitutency. I am finding it difficult to think of an example from my constituency. It is easy to think of provision having to be made for itinerant teachers, but if the hon. Gentleman can give an example of capital equipment being provided, clearly it would be a matter of concern if the school subsequently decided not to make the provision but retained the equipment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One simple example is capital expenditure on ramps—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And lifts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hydrotherapy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that ongoing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were talking about the capital equipment and facilities that would be lost if a self-governing school abandoned its responsibilities for children with special educational needs. I cited the example of ramps and lifts that are provided for disabled children. It would be deplorable if taxpayers' expenditure on such facilities came to naught and was rendered useless by a school that had abandoned its responsibilities for such children and did not cater for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I was a principal teacher in remedial education, and had a substantial budget to spend on children with special difficulties. That expenditure covered special reading laboratories and facilities for children with numeracy difficulties. It would be sad if a self-governing school allowed an investment that had been made via ratepayers to gather dust in one of its cupboards. The amendment would ensure that those resources would not be wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I take the hon. Lady's point and I hope that it is well taken by Conservative Members. As she implied, more movable expensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
items of property for children with sight difficulties, such as Braille books, talking talks, special magnifiers and lighting facilities are installed in schools through taxpayers' money to cater for children with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A distinction can be made between types of property. For example, it would be a terrible waste of taxpayers' moneys if, after their installation, ramps and lifts ceased to be used because a school abandoned its responsbilities for children with special educational needs. It would be even more deplorable if a self-governing school could sell such items to raise funds. It would be a shocking abuse of facilities if a self-governing school, which had obtained equipment via taxpayers' money either directly from the Government after it had opted out, or from local government before it did so, abandoned its responsibilities and flogged off those facilities for a quick and dirty profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those worries animated Opposition Members to table this reasonable amendment. We appeal to Conservative Members to recognise the problem, and to join us to ensure that self-governing schools are not allowed to turn away from their doors children with special educational needs. Schools must not allow expensive equipment to gather dust, nor be able to sell it for their own gain at the expense of the children whom it should serve. That danger lies in the Bill, and we appeal to Conservative Members to recognise it and to join us in working out a way to overcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has clearly expressed our worries. We entertain a reasonable hope that the Government will take the amendment on board. Even if they wish to quibble about the wording, I am sure that after my hon. Friend's contribution, they understand the nature of our concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) expressed anxiety about the wording of the amendment, although he seemed to agree with its spirit. If I understood his argument correctly, he said that one cannot predict that any two bodies will enter into an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to Conservative Members if the amendment read, for example, "It shall be the duty of a board of management to enter into an agreement which ensures any arrangements for special education entered into before self-governing status is conferred and continued." We need not quibble about the words; we all understand the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not know before tonight that the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) had such great experience in matters of remedial education. I am certain that she is the only member of the Committee who has, and I hope, therefore, that she will give us the benefit of her experience later. I had been making notes on the subject from a very limited experience of these matters, and the hon. Lady must have much else to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The teachers involved must have special skills and training, and there is a separate qualification for that kind of work. Typically, such work is done in small
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
classes—much smaller than the normal class size, for obvious reasons. Some of the children may have severe behavioural problems and a poor attention span. Some may be unable to sit still—they may be hyperactive and far more noisy than is the norm for young children. Such children can be extremely difficult to teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I did my teacher training several years ago, I sat in with, and tried to help, a teacher with a small class—there were only half a dozen children in it—who were going through some basic spelling work. There were children aged 12 or 13, who could not spell the simple words that seven or eight-year-olds would be expected to be able to spell. For example, they had failed to grasp that the word "rough" is pronounced differently from "bough", although it is spelt similarly. Such children cannot grasp that concept. It might be difficult for 	<i>Hansard</i> to report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take another pair of words as a further example—"seen"—the past tense of the verb "to see"—and "scene"—most children take that distinction in their stride as they go through school, but it is difficult to convey it to children with learning difficulties. Elaborate exercises and plans for teaching must be devised and the matter is often approached as though it were a game, to help the children to gain even a tiny sense of achievement during a lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, it is not helpful that many textbooks printed in England tell us that "law" is pronounced "lore". That is not much use to a Scottish schoolchild who is accustomed to our pronunciation. All those difficulties have to be overcome by specially trained staff and, as my hon. Friend for Western Isles pointed out, there will have to be all sorts of special equipment, which will involve capital costs and running revenue costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not said whether they accept those arguments or if they believe, like us, that it is vital not to neglect those children's needs. When schools opt out, they should not abandon their responsibility to those children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can appreciate that temptations exist for parents who want to give their children every advantage in schools people only by achievers, without learning difficulties or behavioural problems. I know that that prospect appeals greatly to some Conservative Members and one in the Committee has been described as an elitist who favours the gifted and able. We all want to help the gifted and able child but the hon. Member for—I have forgotten his constituency but he is the one with the blue tie in the corner—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). If Conservative Members favour gifted and able children at the expense of those who are not gifted and have little ability, we should like to hear them say so. Their silence is surprising. Does it mean that what we are saying is so obviously true that it is not worth discussing? It would save the Committee a great deal of time if they would tell us that they agree with all we say and will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the blandishments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), it is difficult to resist the temptation to speak on the amendment which is dear to my heart. It may have technical faults, but we must all accept the basic principles that underpin it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to my specialist qualifications, as it is important for the Committee to bear in mind that remedial education is about the integration of pupils with difficulties into our school system. Rather than being separated and sent to different schools, they should be integrated within the system as far as possible. We should offer them specialist assistance to cater for their needs and, we hope, to remedy their problems, which is what "remedial" means, and ensure that those youngsters realise their full potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remedial education was applied in a secondary school and a fundamental aim that we qualified remedial teachers were asked to achieve was that each youngster should reach a basic standard of literacy and numeracy by the time he or she left school. Roughly speaking, that meant reaching a reading or number age of around 12, which professionals assess will ensure that any adult can cope with normal reading matter and basic number work. That may seem a strange definition to Conservative Members but it is the professional assessment made by those most directly involved, not only the United Kingdom but other countries where that speciality is taught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that the reason why many youngsters are faced with those difficulties is not because they have a low IQ, or intelligence quotient, as it used to be called. Many of them have specific difficulties that cannot be diagnosed unless specialist teachers are available in the school system. One example of which many people have become aware through the work of people like Susan Hampshire is dyslexia which, until fairly recently, was not recognised as being a clearly definable problem that has nothing to do with the intelligence of those who suffer from it. We should bear such problems in mind in our discussion of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many circulars have been sent to the Committee, and most seem to be addressed to all members irrespective of the party to which they belong. They have emphasised that the legislation takes little regard of the need for special education. It may be a minority interest, but it demands our fullest attention and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those who aim to work in special or remedial education, there is a separate qualification. A fully trained teacher in Scotland has to take an additional qualification, the course for which is spread over 18 months. It involves a combination of academic learning and practical experience. The sort of skills that I had to learn were the administration of diagnostic tests to establish the difficulty that each youngster faced and how he or she could best be helped. I should be happier if there was more emphasis on diagnostic testing, so that a programme for individuals could be developed, rather than placing the emphasis on normative testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I decided to take on that additional training
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
because I was tired of seeing youngsters being rejected at an early age and often being no more than entertained within the school system because people did not know how to deal wth them. Those specialist skills are vital if youngsters are not to feel a sense of rejection from an early age. We mock the amendment at our peril. There but for the grace of God go you or I. We in the Committee were lucky, as we did not face such problems, but we never know when they might affect members of our family. I hope that every child will be given the specialist assistance that he requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not tie down the hon. Lady to precise figures, but could she give us a rough idea of the number of pupils who have the problems that she described and whom she could help as a trained person? Let us suppose that there is a secondary school with a roll of 1,000. Would it be self-supporting in an efficient way, or would it inevitably have to opt in to the itinerant group of specialist teachers of the regional education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks as he and I share the representation of rural constituencies. In rural areas, there is the concept of the special itinerant teacher. The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) referred to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) asked for the numbers involved. I am trying to remember the days when I taught. The hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) was a colleague at that time, and if he were here, he might be able to assist. The school in which we taught had about 1,800 pupils and I would estimate that in the first year, I taught about 20 to 25 children with English difficulties and roughly the same number with numeracy problems. The numbers declined as we went through the school progression. I had a smaller number in fourth year than in first, I hope because my skills were effective enough to resolve those youngsters' problems, so that they no longer required specialist assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In rural communities, we accept the concept of the itinerant teacher. Over the years, there has been a substantial reduction in the training for, or provision of, remedial education, which causes me great sadness. Of all the areas in which the Government sought cuts, that is the last one that they should have singled out for such severe treatment. The hon. Member for Western Isles mentioned many aspects of the amendment, but he did not refer to the record of needs. A child's record of needs is important because it establishes the difficulties that a youngster may face and his or her potential. The record of needs is usually passed from education authority to education authority should the child's family move from one area to another. It is passed in confidence to the head teacher of the relevant school to ensure that the youngster's education can continue without severe disruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when a school decides to opt out and if it continues to offer a specialist education, the record
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
of needs will be passed in complete confidence to ensure that a child is not disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider how an opted-out school will provide records of needs for its pupils. It is important that we clarify how those schools will look at the needs of youngsters requiring special assistance. I have concentrated on literacy and numeracy because I know more about those matters, but we must consider the integration of physically handicapped children into our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our sitting on Tuesday 21 March in c. 238, the Minister said that he would consider making technical amendments to clauses 28 and 16(4)(b) to ensure that special needs were provided for within schools that had opted out. In replying to this debate on amendment No. 47, will he say whether he envisages being able to include the principles underlying the amendment in those technical amendments? Does the Minister feel, as we do, that an amendment such as No. 47 should be included to ensure that there is continuity of the present provisions in a school that opts out? There should be no abrupt interruption in serving the needs of youngsters who require special education. Special education has many implications and nothing should disadvantage a child who already suffers from severe difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not lay specific requirements upon schools that decide to be self governing to continue the provision of which the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) spoke. We were told earlier that there should be a reference in the Bill, because if there were not it might be decided that the school did not possess such a power. It is my experience, and probably your own, Mr. Hogg that Ministers give assurances such as, "Of course, sensible people will behave in sensible ways. Of course, it is our intention that such and such will happen." But that is no use unless it is written into the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments advanced by the hon. Members who tabled the amendments and the hon. Member for Moray, who spoke so knowledgeably on the subject, were valid. It is all very well the Minister saying that everything will be all right because no one will act in an unfriendly or incorrect way towards those with special difficulties, either mental or physical. But I am afraid that in this hard world—perhaps the Government have contributed to making it a little harder—the measure should be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key to the debate and the amendment is the special education provision that will be in place if schools decide to opt out. As a regional councillor in Dundee I came across a group of parents who were severely disadvantaged because their children were visually handicapped, or blind although the term "visually handicapped" was the one used. At that time, the only provision made for blind children was at the Royal Blind School, Edinburgh, which they could attend from the age of five. Parents took it very hard when they were separated from their five-year-old children who had
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
to go to Edinburgh to receive the school education that the rest of us take for granted our children will get. The children also took that separation hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents organised themselves into a group, which took the title "Sight" and locally to try to make the regional council, as the education authority, provide locally for blind children in the Tayside area. That was successful. The regional council finally agreed to make special provision for blind children both in a primary school and a secondary school. However, that involved the regional council in extra expenditure. It identified a primary school in the city of Dundee, and extra teachers were allocated to that school to try to integrate blind children into a normal school atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional council has also bought additional equipment to allow blind children to carry out work normally pursued by sighted children in that school. Special Braille equipment and magnified visual aids, to make pages easier for partially sighted children to read, have been provided, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with physical education and training. The parents, in conjunction with the regional council, have raised significant funds and spent thousands of pounds to provide soft landing equipment for physical education and training, which enables blind children to take part in normal activities. A normal gymnasium is full of problems that could cause serious damage to blind people. Parents went round pubs, organised bingo and dances and raised thousands of pounds to equip those primary and secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument from the Scottish Education Department was that making provision to educate blind children was so expensive it could not justify duplicating it across the country in every education authority area. The Department said that such education would have to be concentrated within the Royal Blind School, Edinburgh because that was the only way in which value for money could be had. The regional council has had to make special provision in particular schools rather than duplicate the provision within every school in the area. In fact, the school in Dundee now serves the whole of Tayside. People from Angus and Perth go to that school and are happy to do so because they can go home at night and do not have to be boarders at the Royal Blind School, Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen under the Bill's provisions if the majority of parents in those schools decide to opt out and take on self-governing status? Parents of those blind children could vote against such a proposal and find themselves trapped by the majority view of parents of other children and find that their school is self-governing. What will happen to the special provision made available to them inside those schools? Will the board of management have to continue to make the same provision available for those blind children? It will be strange if the Minister says that, because it will mean that a self-governing school, accountable to no one but the parents of its pupils, will be responsible for providing education for blind children, not only in the immediate area but in the whole of Tayside region. It would have a regional responsibility for special education, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
would be accountable only to the small group of parents whose children attended that school, and not to the education authority or parents elsewhere in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, would an education authority have to duplicate that provision elsewhere for parents of blind children who did not want to send them to a self-governing school but to an education authority school? The Minister must clarify the matter. Those circumstances exist in Dundee. Such primary and secondary schools might decide to opt for self-governing status. If so, what will happen to the special units that they provide for blind children? What relationship will they have with the education authority, which has chief responsibility for those units? What control will the education authority have over them? What choice will parents of blind children have in the future? Will they have to send their children to a self-governing school, or will they be able to ask the education authority to duplicate the provision elsewhere, in a local authority school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same problem applies to groups of children other than blind children. For a long time, I worked in a list D school in Dundee, which has now closed. One of the few good things about that school was one of the facilities that it provided for the education authority. Disruptive children who could not be contained within, or would not attend, an ordinary school could attend the list D school in Dundee as a special unit. School refusers and disruptive pupils could be dealt with on a one-to-one basis. The special provision included television, special games and books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such provision is duplicated elsewhere. In Castlemilk in Glasgow, St. Pius school has a similar special unit as, I believe, has Wester Hailes in Edinburgh. Since the closure of the list D school in Dundee, other schools there have taken on that responsibility—for example, Kirkton high school, which is only a few hundred yards from my front door. Extra teachers are allocated and there is also extra expenditure on equipment and facilities such as television and videos, which are needed to try to integrate such children back into normal schools. I admit that there has been much less success with disruptive pupils than with school refusers, but that group of children can benefit greatly from such special units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what provision will be made for those special units if those schools opt for self-governing status? What will be the relationship between those units and the education authority? So far, he has told the Committee nothing about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7(5) refers to the social, cultural, recreative, physical education and training facilities which the self-governing school is to provide. Those facilities can be made available to groups outwith the pupils who attend the school—no doubt to groups who would be prepared to pay fees for the use of such facilities. Indeed, during the break I was in the Tea Room, reading the 	<i>Evening Standard.</i> I came across a photograph showing a line of six debutantes who had just come out of a finishing school for young ladies, in anticipation of attending the various coming-out balls this season in London. No doubt
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
they would be allowed access to the facilities in a self-governing school. It seems strange that Conservative Members can smile upon such activities, but when it comes to special education there is a deafening silence and they refuse to make any commitment to children who suffer in those various ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially, we are talking about minorities—those who may be physically, mentally or visually handicapped, who have hearing difficulties, who suffer from social problems, and the school refusers, and so on. The Bill provides no protection for such groups and means that the arbiters of all decisions will be the parental majorities who may or may not take those groups into consideration. But the Minister is prepared to leave matters in their hands and will not exercise his own muscle or strength in defence of those small groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that any school that opts out must retain its present characteristics, including the provision of a special unit of whatever type. But that does not get round the possibility that the Bill gives, that a board of management can decide to change the school's characteristics at a future date and can decide that these special units will no longer be available at the self-governing school. That is a serious matter to which the Minister must turn his attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before you come into the Room, Mr. Hogg, I heard the Minister say that he never watches television. He obviously follows the advice of the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who tells parents to turn off the box and to read nursery rhymes to their children. I do not know whether the Minister's parents do that to him now when he goes home in the evening. Perhaps it would put him in a better frame of mind. It might encourage him to listen to our serious arguments. He should taken on board the need for care and consideration for minorities, who require special education. We have argued consistently that they are not protected by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Minister will not suggest that it should be left to the boards of management to show the care and consideration that are really his responsibility. Earlier discussions show that many Conservative Members assume that the same boards of management will make decisions about contracts for janitors and school meal staff. That arrangement would result in serious deterioration in wages and conditions of service so that more money could be spent on the education of the children of board members. If that is Conservative Members' view of boards of management, they can hardly expect them to protect the interests of small minorities in schools, especially if it involves schools in incurring expenditure that is seen as detrimental to the majority of children.

During the debates on the Transport (Scotland) Bill, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) did a tremendous double act with the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) about how interested they wre in the transport needs of disabled people in Scotland. They positively dripped concern about meeting their needs, yet this is a much more serious issue. It involves not only the physically disabled but the mentally retarded, the visually handicapped and those suffering from social illnesses. What protection does the Bill provide for them? So far we have heard nothing from the Conservative Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important debate. Opposition Members are not speaking to prolong the sitting as the hours tick away, and to keep Conservative Members up. We genuinely seek a concession from the Minister that the Government will take on board the fact that there is a problem with special education needs, especially in self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not say how special education will be protected and it is incumbent on the Minister to tackle the problem and to make suggestions. If he cannot accept our amendment, he should introduce one that will make the detailed provision necessary to ensure that, irrespective of whether schools opt out of education authority control, not one child who requires special education suffers. Unless the Minister can make such a commitment, he is not living up to his position as the Minister with overall responsibility for education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why a frown comes over your face, Mr. Hogg, whenever I rise to speak. As you know, I am always brief. It is not my nature to be long-winded and to talk for hours. I prefer to be short, sharp and to the point. I have been described as "a man of few words", among other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives me the opportunity to repeat one of the earliest criticisms that I made about the Bill, when we debated the sittings motion. Part of the Conservatives' philosophy is that, apart from a bitter attack on Strathclyde, the debate should be interspersed with the words "parents". We never get to the pupils. I hardly hear the word "child".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is about education rather than an ideological backwater, which is what we get from the Government Benches. It is about provision for children with special needs. We want the Bill to be about educating the children. The amendment is reasonable, perhaps with a grammatical error, and I do not understand why the Minister does not want it. He may say that we should trust the opted-out schools. I accept that opted-out schools will not be motivated by malice or bad practice. But they will not necessarily be motivated on behalf of children with special needs. Financial restrictions will be imposed. If, as the Minister says, the schools are self-governing, they will make their own decisions. Provision for special needs will not have a high priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles said, dealing with special needs requires a high
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
capital investment. We do not need to amend the Bill for such provision to be made. I do not wish to imply malevolence on the part of members of the boards. It is not in human nature to give such matters a high priority; they will be among the first things to go when things get difficult, which will take us back to how it was done many years ago. I remember the special schools; such children could not be integrated and they went to the special schools. Often in such schools were children who should have been taught elsewhere to cope with their special needs. Others were separated out at an early age, but children can be cruel to each other and some were stigmatised. We do not want than to happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) mentioned the children who were entertained in class. That happened regularly. Such children sat at the front of the class in the days when children used to line up and the wee pet was at the back—that was usually me with an apple. They were lined up, defending their exam results. The hon. Member for Moray will remember that at the front were one or two folk who were simply neglected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whoever he was, he did not enter into a special agreement with the education authority, which is what the amendment seeks to provide for. I am sure that the hon. Member will keep to that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has changed is that those children are now catered for. Numeracy and literacy problems were ignored, but now special teachers deal with such problems. We want to ensure that those problems do not happen again. Such children should not once again be neglected and given comics to read while others get on with the serious stuff—not being educated, but being prepared for the qualy. I see that you, Mr. Hogg, remember that as well. We were trained to pass the exams and no special provision was made for those children. That has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great work has been done to help such children with numeracy and literacy. Dedicated teachers spend much time with them and take them slowly through the learning process. In my schooldays, such children were thrown on the scrap-heap to work as labourers in the shipyards of Scott Lithgow and Lamonts—alas, they have gone. I am just about to return to the amendment, Mr. Hogg. I am sure that you do not wish to hear the history of the shipyards of the lower Clyde at this time of night, although they also provided a special need in the university of life. I could tell the Committee many funny stories about Scotts, but I shall refrain from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to return to that era of neglect, which is what the amendment is about. I wish to ask the Minister about one or two specific aspects. Perhaps the hon. Member for Moray can give me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
More details about the record of needs, which is essential to children's education. It is a confidential document and goes with them throughout their schooldays. How many people are involved in the record's preparation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key person involved in the establishment of the record of needs is the educational psychologist, who is generally employed by the regional authority. He would be involved at the instigation of the classroom teacher, who might already have spotted specific problems. The teacher would be consulted during the compilation of the record of needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, other specialised people such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists are involved. The record of needs requires input from several people. Will those arrangements be maintained in opted-out schools? Will a self-governing school go to a local authority to seek advice from an educational psychologist? The answer is probably yes, but will the Minister clarify the position? Will an opted-out school have the ability to involve the local authority in compiling the record? What will happen to the record of needs? Who will be responsible for creating it? That is an important issue. Who will own the record of needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) referred to peripatetic teachers. Will the Minister explain what will happen to them under the Bill? Let us consider specialised teachers who are based at the Nicholson Institute in the Western Isles, but who also have an itinerant function. If that school opted out, what would happen to those teachers' commitments to other schools in the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was using the Western Isles to illustrate an important point on the amendment. We were discussing the itinerant teachers for special needs, and what will happen to that service in opt-out schools. It is possible that the question does not arise: perhaps the Minister can tell me. If a school like the Nicolson institute has special needs teachers who spent part of their time as itinerant teachers in Barra, Liniclate, Tarbet, Daliburgh,
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
Meavaig or wherever, and the school opts out, what will happen to those teachers? Will they still have a commitment to the area? Does the local authority have to provide the service? Does the school enter into an agreement with the local authority? I am sure that is not what the school would want, as the whole purpose of the Bill is to to allow schools to break away from the local authority. Local authority planning would also be required but surely opt-out schools will not be involved in planning because they are to be free-running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles asked whether capital provision within schools will be funded by the local authority. What will happen if a school has, say, a hydrotherapy pool, which represents considerable capital investment, and does not retain its special needs, it opts out, and no longer requires the special equipment? Who will pay for it? What about special hoists, and the occupational therapy and physical training that are available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only when the hon. Member for Moray mentioned the record of needs that I recognised its significance. An opted-out school would not necessarily have the facilities for special needs, but would have to rely on education authorities. An educational psychologist might be needed, for example. We have these schools that are breaking free from the local authority, with one bound, and then we find that they will have to come back to the local authority to ask for help. If the schools are to break free and be self-governing, why do they have to come back to the local authority? They are supposed to be able to handle these matters themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoken about educational psychologists, as I did earlier, but a variety of people may be involved, such as social work departments, which are often contacted, medical practitioners, those providing nursing facilities and others with particular skills who are provided by the local authority to assist in establishing records of needs. Unless a school relies on the education authority and the regional authority, it cannot provide the necessary skills to establish an effective record of needs for children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I have been trying to make. I have not been involved much in records of needs, except for one or two that were highly specialised. I assumed that there would be a large number of people involved, including social workers. An opted-out school will not have the necessary facilities at its disposal, so it will go back to dreaded, hated local authorities—those incompetent groups that are interested only in themselves and their power structures rather in children—and ask them to look after children with special needs. That seems to be a contradiction and I hope that the Minister will explain what will happen to the records of needs. Where will the responsibility lie between the self-adminstering, opted-out school and the child?

You can smile again, Mr. Hogg, as I am about to finish. The amendment is crucial because it concentrates on the child and its special needs.

Unlike the Bill, it is not about ideology or peddling dogma; it concentrates on an important minority within the educational structure. For many years such children have been neglected, but now that excellent methods and provision of education have been established we want to ensure that where a school opts out facilities will be provided locally. Such children should not be bussed to another area, but should have facilities available locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say we should trust opted-out schools. I am not questioning their integrity, but I know what happens in reality. That is why we want to insert a provision concerned specifically with the child and not with the ideology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a major test of the Government's commitment to children with special needs. It is extraordinary that at five past midnight in a Committee dealing with the future of Scottish children the Minister responsible for education in Scotland has not intervened at any stage to say that he will accept what is plainly a straightforward amendment that will give legitimacy to the aspirations of many parents in Scotland who have children with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the excellent features of your conduct of the Committee, Mr. Hogg, is to allow Opposition Members to make points that have been reflected in the debate in Scotland by various organisations. In support of the amendment I quote a letter sent to all hon. Members by the Church of Scotland Department of Education, signed by Alasdair Morton, the general secretary. He makes the point in his letter and report that the department is concerned about safeguarding the interests of children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made a fine point. There are two forms of integration for those with special needs. One is that special needs schools should be fully integrated into the community. The hon. Gentleman's comment was a sound reminder that that must be our long-term aim regardless of whether a school is under the education authority or has opted out. But we are discussing the integration of children with special needs into the fabric of education authority provision which, if the Government have their way, will become the opted-out school sector in some parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reinforce our commitment to the amendment by quoting from another excellent letter from a group called "Sense in Scotland", which is the National Deaf-Blind and Rubella Association. It wrote to hon. Members on 23 March 1989 expressing its concern about children with special educational needs. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
raised this matter with the appropriate Minister through the Scottish Education Department. Rarely do we have such a succinct contribution to our debate. It would be useful to put on record its comments which mirror our difficulties understanding the Government's view on special needs, despite our discussions on clause 2 and parts of clauses 28 and 16. In its paper, Sense in Scotland wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned, however, that provision to be made by self-governed schools for children with special educational needs is not given adequate weight in the proposed legislation."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 47 is designed to elevate the importance of this issue and to legitimise Sense's aspirations. The Government should take its concerns seriously and legislate for that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned that self-governed schools are not to be encouraged to continue and to develop provision for these pupils, nor are they to be encouraged to create new provision by this Bill."</p></blockquote>
That is eloquent testimony to the amendment. It captures the spirit of the Opposition's concern. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would expect that the Secretary of State would wish to protect the interest of children with special educational needs and would reject any proposals to cease making such provision. We would prefer such educational provision in mainstream schools to be positively encouraged and explicitly protected by legislation."</p></blockquote>
That captures the essence of the amendment. This report contains much excellent material and I commend it to all hon. Members, some of whom have received it but have not yet read it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Government to take a significant step forward by accepting this simple amendment. An overwhelming case has been made and it is now appropriate for the Minister to respond. We hope that he will accept the amendment and take this step forward for the many parents and children whom we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Before our period of silence which—as you pointed out, Mr. Hogg—will not be recorded in 	<i>Hansard,</i> I was saying that the hon. Member for Moray raised the matter earlier and did so very succinctly. She obtained a copper-bottomed commitment from me that in addition to the existing provisions in the Bill that provide protection for specialist education and for children with special needs, I would consider an amendment to place a positive duty on self-governing schools to encourage and develop provision for children with special needs. That undertaking was given to the Committee in good faith, and I am slightly surprised that the official Opposition Members have placed so much emphasis on the amendment because the hon. Member for Moray has already covered it and I have already given an undertaking of the sort that the hon. Member for Fife, Central seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the Minister's commitment earlier when I spoke on the amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will almost certainly be introduced on Report, because they may affect earlier clauses which we have already discussed. There is no difference between the Government and the hon. Lady on the matter, and I suggest that the hon. Member for Fife, Central withdraw his amendment on the basis of the undertakings that I have given. He chided me for not getting up to explain the Government's position. I did not do so because it had been explained in an earlier debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can deal fairly speedily with several questions that were raised. I was asked about protections for children with special needs, which are already encompanssed in the Bill. An existing provision relates to the fundamental characteristics of the school. The board of management has a duty to provide suitable school education for all its pupils, including those with special needs. The education authority will continue to have responsibility for the provision of child guidance services for all children in self-governing schools. Furthermore, the education authority will continue to have responsibility for recording special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) asked me who could see the record of needs, who owned it and who was responsbile for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman certainly asked who could see the record of needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My notes show that the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
Gentleman did, but if he did not, I shall not answer the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of needs remains the responsibility of the local authority. Clearly, the regulations will have to be amended, which we shall do to ensure that self-governing schools with a recorded pupil are fully involved in the recording process. The local authority should have a duty to assess children for the record of needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem surprising after such a lengthy debate, but that covers all the questions raised, except the fundamental one on which I have already given a commitment, and the question raised by the hon. Member for Moray. She asked whether it would be practical for a self-governing school to maintain the record of needs. I see no fundamental difficulties in that. As the hon. Lady will know from her own experience, many children with special needs are placed in independent special schools, often run by voluntary bodies. No difficulties have arisen in that respect, and the position in respect of self-governing schools will be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to the subject of children with special needs on Report. This amendment was overtaken by the previous discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister shares my deep concerns on that issue. However, he said earlier that when the technical amendments were brought forward on Report, they would probably include clauses that had already been discussed. Does he anticipate a subsection being written into clause 7 to cover some of the points that have been raised? That is vital as, although there were technical difficulties with the amendment that was moved by the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), a reference to special needs should be included in clause 7. That would satisfy many Members on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that we shall consider placing a duty to encourage and develop provision for children with special needs. That goes considerably further than the amendment, which simply proposes that there should be a discussion and an agreement. That is a long way short of the commitment that I gave the hon. Lady. She would feel short-changed if I accepted the amendment now because it requires a more considered response. I cannot say whether a change will be made to clause 7 or any other clause. The arguments of substance will be carefully considered and there will be an opportunity for further discussion on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the amendments are drafted, will the Minister and his advisers discuss the matters with organisations in Scotland that have specific knowledge of children with special needs?

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of those who have been flitting in and out of the Committee Room, perhaps I should read out subsection (6) to remind them what it is about.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just another aspect of life under the Tories. Subsection (6) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Standards and general requirements may be prescribed to which every board of management shall conform in discharging their functions under this Act."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to allow a debate on the meaning of the standards and general requirements that may be prescribed by the Secretary of State in relation to the functions of the boards of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
The freedoms of self-governing schools, such as they exist under this legislation, will be subject to many limitations. The Minister has told us that self-governing schools will be visited by Her Majesty's inspectorate, which will examine the school education that they provide. They will probably have to meet the standards and requirements imposed on education authority schools. In an earlier debate, the Minister mentioned that boards of management will be accountable directly to the parents who elect them. That will limit further the freedom of boards of management, as they will have to account to parents for all their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said also that only registered teachers will be employed by boards of management in self-governing schools and that those registered teachers will be subject to the standards laid down by the General Teaching Council. The Minister suggested that he would favour a change in those standards by the GTC. In an earlier debate, we learnt that the standards of quality of service that may be insisted on under competitive tendering will be set by the boards of management and may not be the same as those set by the education authorities for the contracting out into which they may be forced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, a series of limitations will be imposed on the freedom of self-governing schools to carry out their functions under the legislation and the Minister has conceded that all those limitations exist. We now need to know what further proscriptions will be imposed on self-governing schools by the standards and general requirements that the Secretary of State for Scotland may demand of them. For example, we know that self-governing schools will be able to become involved in education other than school education and that that will take them into further education and community education, involving all types of education provision, from knitting and basket-weaving to dancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must make clear whether it will be in the Secretary of State's power to insist that when self-governing schools become involved in further education or community eduction, they must ensure that the education that they make available fits into the pattern of overall provision to which the education authority agrees in fulfilling its strategic role as the provider of further education and community education for its area. The Minister suggested that a self-governing school in a prosperous part of town might provide further education classes in Italian, French and German for well-to-do adults who want to learn the language to go on holiday or to take advantage of the integrated market and seek employment elsewhere in the EEC. Such further education provision might be emphasised at the cost of the bridging courses that help people from particularly poor parts of town and from impoverished backgrounds to work their way into O-grade classes, further education classes, or future employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State tell the boards of management in which types of education provision they can and cannot become involved, or will the boards of management be left to pursue their own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
interests and the interests of the pupils and their parents, irrespective of the impact that such action may have on the overall needs of the people in the surrounding area? Are those the sort of standards and general requirements that the Secretary of State for Scotland may impose upon self-governing schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same questions apply to the social, cultural and recreative activities that self-governing schools should be able to promote. I know that the Minister spends much time speaking to religious communities in Scotland and trying to win them over to the idea of self-governing schools. He probably argues that it would be in the interests of Islamic, Catholic or Protestant communities to embrace the concept of self-governing schools in the hope that their religious interests may be advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30. am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be possible for such groups to use the legislation and the boards of management of self-governing schools to create exclusively Islamic, Catholic or Protestant types of social, cultural and recreative activities around the core curriculum? Or would the Secretary of State for Scotland lay down regulations and prescribe standards prohibiting any type of activity involving only people from a particular religion, social group or geographical area? Would he insist on such standards being applied to self-governing schools, or would the boards of management be left free to make whatever provision happened to suit them and the small groups of parents that dominated them, rather than the type of provision that was important to the area in which the school was located?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same may be true of physical education and training. The Minister insisted earlier that any teachers employed for those activities would have to be registered. But a board of management could decide, for some aspects of physical education, to go outwith the teaching profession. It might make an in-house provision and bring in outside contractors to provide sporting facilities for the children. Could the board do that, or would the Secretary of State for Scotland insist that children involved in any sort of physical education or training must be taught by fully qualified PE staff? Or would it be possible for non-qualified, non-registered teachers to become involved in those activities if it suited the self-governing schools to allow that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the self-governing schools draw up contracts, what regulations and standards will the Secretary of State for Scotland insist on? The Minister said that it would be impossible to expect anybody to work for 80p an hour. I suggest that nothing is impossible under the capitalist Scotland that the Minister seeks to create.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I heard the Minister correctly, he never said that that would be impossible. He seemed to think that there are many good people in the world who would take a benign view of such low pay, but we both know that that is not so. He never condemned the possibility of people earning 80p a week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister almost admitted that that sort of thing could happen and dodged the question, as he did with several others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have been far too generous in ascribing the type of sentiments to the Minister that I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is softening up in his old age. It is Scottish Labour Action that is doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that. But I can remember an occasion when I was with my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudon (Mr. McKelvey) in the Members' Lobby. My hon. Friend stopped the Minister and raised with him the case of one of his constituents who, under the new employment training scheme, was working for benefit plus £10 a week. However, because he was denied benefit, he was effectively earning £10 for a 40-hour week. The Minister said that he should be grateful for getting the training at £10 for a 40-hour week. That suggests to me that 80p an hour is significantly more generous than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have conversations between Ministers and other hon. Members being reported by a third party. That amounts to hearsay and would not be in order. I am sure that the hon. Member would not wish to attribute anything to the Minister on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Hogg, which I will follow. I do not wish to attribute to the Minister anything that he would not own up to. When he replies, perhaps he will say whether he finds it acceptable that people should be expected to become involved in training and work for a 40-hour week for £10 and nothing more. I hope that the Minister, who ought to say what he thinks, will say whether the Secretary of State for Scotland will tell boards of management the minimum conditions that would have to apply to contracts in to which they enter with school employees. It has been suggested that, as happens in England, some schools would use pupils to clean classrooms at the end of the day. Would the Secretary of State for Scotland tell boards of management that that would not be acceptable or allowable? Is that the type of intervention that we can expect from him under subsection (6)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether certain books should be allowed in self-governing schools, will the Minister ensure that racist books of whatever sort are not purchased or used in a school's curriculum? This restriction could work both ways. A school might decide that Salman Rushdie's latet book should form an integral part of the English curriculum. Would the Minister tell a self-governing school that the use of such a book should not be permitted there? Conversely, ethnic minority communities find many books offensive. Little Black Sambo-type books are, sadly, available in some schools. Would the Minister tell boards of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
Management that books of that type would be prohibited under the Bill's proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can we expect from the Minister about the use of funds? The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) said that a first principle of these proposals is that self-governing schools should be left completely free to decide how to spend their money. He said that they should have unencumbered freedom to spend money that was allocated to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the possibility of books that could be described as sexist being treated the same way? Unfortunately, schools have used books that implied a passive and diminished role for the female sex and that the role of the male was to be active, powerful and generally get things done. That is not the proper way to educate boys and girls together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to draw my attention to that important point, which I had not considered, although I should have done when speaking of books of a racist nature. Such sexist books were commonly available in Scottish schools when I was at school. I remember them clearly and they had an unfortunate effect on me and others, which can be seen to this day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will remember that in one of the sittings of the Committee that considered the Schools Boards (Scotland) Bill last year, we spent more than a morning talking about "Kes", a book that was not as controversial as some. The Minister got himself into a mighty fankle when he admitted that parents could take the school to court over it. Given that that Bill, which is now the 1988 Act, did not resolve the problem, and that we are further into it with the present Bill, it is down to two or three parents, the simple majority of a board, to stop that type of book being allowed into classrooms. We are talking again of one or two parents, so again there is no democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I remember clearly the long debate about "Kes" in the Committee considering the School Boards (Scotland) Bill last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to forget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right to do so, Mr. Hogg, especially as we are having a long debate tonight. No one wishes a debate to go on at such length at this hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister can spell "Kes". There is no doubt about that. However, the point is that a book of that type, which would not be regarded as controversial by the vast majority of Scottish people, might be thought offensive by the small groups of people in positions of power on a board of management and they could use their influential position to decide whether a book such as "Kes" should be banned even though the book would be available for examination purposes through the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help if we knew the nature of the objection to "Kes". I read it some time ago—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Objections or other matters relating to that piece of literature are a matter of record for the House. It would be unfortunate if the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) recounted those matters now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall cetainly not recount them. I see nothing wrong with "Kes" and never have done. But there are those who find things wrong with such books and they can often find their way into positions of power, as the Conservative Benches show. It is important that the Minister spells out exactly what powers the Secretary of State for Scotland will have to lay down standards and requirements for boards of management, about how they carry out their functions under the Bill. I was dealing with how boards spend their money. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes said that they should have unencumbered freedom to spend the money as they wish and to pursue what he described as value-for-money policies. I assume that that means that they would be free to cut costs wherever they could. What happens if that value-for-money attitude results in the board of management deciding that the pupils' diet is not important and that cheap junk food should be made available, which would free money to be spent on other areas of the curriculum that it considers more important? Would the Secretary of Scotland sit on his hands and do nothing, or would he issue requirements and standards and say that it is vital that the pupils' diet is kept at a minimum level of nutrition, to enable them to take part in school activities?

The Minister must spell out how the Secretary of State would use the powers under the subsection to guide boards of management in the exercise of their functions. If he does nothing and says that boards of management are virtually free to do as they like it could ultimately lead to a deterioration in education generally. The pupils would suffer as a result of the boards being given uninhibited freedom to pursue their obsessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not think that the clause could put a stop to the present arrangements in education where different schools co-operate with each other on the curriculum? Each board of management would build its own initiative, so co-operation among schools would be lost in many areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point and demonstrates his greater experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered most of the points that I wanted to cover on the amendment. I look forward to the Minister's reply and to hearing him spell out how the Secretary of State for Scotland will implement his powers under the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
