	<time>Tuesday 21 March 1989</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sure that the last thing that you want is honourable Members using unparliamentary language. Therefore, I ask you to rule on a term that was applied to some members of the Committee in an article on the back page of the Glasgow Herald on Monday. It was a lonig article headed by large and flattering photographs of four of my honourable Friends—[Honourable Members: "Oh."] They are generally flattering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the article, the author, Mr. Murray Ritchie, described my honourable Friends as "brammers". I understand that there are two definitions of the word. First, there is the neo-classical definition, which is certainly the one to which a scholar, such as Mr. Ritchie, would refer. It comes from the mremonic in logic, bramantip, which is about the application of universally affirmative premises to yield a particular affirmative conclusion. In other words, Mr. Ritchie meant that my honourable Friends were always right. The more popular version defines the term as the bringing together of the abjective "braw" and the noun "mixer" into the word "brammer". That means that my honourable Friends are braw mixers: that is, they are bonny fechters. Therefore, I interpret the article to mean that my honourable Friends are bonny fechters who are always right, so it would be in order to refer to them as "brammers". However, I have checked in "Erskine May" and the matter does not appear to be covered. Lest there be any doubt, will you, Mr. Hogg, rule on whether the word is in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Member for his research because it enables me to say that the matter is not a point of order. Privilege might be involved, so I suggest that the honourable Member seeks the advice of the Privilege Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. As the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has referred to Parliamentary language, would it be appropriate to refer to the four honourable Members as "Maggie's toy boys?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member knows that that is not a point of order, and it is not clear which honourable Members he is referring to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 51 in page 2, line 4, after "State", insert

	<p>No. 52, in clause 2, page 2, line 13, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(c)the local education authority of the area in which the school is situated.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) the head teacher and duly authorised representatives of recognised teachers' organisations; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) the parents of children attending the school".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the amendment will be accepted once the Minister has heard the arguments. The amendment would mean that before the Secretary of State either made or varied an order setting out a scheme of government for an opted-out school, he would have to consult the head teacher, the appropriate teacher representatives, the parents and the education authority. Such wide consultation is vital, especially if we are to take seriously the Government's claim that the measure will devolve power and control from the centre back to the localities where it belongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2, after a successful ballot to opt out, a school will have to make a formal proposal setting out the future arrangements for running the school, the broad policies on admissions, the curriculum, preparation for public examinations and other matters. It should also identify individuals willing to serve as co-opted members on the new board of management. That formal proposal is the scheme of government set out in clause 2 and will include the articles of constitution and articles of management, which are important documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles of constitution will deal with the makeup of the board of management. Clause 3 and schedule 1 specify the detail to be included in the articles of constitution. For example, the board of management will have to have the same number of parent members and staff members as the school board had, and will have to include the head teacher. Appointed members will be specified in the articles of constitution. That will give those framing the articles scope to change the nature of the board of management. Clause 3 provides that the number of parent members must be greater than the number of appointed members, but must not constitute an overall majority. Other than that, it does not specify the number of appointed members that can be included in the articles of constitution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school board of a school with fewer than 500 pupils currently has four parent members, one staff member, a head teacher member and one co-opted member, but under the articles of constitution it could have two co-opted members. Instead of a school
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
board of seven, there would be a board of management of eight. Similarly, a school with between 500 and 1,000 pupils now has a school board of five parent members, two staff members and two co-opted members. Under the Bill, the board could have two additional appointed members, so instead of nine members it would have 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools with between 1,000 and 1,500 pupils currently have school boards of six parent members, two staff members and three co-opted members. The articles of constitution will allow for five appointed members. Similarly, a school with over 1,500 pupils could have a board with six instead of three co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These important changes could be made by whomever frames the articles of constitution. The school with over 1,500 pupils could have a school board with 16 members instead of the present 13. Everybody should be consulted about the choice of those three additional members. As I understand it, the only restriction on the number of appointed members in clause 3 and schedule 1 is that it must be less than the number of parent members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I was looking slightly puzzled, but the honourable Gentleman seems to be dealing with amendment No. 40 and is not speaking to amendment No. 50. I understand his points, but it may be helpful if I say that I am not unsympathetic towards amendment No. 50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he is not unsympathetic to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that it is important to have wide consultation before a decision is made about the additional appointed members to the board of management. For example, the Minister's preference for business people running schools could be reflected in the articles of constitution, without appropriate consultation with everyone involved in the school. To get to the stage of framing the articles of constitution, there need be only a resolution from the previous school board, passed by a vote of four to three, or seven to six, or a request from 10 per cent, of parents that an election be held, followed by a simple majority. Therefore, the articles of constitution could be framed on the basis of the support of only a minority of parents and against the wishes of teachers and staff in the school. Before the articles of constitution are framed and before decisions are taken on issues such as the number of appointed members to the new board of management, it is important to consult head teachers, staff organisations and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 and schedule 1 define most of the terms within which the articles of constitution can be drawn and deal with issues such as vacancies, resignations, dismissals and eligibility. However, it leaves some scope regarding the term of office for those framing the articles of constitution. Schedule 1(4) states that the term of office must be between five and seven years, but it can vary according to who is on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
board. Therefore, whoever frames the articles of constitution may decide that one member on the board of management can have a term of office of five years, that another member can have a term of six years, and that yet another member can have a term of seven years. There should be wide consultation with all those who may be affected before that important decision is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is scope in other areas, for those who frame the articles of constitution to make significant changes to the way in which the school is run. For example, within the articles of constitution it is possible to specify that those who are not members of the board of management can serve on its committees. But, before decisions are made about which non-members of the board of management can take part in its committee structure, there should be wide consultation with the people affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles of constitution specify the delegation of functions to various committees. Again, the decisions affecting that important matter should not be taken lightly or made by only a few people. For example, the board of management will have the right to deal with land and property, the investment portfolio and fund-raising. A board of management may decide to set up a sub-committee with delegated powers to deal with those areas and that only businessmen will be appointed to that sub-committee. Such a decision would be offensive to the vast majority of people affected by the school and there should be prior consultation with staff, parents, teachers and the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board of management must deal with contractual arrangements for staff and teachers. Within the articles of constitution, it may delegate that function to a sub-committee on which staff representatives or head teachers are not allowed to sit. That is another vital area that should be open to public scrutiny and debate before any such decisions are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, regarding a quorum, the articles of constitution will state how many members of the board of management must be present before a decision can be valid. Once again, that affects everyone in the school and the decision should not be made only by those framing the articles of constitution, whether the Secretary of State or members of the previous school board. The articles of constitution can set down the arrangements for election to future boards of management, and such a decision should not be taken without consultation. It would be in order for a board of management to pay its members for attendance and carrying out the board's duties. That could cause great public controversy and lead to boards of management being taken over by small groups of elites who rewarded themselves by paying themselves for the work that they did on the board of management. Those issues cannot be decided without consulting the parents, children and staff who will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles of management will include a description of the school as it is when it considers opted-out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
status. That description will have to encompass admissions and exclusions policies, the appeals procedure, disciplinary matters, staff dismissals and so on. All those issues are vital and must be debated openly by all those involved before they are included in the description and written into the articles of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will no doubt say that any school that opts out must have the same admissions policy as when it was under education authority control. However, under clause 28 a school could decide to change its admissions policy and that change would have to be written into the articles of management under the scheme of government. There should be wide consultation about such a changeover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a board of management decides to change the characteristics of a school by basing the admissions policy on ability and examination performance, that is bound to have an effect on all the other schools in that area. The board should be obliged to consult the education authority because the schools for which the education authority will continue to be responsible will experience the impact of the opted-out school's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a similar problem with exclusions. Those who frame the new articles of management may decide to exclude anyone who poses a discipline problem within the school. Opted-out schools could turn their back on the problems of discipline by expelling troublemakers and dumping them on the education authority, which would have to handle indiscipline alone. That problem has existed in Scottish and English schools for many a long year and will not disappear in the near future. It should be dealt with as a whole within an education authority area. There are some imaginative schemes to deal with disruptive schoolchildren, but they require co-operation among schools. That cannot happen under the Bill, which will allow opted-out schools to walk away from the problem of indiscipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Civil rights are also involved because the appeals procedure will be written into the articles of management. It is important that parents know what rights they and their children have under the terms of expulsion, if expulsion is written into the articles of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms within which the board of management will deal with staff dismissal will also be set out in the articles of management. A group of people must not be allowed to decide, with the Secretary of State for Scotland, how to deal with staff dismissal without involving the representatives of teachers' organisations. It would be ludicrous for the Minister to allow schemes of government for opted-out schools to go ahead without wide consultation with head teachers, parents, teachers' organisations and education authorities. It is simple common sense that if the Minister seriously wishes to listen to local people and give power back to local areas, he must fully involve them in the vital decisions that may be included in the scheme of government set out in clause 2. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How delighted we are to see you in the Chair, Mr. Hogg.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. I can brown-tongue just as well as Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will wish to accept this important amendment because a period of glasnost and perestroika in the Scottish Office has been heralded by the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head, so perhaps we should be sceptical about the new-found openness and co-operation in the Scottish Office. However, it has been well trailed by the Scottish Office and put out in the usual channels that the Minister is so keen to exploit to the full every Monday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the annual conference of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Secretary of State spoke about the new era of co-operation with local authorities, which my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) wishes to include in the Bill. It was reported in a reputable newspaper that at the conference the Secretary of State.
	<br><blockquote><p>"called for an end to past feuding and the start of a new, more co-operative relationship between central and local government."</p></blockquote>
We all say, "Hear, hear" to that. The Minister can put some meat on the bones and give proof of that new relationship by responding well to the amendment. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a speech to which the Scottish Office was anxious to draw particular attention, he insisted that the time was right for a new, improved relationship.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He also reassured councillors that they would continue to play a vital role in Scottish life, and offered detailed consultations over any reorganisations".</p></blockquote>
This is a good time for the Scottish Office to start the new co-operation. It can accept the amendment—as the Secretary of State says—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to forge a better, more co-operative relationship which would be for the good of Scotland."</p></blockquote>
And so say all of us. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State was also at pains to deny that local authorities were being marginalised by the Government. 'I cannot envisage a time when local councils will not have a vital role to play,' he said.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Just as national Government could best express the national interest, so councils could often speak for local communities on matters best determined locally."</p></blockquote>
That is basis of the amendment. It states that local authorities must be consulted. I am sure that the Secretary of State will be pleased to accept that, given his new attitude. It was pointed out in the article that the Secretary of State said that he
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be judged by his actions, not by his words."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
The first action that the Secretary of State can take is to accept the amendment of my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is reported as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We for our part… have taken the conscious decision that the success of some of our most important new initiatives rests on the co-operation of local councils as well as, in some areas, their active partnership."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State has, therefore, given many trails that he is looking for amendments such as those before the Committee to give substance to his fine words at the weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are sceptical about that, because there is conflicting evidence about whether that newfound openness and co-operation will continue. Unfortunately, the Minister of State has now left the Room. Immediately the Secretary of State had spoken to the COSLA conference delegates he came in, baring tooth and claw, and attacked the' very body with which we are supposed to co-operate. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I find it incomprehensible that such bodies should stand back for narrow political reasons from this major national scheme."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary can resolve that conflict by telling us whether he will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a fair amount of sympathy with the underlying principle of the amendment. I thought that the spirit of glasnost was that people rejected state-centred solutions and embraced competition and market choice, which is what the Bill is about. If perestroika means that the Scottish Office is embracing those principles and if the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Gal-braith) endorses that, I am happy to agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that as soon as I rise to speak, the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> immediately disappears from the Room. [Honourable Members: 	<i>"The Scotsman</i> has arrived."] I am told that 	<i>The Scotsman</i> has arrived. No doubt, Opposition Members do not want to be in the position in which they found themselves on Thursday when no amendments that were accepted in Committee were reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate on amendment No. 3 to clause 1, I undertook to consider making a provision that the Secretary of State should consult the education authority before he approved proposals for self-governing status. This group of amendments takes us further, as the amendments require my right honourable and loyal Friend to consult before making any subsequent variation in the scheme of government. We are not discussing variations in the major characteristic of a school: they are defined in clause 28. I hope that the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAl-lion) will forgive me for not doing the same as he did, in discussing virtually everything that relates to the Bill between clauses 2 and 28. I shall stick rigidly to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are other matters in a school's scheme of government, for example, its priorities in admitting pupils, that would be of legitimate interest to the education authority. I am prepared to consider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
that as part of the undertaking that I have already given on amendment No. 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept that the head teacher, the teaching staff and parents have a proper interest in any change in the scheme of government, but surely the honourable Member for Dundee, East will agree that a board would not be well advised to propose any change in its scheme of government without taking full account of the head teacher's views. The head teacher will be a full member of the board of management. Even before incorporation, when the school board is considering proposals for self-governing status, the head teacher will be present and will have the right to offer advice. Equally, the teaching staff will have elected representatives on the school board or the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the emphasis placed by the honourable Member for Dundee, East should be on the teaching unions. The fact that they have elected representatives on the school board means that they are a properly established channel of communication and consultation. It is part of the teachers' representative's job to make sure that he knows the views of those whom he represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to parents. They, too, have elected representatives on the board and the board will have a duty to keep parents informed of its activities. Clause 9 extends to boards of management the present provisions for school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before seeking a change in its scheme of government, a board of management will take care to consult parents. If representatives are doing their job, they will know what the parents' attitude is likely to be. So, although the amendment is not necessary, I shall, in a spirit of glasnost and to help the honourable Gentleman, take note of his argument on education authorities when I fulfil the undertaking that I gave on amendment No. 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recall the Minister's commitment on amendment No. 3, but 1 should like to deal with other matters that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Minister said that changing the characteristics is not covered in this group of amendments, because that is dealt with in clause 28. Will the Minister confirm that the clause 28 procedure requires only that a ballot be held on the change of characteristics and that if a majority vote in favour of the change, that change will be written into the scheme of management? We are interested in that stage of the process. A decision taken after a small majority vote to change the characteristics could be written into the scheme. For example, a school may decide to change from a denominational to a non-denominational school, or from a mixed school to a single-sex school, or from a comprehensive school to one based on academic criteria for admission. Such decisions should not be written into the scheme of management without proper consultation with all those affected. That is the purpose of the amendments.

among a minority of the voting electorate, the decision should not be implemented in the scheme of government unless wide consultation among everyone affected has taken place. The Minister did not deal with that aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not deal with clause 28 because we are not discussing that clause. Any proposal for a change in the characteristics of a school, which is covered by clause 28, requires that the board of management should first consult the education authority. The amendment deals with changes to the scheme of government that are not covered by clause 28, and that do not affect the schools characteristics That is why we are discussing that matter now and that is why I responded as I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister was serious in his reply, he would not object to writing into the Bill a further requirement that education authorities be consulted at this stage. If he is not afraid of such consultation with education authorities, parents, head teachers and staff representatives, nothing will be lost in writing that requirement into the Bill. The Bill will not be diminished by adding such a requirement. But the fact that the Minister resists, suggests that he does not want such consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman reads Hansard, he will find it enshrined in print that I said that there was already provision to require consultation with parents and head teachers. I acknowledged that changes may be made to the scheme of government of a school. They are not covered by clause 28 and do not affect the basic characteristics of a school, but they would be of legitimate interest ot the education authority. I gave the example of a change in the delineated zone of a school. I said that, in considering the undertaking that I have already given on amendment No. 3,1 should seek to incorporate that aspect if the honourable Gentleman withdrew his amendment. That would be the best way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says about and education authority being consulted on any changes in the scheme of government— 	<i>[Interruption.].</i> The Minister said that he will make, or has already made, provision to ensure that an education authority is consulted before any changes affecting it are written into the scheme of government of an opted-out school. If I have misunderstood, I hope that the Minister will clarify his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was promising what he said to the Committee. The honourable Gentleman does not appreciate that the changes in the scheme of government that affect the characteristics of the school are covered by clause 28, which we shall discuss later. That clause requires the board of management to consult the local authority in the way that the honourable Gentleman wishes. However, the amendments would extend consultation to cover changes in the scheme of government that do not affect the characteristics of the school. I said that I should look at that in the context of amendment No. 3, to which I have already agreed, and that should meet the honou
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
rable Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister has moved on the education authorities, but will he also deal with the other aspects of the amendments—for example, on the consultation of staff representatives, parents and the head teacher? I accept that consultation with the head teacher will be less important because he will be on the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the case of staff representatives. Within the articles of management or of constitution, a board of management could decide to delegate functions to a committee on which there are no staff representatives. Decisions could then be taken without the teachers having any say. It is important that the staff are consulted before such decisions are put into effect. It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that there are staff representatives on the board of management because they may not be represented on the delegated committees. In addition, parent members of the board of management may not necessarily be represented on sub-committees with delegated functions and, likewise parents could be excluded from decision making. There must be consultation with parents and teacher representatives before the articles of constitution or management lay out the powers of sub-committees. The Minister must recognise that this might not happen under the Bill as presently drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Minister resists the amendments, because they would not weaken the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has agreed to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is guffawing as though the Minister has agreed to the amendments. He has not agreed to consultation with teacher representatives or with parents. He has agreed that the education authority should be consulted before changes that impact upon the education authority are made, but he has not agreed to consultation over decisions that might effect teachers rights, and that are taken by sub-committees on which there are no staff representatives. The Minister has not committed himself to full consultation with teachers and parents, so I ask him to go a bit further so that their representatives are included in the consultation process. The Minister claims that the Bill is all about parents and children, but he is prepared to allow changes to take place in the scheme of government about which they will have no say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try, in the spirit of glasnost, to be helpful.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked me what I said on amendment No. 3, which he moved. I said:

briefing says to resist the amendment, but if the honourable Gentleman were to agree to withdraw it, we could return to the matter on clause 18 which, as he suggested, might be a more appropriate place. I shall consider the implications of the proposal, but off the top of my head I see no great objection to it. 	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 16 March 1989; c. 59]</p></blockquote>
These amendments make a point of substance about education authorities. I am happy to consider that in the context of my undertaking. If the honourable Gentleman were to withdraw the amendment, we could get on to the next set of amendments, which would enable him to develop his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to withdraw the amendment because I understand the Minister's point about education authorities. I have already spoken about consultation with teacher representatives and parents, which is dealt with in separate amendments and is not covered by the Minister's concession on education authorities. Will he deal with the problem of the exclusion of teacher representatives from board of management decisions affecting teachers under the terms of the articles of management or constitution of the scheme of government? Surely, teachers should be consulted about anything affecting them before that change is put into effect. Similarly, parents should be consulted. It could be argued that, given the nature of the elections, parents will not be properly represented on the boards of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will gladly not press the amendment dealing with the education authority, but not those dealing with parents and teacher representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the honourable Gentleman is not responding to the constructive attitude that we have taken to these amendments. I do not want to go over the same points, but the boards will have a duty to keep parents informed. If a change in the scheme of government were proposed, the board would be expected to keep parents informed on that and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers are unique in that they elect their representatives on to the board of management. Part of their function will be to keep in touch with their members. If the honourable Gentleman's argument were taken to its logical conclusion, every education committee in every authority in Scotland would have to consult all parents and teachers on every decision. That would cause practical problems. The Bill has got the balance right, although I acknowledge that a change in a school's scheme of government may affect the authority, which would not be represented on the board. I am happy to deal with that point in line with my undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments are geared to improving the Bill, so I hope that the honourable Gentleman will acknowledge that that is a reasonable way forward and provides a practical solution to strengthen the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CHANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS OF SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to what is probably the most important clause. We intend to take some considerable time to probe the Government about the implications of clauses 2 and 28 and to seek reassurances about some of the aspects that cause us concern. I hope that this will be a constructive debate about the technicalities of the Bill, but it is important at the outset to highlight our fears about clause 28. For the benefit of the members of the public and the press who are here, I shall attempt to explain the link between clauses 2, 16 and 28, which form the core of our concern and pose a major threat to Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, clause 28 is a powerful threat to equal access in Scottish education. Secondly, it is an attempt to disrupt the cohesive and efficient provision of education authorities. Thirdly, we believe that it restricts the choice of most Scottish schoolchildren and their parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate should identify what the Government mean by academic selection. In the spirit of glasnost that appears to exist this morning—I still wish to use the term—I hope that the Minister will come clean on what we regard as a significant, well conceived backdoor method of reintroducing academic selection into Scottish schools. I have outlined some of our concerns in general terms but we shall seek fundamental assu-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
rances and guarantees on two specific issues— academic selection and provision for children with special needs. Both are emotive and important issues. The debate on clause 1 was in many respects a philosophical debate about choice and interpretation. We are now dealing with the practicalities of the Secretary of State, power to set up grant-maintained or opted-out schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government will respond to the attack by saying that clauses 1 and 28 do nothing more than give opted-out schools the provisions that exist for education authority comprehensive and primary schools. The Government will also argue that any decision taken by an opted-out school will be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State and that it will be left to the parents to decide what changes are made. However, it is important to put on record the complexities of clause 2 and the more important clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, clause 2 establishes a scheme of government for an opted-out school, which will comprise two parts: the articles of constitution and the articles of management. The constitution will cover the composition of the board of management and the articles of management will deal with the functions that it will exercise. However, clause 16 is crucial for the understanding of the measure as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 establishes the scheme of government and gives the Secretary of State the power to vary, by order, the essentials of the articles of constitution and the articles of management. But clause 2 does not allow the Secretary of State to change the characteristics of the school. The linkage between clauses 2 and 28 is contained in the characteristics identified in clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to state what those characteristics are. In the initial submission, a school that is about to opt out must issue a description, stating
	<ol>
	<li>whether the school is an institution for the provision of primary or secondary education or both;</li>
	<li>whether it provides a nursery class; and</li>
	<li>the number of yearly stages of school education it provides;</li>
	<ol>
	<li>stating what provision, if any, the school makes for children with special educational needs;</li>
	<li>specifying any arrangements whereby pupils are admitted to the school by reference to ability and aptitude;</li>
	<li>stating whether or not it is a single sex school within the meaning of section 26 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975; and</li>
	<li>stating whether or not it is a denominational school."</li>
</ol></ol>
It is crucial that clause 28 provides the machinery for changing those characteristics once the school has opted out. Clauses 2 and 16 establish the characteristics for the initial submission to the Secretary of State, which may or may not be approved or amended. Clause 28 then provides the procedure to change those characteristics and that is why it is one of the most important clauses in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also vital to state the specific areas to which we want the Minister to respond. We understand that clause 28 will allow an opted-out school to select on the basis of academic criteria. We debated that on Second Reading. The first essential question that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
Minister must answer is whether clause 28 will allow a school, within a—so far unspecified—period, to change those characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall respond later to the honourable Gentleman's points, but it would help the Committee if the honourable Gentleman said whether he believes that schools should have no provision for changing characteristics and which characteristics they should and should not be able to change. How would the honourable Gentleman provide a mechanism in the Bill to achieve that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 16 would provide that opportunity. We are discussing clause 28 stand part today, but making no decisions, and later we shall table amendments to it that will identify which characteristics can be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Selection is our major fear. Earlier, we asked the Minister to identify schools in Scotland that selected on the basis of academic criteria. There are none in the education authority sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. It depends on what is meant by academic criteria. I can think of two selective schools in Scotland—Douglas academy and Knightswood. At Douglas academy there is a specialist section for musically talented children and at Knightswood special provision is made for children who are talented in dance. The honourable Gentleman told the Committee that he opposes selection, but is he opposed to selection of the sort made by those schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a distortion of our debate. The Minister has frequently given examples of school of dance and others that provide specialisms. I spoke today about selection on the basis of academic ability. That is widely understood in Scotland to mean selecting children on the basis of tests and factors related to their academic ability. It would be useful for the press and the Strangers Gallery if the Committee ceased to hide behind specialist schools. I support specialist schools. Children and young people with excellent ability in dance or music must be able to specialise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Member must not refer to the press or the Strangers Gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies, Mr. Hogg. But they are an important medium for transmitting debate. We unashamedly have put the Committee procedure into a proper perspective. It is vital that the Scottish people learn the reality of the Government's proposals through 	<i>Hansard</i> and the scribblers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. If what the honourable Gentleman says is true, members of the press would have covered last Thursday's seven hours of proceedings from 4.30 pm to 11 pm. Instead, they made no reference to that, and were more interested in the characteristics of members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ing order among members of the Committee, without having to deal with the order and conduct of the press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You can rest assured, Mr. Hogg, that I shall not involve myself in a scurrilous and unprincipled attack on the Scottish media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am tempted to join in the remarks about the Scottish press, but, I shall resist the temptation, just as the honourable Member should resist making more such remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first key issue that we raised this morning was selection based on academic criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order for me to reply to the honourable Gentleman, I must establish his position. He said that he is in favour of schools with specialist provision, but against academic selection. Therefore, the honourable Gentleman would be in favour if a school were to establish specialist provision in dance and music, but if the specialist provision were in mathematics, engineering or classics, the honourable Gentleman would oppose it. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. Allan Stewart	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there was excellence in the areas described by the Minister in his first point, we would support selection, but we are opposed to specialist provision in mathematics, engineering or technical subjects, which does not happen in Scottish schools. The comprehensive system, by definition, does not select on the basis of academic ability and is a successful system. Opted-out schools will provide for academic selection to be introduced. It is not for the Opposition to provide answers, but it is for the Government, and the Scottish people demand answers to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that within the comprehensive sector in Scotland, education authorities provide an integrated, comprehensive and cohesive service for children with special needs. On clause 28 and 2, will the Minister guarantee that special needs provision will be written into the Bill as a priority for every school in Scotland, whether opted-out or within the education authority's sphere of influence? It cannot be right for an opted-out school to fail to provide essential services and facilities for children living within a delineated area even though our parents' charter transcends that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we also want assurances on the sensitive subject of denominational schools. I shall not discuss their merits this morning, but the Churches and many organisations in Scotland will seek firm commitments from the Government that opted-out schools will not be able to change their religious adherence or that non-denominational schools will be able to vote to assume specific religious status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there were a coherent and cogent argu-ments to support that change, consultation with the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
Churches is essential. No consultation has taken place on the initial Government document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we want from the Government a guarantee, without equivocation, that in a delineated area— which is the old-fashioned term for the catchment area of a primary or comprehensive school—any child will have the right to attend a school. If a comprehensive school in Fort William, for example, opts out and bases its admissions on academic criteria, will a child who fails to make the grade have to go to Oban? My geography is a little suspect—the nearest school may not be in Oban—but there are few comprehensive schools in that part of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is concern that children will be excluded from opted-out schools because of behavioural or emotional difficulties. The education authorities - I follow your suggestion, Mr. Stewart, that the term "LEAs" is inappropriate - provide a service though they are responsible for 97 per cent, of children in Scotland's 3,000 schools. They provide a comprehensive service that tackles sensitively the emotional difficulties faced by children. Will the Minister assure the Committee that opted-out schools will have to take the same positive steps to deal with children with emotional difficulties, rather than dump them back on the education authority, which has a wide range of services for those needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My questions to the Minister are not unreasonable. The debate has left unclear the answers to those specific questions. I refer the Committee to the consultative document "Self Governing Schools" sub-headed "Extending Choice for Scottish Parents", which was issued in December 1988. Paragraph 3 deals with statutory controls on self- governing schools. Paragraph 3.3 says that certain matters will have to be included in the scheme, such as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"admission arrangements, where the school is oversubscribed."</p></blockquote>
On page 4, the conclusion of paragraph 3.4 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State would not normally expect to give approval to changes in such fundamentals within the first few years of a school becoming self-governing."</p></blockquote>
So, by the consultative stage, two points were made. The first was that characteristics could be changed, although the timetable was not specified. Secondly, admission arrangements were considered, but it was emphasised that they should operate only where the school was oversubscribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill strikes a blow for freedom of choice, for diversity and for healthy competition. It promotes selection of the best kind—that is self selection. We want to see parents and pupils selecting schools. That is the real issue, not whether schools can select pupils."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol., 148, c. 701.]</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members contend that parents and pupils will not select schools. One group of parents will take a decision at one moment in time, and that will mean the selection of all children for ever more. That is where the essential problem arises with the advoca-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
cy of choice through opted-out schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the report of the Committee's proceedings on 16 March that the lines between my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and the Under-Secretary were fudged in the debate on the guarantees offered. The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) asked about special needs and the Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children with special needs will not suffer from these provisions. On the contrary, the Bill goes to considerable lengths to protect their position."</p></blockquote>
The position is protected in clauses 2 and 16. The characteristics will be the same as those of an education authority school. However, when the provisions of clause 28 are implemented and a ballot is held, a group of parents in an opted-out school may take decisions that will affect other children. That is the real point about the choice. The honourable Member for Moray deserves another answer. We want another statement, not on the initial characteristics, but on clause 28 and the potential for dramatic change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in the same debate, my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East asked the Minister whether the procedure used by the education authority to guarantee access under the parents' charter would continue. The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall give a guarantee about the procedure for admissions, which will be approved by the Secretary of State. The parents' charter will operate."</p></blockquote>
I have already admitted that the parents' charter has worked. It allows choice within the education authority sector, and parents have exercised that choice. If the parents' charter is operational and a school opts out and identifies a set of characeristics that are then changed under clause 28, how can the provisions of the parents charter be reconciled with the provisions under clauses 2, 16(4) and 28?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in that same interesting debate, the Minister said, in response to a question from my honourable Friend the Minister for Dundee, East:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the school is oversubscribed, there has to be an admissions policy. That would give priority to people from the immediate neighbourhood, which is particularly important in rural areas.—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 16 March 1989, c. 117-118]</p></blockquote>
Honourable Members representing rural areas are members of this Committee. Apart from the impact on education generally, there is enormous concern about the impact on rural areas. If the Minister's remarks mean that priority will be given to people from the immediate neighbourhood, which is particularly important in rural areas, he must specify what it is to be and it must be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reinforces our initial questions. Up to now, the debate has been fudged. We have had no specific responses to key questions on opting-out. Not only children who will attend those schools but those who remain within the education authority sector will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
The fears that we have highlighted are not a figment of the imagination of the Scottish Nationalist party, the Social and Liberal Democrats or the Labour party. The Scottish Consumer Council and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council are very concerned about the implications. It must always be borne in mind that Opposition Members try to reflect opinion in Scotland. This is not a political debate with a small "p", because we are discussing serious issues. Parents in the Scottish Consumer Council and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Councils are of all political persuasions. The Bill has proceded as far as this without serious scrutiny of the implications for the categories of children and parents whom I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. Norman Hogg 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued that the onus is on the Government to prove the need for change. Academic studies—I shall not refer unduly to the Centre for Educational Sociology, on which the Minister and I differ about equality, and its contribution to the debate—have proved that comprehensive education, which is non-selective, has improved attainment across all social classes and has equalised achievement and attainment between social classes. The essence of the comprehensive system was an attempt to retain equality, but to narrow gaps in social class achievement. That cannot be dealt with lightly. The Government cannot put a Bill through the House without consultation or considering the benefits of comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to specify for English Members that the Scottish education system is different: we do not have the variety, which clearly is considered a plus point, in England and Wales. Of all children in Scotland, only 3 per cent, go to independent schools; 97 per cent, are within the education authority sector. That underlines the dramatic changes that could ensue if the measure goes through unamended or without the specific guarantees that we seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important debate and I make no apology for taking up so much of the Commitee's time, because I feel strongly about the issues involved. We must stress that because of the lack of consultation, organisations in Scotland expect us to try to use our limited time to probe the Government and obtain assurances from them on specific matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our worries lead us to believe that if clause 28 remains, it will be not only educationally divisive but educationally disruptive. The backing of virtually every education interest in Scotland lies behind the fears that my honourable Friends and I will put to the Minister today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask for three things. First, the best option is for the Government to accept our amendments. The Government should accept that clause 28 should be deleted or significantly amended in conjunction with clause 16(4), which identifies the characteristics that worry us. I concede that some characteristics should be subject to a further debate within an opted-out school, but we remain firm in our opinion of academic criteria for admission and in our belief that priority must be given to provision for special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
The second option open to the Minister is to allow further consultation on the crucial clauses 2,16(4) and 28. As lay politicians, we do not have a ministerial team to advise us. We depend on liaison with organisations in Scotland and accept their wisdom, which reflects public, parental and teachers' opinion. A whole community of education interests has asked us to put forward reasoned amendments. The Minister could accept with great humility that those clauses have enormous implications that must be examined further. A ministerial team, however competent, is not equipped to deal with the implications of measures that could have far-reaching consequences for the future of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third option is to reject the first and second options. I should be immensely disappointed if the Minister did that. He and his honourable Friends have set the tone of the debate, which has been supportive of reasoned argument. That can continue, but only if concessions are made on the crucial questions that we are posing. We expect specific answers, without qualification, in the form of assurances, guarantees or a commitment to build our suggestions into the Bill at a later stage. That is the best way to achieve constructive debate and to show the people of Scotland that someone is listening to and absorbing their concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we should examine what the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has said. It is true that if a provision such as that contained in clause 28(1) is introduced, which provides for parents to have the right to consider changing a school's characteristics, we should debate what it entails. However, the honourable Gentleman's interpretation is somewhat narrow. If parents are to have the freedom, by ballot, to consider changing a school's characteristics, that includes not only selective education but special and denominational education—I noticed that the honourable Gentleman skimmed over the latter issue very rapidly—single sex-schools and the whole range of characteristics that make up a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What free choice is there for parents at the moment, in the neighbourhood comprehensive in Scotland and England? The key to the philosophy of the honourable Member for Fife, Central lies in comments reported not in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> but in 	<i>The Sunday Times.</i> The honourable Gentleman is shaking his head. Did he not say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"if state schools are good enough for Henry McLeish's children, they are good enough for you".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dignify the reporter's scurrilous comments in that article with a reply. If comments in a speech are interpreted selectively, the result may be the unprofessional mish-mash that that article was. If that is the level of personal abuse to which Conservative Members will sink in order to justify the Bill, that is a disgrace. Questions have been asked. I hope that they will be answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I cannot allow the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
honourable Gentleman to get away with that. I am not quoting a scurrilous article written by a scurrilous journalist. The article appeared in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> and it was presumably read by hundreds and thousands of people. It quotes remarks that purportedly come from the honourable Gentleman. I accept that it is possible that journalists get things wrong, that they misquote and that they make a thorough mess of interpreting honourable Member's views and speeches. I have occasionally suffered myself, but I never complain when I am misreported because I am big enough a politician. When journalists, be they from 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> or the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> choose to be insulting, I take it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Fife, Central seems to be very sensitive. Is he saying to the Committee and the hundreds and thousands of people who read the article in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> a couple of days ago that he was misreported? If he was misreported, I accept that. However, the article quotes him as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if state schools are good enough for Henry McLeish's children, they are good enogh for you".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way, because it is an important point for those listening to the Committee's proceedings and for others elsewhere. It is important that they should have some idea about what the honourable Member for Fife, Central is thinking. He said of clause 28(1) that the Labour party rejected, under any circumstances, the view that the Government should enable a group of parents, even after a ballot, to change the characteristics of a school by reference to academic standards or selection on an academic basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article quotes the honourable Gentleman again. I hesitate to use it because it might slander him. It may be scurrilous or it may be correct or incorrect. The honourable Gentlemen have already sent writs to Allan Massie. He is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This party"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Labour party—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is against any idea of selection on the basis of class or race or anything."</p></blockquote>
Logically, "anything" includes religion and parental choice, and it certainly includes Catholic schools. We know that the honourable Member for Fife, Central is not against Catholic schools, but the logic of those remarks covers them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is nice to see that there are people who are listening to the proceedings who might be called journalists. They might not be here at 4.30 this afternoon, and they certainly will not be here at 11 o'clock tonight. They have to go off and photocopy pages from Andrew Roth and fill up their pages that way because they do not know how to do shorthand. It is important

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
that anyone reading the 	<i>Offical Report</i> of this sitting's proceedings should know exactly what the honourable Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Catholic schools represent a form of selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They represent a form of selection, even if selection is made by parents and not the school. That cannot be denied. Would the honourable Gentleman abolish the right granted to parents by the Conservative Government to select for their children a school outwith the catchment area? The honourable Gentleman said courageously that Conservative education legislation in the early 1980s provided that choice. He honourably, openly and honestly said that the Labour party was wrong. He said so last Thursday and again today. We welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the honourable Gentleman accepts that it is right for parents to be able to choose a school outside the catchment area for their child, it is logical for him to accept the provision in clause 28(1). The Labour party is worried that there will be a return not to selection, but to diversity. A range of choices will be available. Not all parents will select a school on academic criteria. They will vote for a school that will take advantage of the opt-out proposals. They will vote for schools offering different styles and characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause offers diversity and choice. It is the logical concomitant of clause 1 and is essential. If the honourable Member for Fife, Central regards the article in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> by Mr. Massie as scurrilous and libellous, I hope that he will issue a writ for libel at the first opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will start by confirming what the honourable Gentleman for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said about the cross-party opposition to the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither of us heard it. I think the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Locha-ber (Sir R. Johnston) for his stately compliment. Will he put on the record the views of Councillor Christopher Mason? I am not criticising Councillor Mason but, faced with certain circumstances, he came to conclusions that are directly relevant to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal briefly with Councillor Mason's main objective of keeping a certain school open. As we recall our own speeches the best,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
the honourable Gentleman may remember his remarks at our previous sitting. He pointed out that the Bill would make it easier for a school to opt out and become self-governing and thus continue to exist even if the local government plan were to close it. To conclude from that Councillor Mason favours the general proposition, which, as the honourable Member for Fife, Central said, goes far wider, is not quite the same. In certain circumstances, it is reasonable for Members of Parliament, councillors and everyone interested in the continuation of the school to object to the proposals—which were probably put forward in good faith, although that can always be disputed—to close the school. Because Councillor Mason used that argument about the school, it does not mean that he supports the Bill's general provisions. I shall expand that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to that. Councillor Mason wrote to me in specific terms saying that the Government should take the necessary powers to fund directly Our Lady and St. Francis so that it could continue to provide its unique education in the east end of Glasgow. We are talking not just about saving a school, but about saving a characteristic of a school. It was a single-sex school and much of the rhetoric from some Labour councillors on Strathclyde was against single-sex schools because they were believed to be anachronistic. That is relevant to clause 28. Councillor Mason was right to urge us to take the measures that we have taken in the Bill. He was critical because our rhetoric did not back our legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can best respond to the Minister by recounting an experience I had long ago. The island of Eigg, which is in my constituency, was taken over by what can only be decribed by a madman. He was a pretty crazy fellow and was mucking up the place no end. I told the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the late Willie Ross, that the only way out would be for the state to take over the island. Willie Ross looked at me from beneath his bushy eyebrows and said, "Does that mean that the Liberal party is in favour of land nationalisation?". The answer was no, but I was rather exposed then because in that specific case, I had proposed that the state should take over the island.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister, who was written to "in specific terms" about a specific case, will understand my analogy. The fact that Councillor Mason was anxious to preserve that school for particular reasons—does not mean that he espouses the general cause that the Minister wishes us to espouse. It is not logical to extend that in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drift of the speech of the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) reflects why some of us are a wee bit troubled that honourable Members representing English constituencies are serving on the Committee. It is not that we dislike them or that they do not have a cornucopia of virtues, but they are not experienced in, knowledgeable of, or sensitive to, the long traditions of Scottish education.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
Education is not usually a matter of major dispute in Scotland. The Minister's proposals represent a tiny minority view. In 25 years, I have never received letters urging the course of action that the Minister now proposes. It cannot be said that if that course were desired, it could not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is a good idea to stir up the question of denominational schools. There are different views on them. The Bill could be regarded as an enabling Bill in that respect. During the attack on the honourable Member for Fife, Central, I was tempted to inquire hesitantly whether the honourable member for Brigg and Cleethorpes thought that denominational education had made a constructive contribution to life in Northern Ireland. I doubt whether it has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman will know that I am chairman of the Conservative Back-Bench committee on Northern Ireland. Nobody would deny that, whatever the awful politics of Northern Ireland, it has one of the best education systems, in both Catholic and Protestant schools, in terms of academic achievement. In that sense, Northern Ireland is an example to us all and I am sure that the honourable Gentleman would acknowledge that denominational schools also have a proud tradition in the west of Scotland. They are part of the culture of that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is wrestling with Lothian regional council and its attitude to parents and politicians in Livingston who wish to set up a Catholic school. Surely, the Bill would give those parents the opportunity to do what they wish for their children, when they are currently being blocked from doing so by Lothian regional council. Its provisions must become law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) continues his speech, I remind honourable Members to keep interventions as interventions and not to make a second contribution to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most appreciative of your protective shawl, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman sees things in terms of challenge and conflict and along rigid lines. I do not suggest that we should proscribe denominational education, but I should like the general drift to be towards integration rather than towards encouragement of permanent separation. If the honourable Gentleman does not understand that, I am not sure whether I can explain it better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer that denominational education did not exist. That does not mean that I should prevent it. However, one of the consequences of the Bill is that it would actively encourage it, and I am not sure that that is the right direction in which to go. In fact, I do not know in which the direction the Government are going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes claim that the Bill is about diversity
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
and widening choice. To me, the Bill appears to restrict choice and to facilitate schemes of selectivity that run against the tradition of Scottish education, although for historic reasons, such schemes have at different times commended themselves to people south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comprehensive education, about which the honourable Member for Fife, Central spoke, is not about the exclusion of excellence. It is about openness of entry and ease of transfer within the system so that people, particularly late developers, are not excluded. I was a late developer myself. I do not want to make a long speech on that subject because the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is not present and I should not like to compete with him in that regard. I am sure that you, Mr. Hogg, would regard that as unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Member for Fife, Central said, a school can become self governing by a simple majority of votes cast, as stated in clause 28(6). There is no mention of a minimum proportion. The Highland regional council drew attention to that fact in its letter of 17 February. It stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the majority to be secured in the postal ballot on a proposal to opt-out should be a majority of all the parents entitled to vote and not just a majority of those actually voting".</p></blockquote>
Again, I bring that point to the Secretary of State's attention because, as the honourable Member for Fife, Central has said several times, there has been no response to the education authorities' painstaking comments on the original paper. No one has paid a blind bit of attention to them. Why were people slaving away in long committees to produce those comments if no one will read or respond to them. This Committee is the only real opportunity for us to ensure that the Minister does respond to what the majority of people in education are saying about his proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the benefit of the Committee, we have received a number of representations in response to the paper. Half the education authorities in Scotland have not yet responded, but all responses will be carefully considered. I have also made the responses available on public record. It is unfair of the honourable Gentleman to suggest that all the representations, whether from individuals or education authorities, have been treated other than with respect. Any points raised as the Bill completes its passage through the House will be taken into account. I have also had meetings with the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland to discuss the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unfair. If the Government intend to respond in detail to all representations, my criticism falls. So far that has not been the case, so it was not so unfair of me to say what I said. If the Minister says that my criticism is premature, I shall look forward to a detailed rebuttal of the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A simple majority of votes cast enables a school to opt out after which the school board must prepare a scheme, presumably again by a majority within the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
majority. That brings it down to about 25 per cent, unless my arithmetic is wrong. That majority will determine the characteristics to be adopted by the opted-out school. There is a great deal more to be said about that issue, but I shall conclude by saying only that I entirely concur with the reasonable and restrained approach of the honourable Member for Fife, Central. It is difficult to amend clause 28 in a way that will prevent the degree of divisivness that could be promoted within the Scottish education system and at the same time will allow the Government to do anything at all. I use the word "could" because, as I said during our previous sitting. I doubt that many schools will take advantage of the provisions. I doubt whether clause 28 can be altered to enable the Government to do what they want and enable the Opposition to block the proposals that we regard as damaging. However, further sittings of the Committee will probably make that clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith (Kincardine and Dee-side)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have had this debate. The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was right to raise the issue in a moderate and constructive way. I have no doubt that my honourable Friend the Minister will reply equally constructively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the honourable Gentleman's views and those expressed by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) because one of my fundamental objections to the Bill, is that it could change the structure and characteristics of school education in Scotland as we have known them for a long time. Similarly to the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, I have no evidence of any groundswell of opinion anywhere in Scotland wishing to change the system. I have received two letters in support of the Bill which refer to the issue of Paisley grammar school, which is understandably strongly supported by my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every other representation that I have received from my constituents and from others throughout Scotland, has questioned the need for the proposals. Here again, I have sympathy with the comments made by the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber. Once changes are made and the can of worms is opened, where can qualifications and restrictions be made to prevent the system from turning into something worse than it might otherwise be? I am worried about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Fife, Central mentioned comprehensive education. It is the traditional system of education that we have had for decades in Scotland. There has never been political controversy over it as there has been elsewhere. I regret any political divisiveness that the Bill initiates on this issue because there has been broad acceptance between the parties and, certainly, across education opinion in Scotland. The most fundamental reason for supporting the system, is that it works. Therefore, I am anxious that we are careful about changing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right honourable Gen-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
tleman aware of the old American expression—if it is not broken, do not mend it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There are also other expressions, one of which I mentioned on Second Reading. I sympathise with the honourable Gentleman's remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my honourable Friend the Minister that we must support excellence in education and variety in our schools. No member of the Committee would wish to do otherwise. I would be glad to see the development of certain specialisations in schools, but that must never be at the expense of the mass of pupils attending that school. Above all, any child who lives within the catchment area must not be denied free and open access to that school. The honourable Member for Fife, Central was right to raise that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 enables a school to change certain characteristics and I would welcome numerous developments, but I hope that my honourable Friend the Minister will assure the Committee that the characteristic of Scottish education that will not be changed, is that those who live within an area served by a school have their free and open access to it, regardless of academic ability. If this debate serves no other purpose than that and my honourable Friend the Minister gives that undertaking I, for one, will be reassured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a general point of principle, but I have the same difficulty as the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber in specifying other characteristics and affects on rural areas and schools. Under the voting procedure to opt out or to change the characteristics of a school, parents of children in local primary schools will have no say. Interference with freedom of access would create horrendous problems. If children of a family in Braemar were restricted entry to a secondary school at Aboyne, they would have to leapfrog over Aboyne to Banchory, some tens of miles further on, which is in a completely different valley on Donside from Alford, or even to one of the closer schools in Tayside, for example to Blairgowrie over the top of Glenshee. That would create horrendous practical problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister does not have that in mind, but that example shows not only the dangers of restriction on access but the practical problems that could arise. I have received many representations from parents and teachers in my constituency and from PTAs. I have met some of them and shall meet more during the next few weeks. Parents of children in primary schools are genuinely worried that under the Bill they will not have a say in the development of the secondary school which their children will have no choice but to attend for geographical and practical reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is crucial because it deals with a fundamental problem. I feel strongly about this issue. We must all ensure that our fears are not justified and that the Bill has no bad effects. I hope that the Minister will give us assurances on this point. I would be surprised if he cannot. I and countless thousands of parents and teachers are looking for his assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition agree with the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). We look forward to the Minister's reply. It might be unusual, but it would be useful to have displayed on the wall a large map of Scotland and a pointer to show some Conservative Members what the honourable Gentleman means by the travelling distance and the awkwardness of journeys. Those Conservative Members probably think that it is no worse a problem than having to go on a slightly longer bus ride than usual. They should know what they are imposing on Scottish children as they wave through the Government's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the honourable Gentleman about special talents. We believe in nurturing special talents, whether they are in music, dance or whatever, but not at the expense of the general school population. As those talents are rare, such children can be drawn from a wide area without much risk of harming the education of the majority of children who do not have spectacular talents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On denominational schools, a problem with having the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) on the Committee is that he blunders in where angels fear to tread. Neither the Catholic Church nor the Church of Scotland will appreciate efforts to blunder into such sensitive areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of the century Catholics in Scotland, particularly in large cities such as Glasgow where that population was building up through immigration, felt that they had to assert their right to equal treatment in education and wanted schools of their own, which they obtained in the Education Act 1918. That feeling was due to religious prejudice, rostered by people—such as those who sit on the Government Benches today—who wanted to wreck relations between Catholics and Protestants in cities such as Glasgow, because it suited their ends to created divisions between those religions. Today, such people put on a face of attempting to stand up for particular rights. That is sheer hypocrisy, given the history and attitude of the Conservative party on the rights of working-class people, whether Catholic or Protestant, in cities such as Glasgow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Benefits can be obtained from single-sex education. Some educationists have argued that girls can benefit because some teachers are prone to pay more attention to boy pupils. Although education research has discovered that, it is not necessarily the answer to how to cater for girls' needs in schools. Other problems are involved in the upbringing and education of girls. To attempt to have a single-sex school where that would skew the entire provision of education for the pupils of the other sex could create a great disadvantage for those pupils, who would have to travel much further to get to their school.

The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes talked briefly about the Government standing up for parental choice. That is the nearest that we have come to an answer from Conservative Members about the purpose of the legislation. Some obvious, plain facts are recognised throughout Scottish society. If parents choose on grounds of academic selection for their able children, the other children in their own family could be disadvantaged—because all children in the same family do not always inherit great academic abilities— and will have to go to different schools. Even if all the children in one family were advantaged, the less able children in the community would have no choice but to go elsewhere. Therefore, children who have been brought up together as playmates from early childhood could be separated—the sheep going to one school and the goats to another. The Government may want our children to grow up in such a society, but we do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents choose single-sex schools, the pupils of the other sex have to travel further to get the same education, and provision is skewed in the local area. If they choose to emphasise a particular range of subjects, those less interested or less able in those subjects are forced to go elsewhere. If they choose to exclude children who need remedial education, those children are forced to go elsewhere. If they choose to exclude children with behaviour problems, those children are forced to go elsewhere. We are talking not about Hobson's choice for those who cannot afford the choice that the Government are imposing on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members genuinely believe that there is strength in diversity. The nature of schools is determined not just by their intake, but by their internal organisation, the ethos of the head teacher and staff and the attitude of the education authority. The question is not only of selecting an intake, but of what to do with pupils when they are in a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about permissive power—the power of parents to decide. If they choose not to, nothing will happen, but if they choose to, something will happen. I am prepared to trust parents. When they vote on a proposal to change the nature of the school, they will take into account the effect on their children and the community. They may have other children in primary schools. Why cannot Opposition Members trust parents to take those factors into account? When parents are asked to make a decision, why do the Opposition immediately say, "Do not trust them. The bureaucracy knows best. We must not allow parents to have a vote on those matters."?

It is significant and refreshing that the Opposition have not commented on or criticised the ballot through which a change in the nature of the school will take place. I assume that the Opposition are happy with the methods to be used and that they accept that the ballot will be democratic and fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

East (Mr. McAllion) has criticised the methods by which parents can decide whether to change the nature of a school, presumably his objection is that the procedure is not sufficiently democratic.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to agree with the view of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council that there should be a two thirds majority of the whole electorate of parents before opting-out is agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just what I wanted to hear. The ballot should be fixed to obtain the decision that one wants.

However, when it comes to a school, the Opposition want to fix the vote so that the majority should be at least two thirds of the electorate. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am happy to give way to the honourable Gentleman as he is continuing to comment, but may I just make my point? Does the honourable Gentleman believe in proportionality?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should gladly concede that there be fewer Labour Members in the House, if there were a directly elected Scottish Parliament sitting in Edinburgh and dealing with issues such as this.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members and journalists will not concentrate on the arguments. The Bill deals with serious education issues about which we disagree. It is not a matter of whether somebody is English, has two Scottish parents of whatever. We should consider the political and education principles involved. I wish to ask some questions and I hope that the Opposition and the press will deal with them. First, what is the nature of the differences between drama, engineering, mathematics and so on when identifying and using as criteria different levels of aptitude? Why is it acceptable to consider aptitude for some subjects but not for others in terms of the intake and internal organisation of a school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As thinking people, I am sure that Opposition Members accept that comprehensivisation is not the last word in education, unless they believe that it is an ideal state and that we have reached nirvana. Perhaps they believe that to be so. I admit—it is a pity that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
none of the journalists covering the Bill has commented on my education interests—that I support the principle and practice of selection by a number of means, including academic criteria, but I note that my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has ruled out, in the first few years, a change of character on that basis. That does not alter my view that it has merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely selection on the basis of a catchment area is a denial of man's right to learn in a different, wider and often more stimulating environment. If we believe in equality of opportunity—Conservative Members genuinely believe in that—it must include the essential element of mobility between areas as well as mobility between ideas. If Opposition Members looked outwards instead of inwards, they would pick up new ideas and open their minds to new concepts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education, like life, is a process of continual assessment and judgment. Conservative Members recognise that individuality is synonymous with diversity. The job of educators is to recognise differences, be they academic, sporting or artistic—I do not accept the categories good and bad—and having identified those differences, develop them. They must help every pupil to realise their skills and to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members must not try to put the education system into a straitjacket; they must not suffocate human nature; they must not force some schools to remain in ghettos or in a ghetto mentality, nor future generations to look inwards rather than outwards. From what I have heard of Opposition Members, I am genuinely saddened by their narrow, inward-looking approach on all matters. They assume that they have nothing to learn from others. They will not adapt to new ideas. They believe that once we have a rigid system, we should stick to it. I want diversity. I want new ideas to be adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to follow the honourable Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos), because I wish to pick up one or two of his comments. He said that Opposition Members attempted to place people in an educational straitjacket. That shows his gross misunderstanding of the present education system in Scotland. As one who has taught in that system, I assure him that pupils are not in an educational straitjacket. There is a great deal of variety, and they can adapt within the course of their education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strengths of the Scottish education system in both schools and further education colleges, is the transferability within our educational institutions, a factor from which the Under-Secretary benefited when at St Andrews university. He changed courses in mid-stream, although I am not sure that we regard his graduation as one of the strengths of our education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a product of the Scottish education system. I went to Arbroath high school, which was a selective, fee-paying local authority school. Is the honourable Lady saying that the pattern of provision in Scotland up to late 1960s is one that she rejects as not being in the Scottish tradition and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
that the Scottish tradition for her is everything that has happened since 1969?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The changes that were enacted in our education system in the late 1960s improved the system in Scotland. Like the honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), I do not believe that children at the age of 11 or 12 should be separated into sheep and goats. The comprehensive system was based on many of the ideas that already existed in rural communities and it was then transferred into cities, to the benefit of communities there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Conservative Members talk about diversity within the Scottish system of education they should try to understand it more effectively. The honourable Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and for Hexham have sought to create diversions rather than tackle essential issues. Rather than speaking to the amendments, they tried to raise points of principle to which they adhere. I do not deny their right to hold those principles, but we are debating the Scottish education system, which has its own principles. The education authorities and those involved in Scottish education have shown that they wish to adhere to the Scottish principles rather than to those enunciated by Conservative Members. Scottish principles include ease of access, transferability and national standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursday evening, I said that our national standards and system related more effectively and easily to the European Community, which will have a major impact on us in the next decade. Perhaps some of our ideas should be transferred south of the border, rather than the other way round. I do not say that in a narrow, nationalist sense but because our education system is so broad based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is about the change in the characteristics of our system, as defined in clause 28. Although the Minister said that our education authorities or regional councils have not yet responded in detail to the Bill, some have responded to the paper that preceded it and have drawn to the attention of the Scottish Office some of their concerns. I shall refer to the comments of Grampian regional council. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R Johnston) drew attention to those made by his regional council. Although he and I have adjoining constituencies, we are in different regional authorities. Commenting on the possibility that the anticipated provisions in the Bill would be similar to those that we are debating today, Grampian regional council said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If some form of selectivity replaces the current Authority pattern of allowing entry to schools then the Authority could be faced with the problem of providing parallel education in what is the catchment area of an opted out school - or providing transport to another school outwith the catchment area."</p></blockquote>
That is of particular concern to those of us who represent rural constituencies. Unlike the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), I shall not take honourable Members on a full geographical tour of my constituency. Suffice it to say that when winter comes, roads in my constituency are among the first to be closed. Our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
travel problems are especially difficult and we are greatly concerned that people will have to move outside their own area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be one of the few remaining Members of the House to have in my constituency one of the unusual schools that youngsters attend from the ages of five to 16. They take their O-grades there and only then transfer to another school. That happens at Tomin-toul from where the youngsters transfer to Speyside High in Aberlour. One of the reasons for that is the extreme weather conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decisions will be taken with the agreement of a simple majority of parents. I take issue with the honourable Member for Hexham on his idea of how a majority is reached. The very minimum should be a majority of all parents entitled to vote. He was wrong to say that Opposition Members had not raised the issue of how the decision would be taken, because several times it was said that it should at least be by a simple majority of all parents entitled to vote. Grampian regional council refers to that in its initial comments. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The possibility that 100 per cent, of a group of parents would wish a particular form of structure is unlikely. If however the majority is such that any vote is sustained by less than 50 per cent, of the total group of parents then the will of the true majority will not have prevailed."</p></blockquote>
That is an important point from an important regional authority, which has developed a series of interesting options within its education provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pursue that point, which I raised in my speech, does the honourable Lady accept that the same principle applies to parly elections? The number of the total electorate that vote for or against a political party is more important than the turnout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike those in the Conservative party, I believe in proportional representation. If we had proportional representation, we should have much fairer representation of everyone in the United Kingdom. Many people do not vote at present as they feel that it is a waste of time because of the overwhelming majorities that some honourable Members— irrespective of party—hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not develop that argument as I am sure that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Hogg. The vital issue is how the decision is reached. We must build in safeguards to ensure that the majority view is taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to explore the role of parents who have children at feeder schools for secondary schools, but that is a matter for a future debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other honourable Members, I attended, albeit briefly because of a constituency engagement, the "Let's hear it from the parents" conference held in Aberdeen. That important organisation has tried to open the debate on these issues to ensure that parents are made aware of the contents of the Bill and can give informed opinions. We all wish to encourage that. So it is depressing that I have a report of that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
conference that shows that the Conservative party has shown some lassitude in taking seriously the comments made by parents. 	<i>The Press and Journal</i> of 20 March states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Raymond Robertson angered many delegates to the National Parents' Conference by dismissing the comments of one parent out of hand—and then leaving without taking part in any workshop discussions."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Robertson may have had another engagement and could not stay, but I understand from reports of that conference that his response to an individual parent was very dismissive and verging on rude. The Under-Secretary may wish to comment on whether that is how he expects consultation with parents to take place. It angered and upset even Conservatives in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not familiar with what went on, but I am familiar with efforts by activists to write to newspapers criticising me for not being able to attend meetings, and involving themselves in dialogue in the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does it not strike the honourable Lady as odd that on a Bill that is dubbed as so controversial and important, so much of the debate is centred on who is a member of the Committee, who went to which meet-ting, and who behaved in which way? Surely that is because the Opposition find it difficult to come up with convincing and coherent arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that future interventions will be relevant to the amendment under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The irrelevancy of the Under-Secretary's comment was a sad reflection on his educational background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Major efforts for consultation are being made. They should be encouraged and should not lead to reports that discourage people from attending conferences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To those Conservative Members who went home gleefully last night because they thought that people in Scotland would know them better than their own constituents as their photographs were published in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> I point out that 	<i>The Press and Journal</i> published a paper last Friday in which people from various parties were allowed to put theri views on the Bill. That paper has tried to be objective in its handling of discussions on this matter and should not be accused of bias.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) raised the issue of special needs in which I have a deep personal interest because of my educational background and professional experience. We tend to think of selection in education as it affects academics. Selection in schools is based on diagnostic testing to enable positive discrimination for youngsters with special needs, especially in reading, writing and arithmetic. I taught those subjects in a secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the lack of attention paid to the need to expand remedial education services. It is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
essential to have remedial teachers in secondary schools, but it is also vital that every primary school has a full-time remedial education teacher. If special needs children are helped at an early stage, they will be able to develop their capacity for learning and be part of the overall pattern of education. Remedial education should be available within schools and such children should not be singled out and sent to the oder type of remedial schools. They should be part of the overall school community. That should be encouraged. I hope that the Under-Secretary will deal with this issue, because I am not satisfied that special needs are taken account of in the opting-out legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to remedial education, but there are moves to include physically handicapped children in ordinary schools. The Spina Bifida Association commented on choice for Scottish parents. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a group, parents are essentially selfish, concerned only with the needs of their own children."</p></blockquote>
I do not agree with that, but the association is putting its view starkly to emphasise its point.
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present, when a handicapped child is educated in a standard school there is no animosity because the Local Authority usually increases resources to compensate. Thus individual children are not adversely affected. However the Government's proposals create a climate of conflict. Resources spent on a handicapped child's education seem to incur a loss for the others. It will be very hard to persuade a School Board to spend more on the handicapped child when it will mean less for the children of the majority, since any Board who went against majority wishes could find itself thrown out of office."</p></blockquote>
None of us want that to happen, but special needs or handicapped children may live in an area where schools have opted out of the system and such provisions may not be available because of costs or lack of understanding. We spoke about the wishes of the majority, but the rights of the minority should also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond to this matter. It is not a party political issue but concerns all of us. We should work to improve the provisions for such children. I support the amendment, but I shall listen with interest to the response of the Under-Secretary, especially on the effect on rural communities and children with special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Committee, a certain vigour of language is in order, as is customary, but Opposition Members such as the honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) clearly said that Conservative Members are responsible for sectarian strife. When I wished, politely, to intervene to suggest that the honourable Lady might reconsider that remark, she refused to let me do so. That is beyond the pale of normal Parliamentary debate and courtesy. I wish to put on the record that the Conservative party has an outstanding record in rejecting sectarianism. Sectarianism is not an issue in Scottish political debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) in no way made denominational education, whether one is a Protestant or Catholic, a party-political issue. It was the honourable Member for Maryhill who tried to raise that issue in such a deplorable way. My honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes pointed out the importance of choice, which is why denominational education is relevant to the debate. I wish to put that important point on the record because the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lo-chaber (Sir R. Johnston), among others, raised the issue. The debate is not about whether one is in favour of denominational education which provides an important element of choice in Scottish education. Parents can choose to send their children to schools that have a particular religious emphasis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes said that denominational education provides not only an element of choice but, by definition, an element of selection. The system is selective because it makes a form of education available to parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the Committee understands that religion is not a criterion for selection in the Scottish education system. Anyone can go to a Catholic school. In my constituency large numbers of non-Catholics attend Catholic schools, but make no commitment to the Catholic church. No one is selected for entrance into a Catholic school on the basis of being a Catholic or a Protestant.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman had read my previous speeches on this debate, he would recall that I specifically made the point that Notre Dame, and Our Lady and St. Francis, represent not only choice for Catholic parents, but an element of choice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is why the issues raised by these two cases go to the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber is not present because he did less than justice in the debate to his Social and Liberal Democrat colleague, Councillor Christopher Mason. I recall that Councillor Mason criticised the Government for not introducing opting-out proposals. He did not argue that such proposals which already existed should be used, but criticised my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) for not introducing them. He favoured their introduction because of his circumstances. He has some experience of those matters because he was also a member of the board of governors of Jordanhill school. One can argue that that is an opted-out school, because it has a direct relationship with the Scottish Office. In the spirit of making constructive contributions to the debate, I hope that the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber will consult Councillor Mason, who has a fund of valuable experience to give to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend for Kincardine and Deeside made a number of general points. Our opinions differ and I represent a primarily urban constituency. My right honourable Friend rightly referred to the problems of Paisley grammar school. I accept that his education authority has not pursued some of the policies pursued by Strathclyde that have led to my involvement.
