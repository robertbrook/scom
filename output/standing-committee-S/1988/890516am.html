I wish to refer to a matter that arose at our previous sitting. When I expressed anxiety about the impact of city technology colleges on the education of girls, the Minister said that one CTC in Birmingham has a woman principal. If that was an attempt to reassure me, the Minister is more easily satisfied on the subject than I am, because I have since found out that other city technology colleges are still at the project stage and that of the 14 project directors, only one is a woman. The Minister has not dealt with my anxieties properly. Will he look into the matter again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows the Secretary of State to introduce appraisal schemes for teachers and lecturers. Amendment No. 246 and the substantive amendment, No. 247, extend the clause to cover corporate colleges as well as further education colleges managed by the education authority. Self-governing and maintained schools are covered already. The amendments make common sense and correct an anomaly in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

regulations are introduced to appraise teaching staff in further education colleges managed by education authorities, they should also apply to corporate colleges that will remain in the local authority sector for finance and planning purposes.

Therefore, I am happy to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Schemes for the appraisal of teaching staff must be part of a coherent and negotiated programme of staff development.".</p></blockquote>
There is a danger, in discussing this amendment, that we may stray into the clause stand part debate, so I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue is to ensure that any discussion of teacher appraisal is seen against the background of staff development. In the aftermath of the teachers' dispute, discussions ensued in the Scottish joint negotiating committee and then appeared in Government circulars. In Scotland, there has been a debate about staff development, and most of the teaching unions and education authorities accept that it is a crucial part of a modern, progressive education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emphasis in the consultation paper issued by the Scottish Education Department in February is slightly worrying because, although appraisal is seen as part of staff development, there is an increasing stress on the importance of appraising teacher performance. The amendment will ensure that teacher appraisal forms part of a wider staff development programme; be that in the Scottish Education Department, the education authorities or the teaching unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stand part debate will hinge on the fact that teacher appraisal can be approached in two ways. If it is conceived as part of staff development, most people will accept that some form of appraisal is necessary, especially if it identifies the strengths and weaknesses of an individual teacher. Appropriate resourcing and teacher support will then be given by the education authorities if that is agreed by individual staff members and the teaching unions. However, staff appraisal could be conceived in a way that would make Scottish teachers and education authorities apprehensive. That would occur if staff appraisal was seen in isolation from the wider staff development issues. In that process, appraisal could lead to consequences that would not be in the interest of staff members or the children whom they teach. The distinction between the two approaches will be made clearer during the stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will ensure that everyone understands that the appraisal of teachers is only one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1379</span>
element of a wider staff development programme. On the stand part debate we shall also discuss the fundamental distinction between dealing with issues at a local level through discussions between teachers, their representatives and the education authorities, and the imposition of national principles and regulations, which would lead to uniformity throughout Scotland and which would not be in the long-term interests of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman accepts the need for appraisal, but is he suggesting that action following appraisal can be taken only through negotiations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to elicit. Appraisal should be a teacher-based process and should deal with the quality of teaching and the contribution that a teacher makes to his class and school. If appraisal was used to seek easy ways of dismissing teachers or for other objectives, that would be profoundly worrying. Later, we shall also consider that teachers and those who are appraising them have a duty to be built into a contract. Therefore, we must emphasise the issue of partnership. There is a danger that increasing centralisation of power and increasing stress on the national dimension will affect that important partnership. In the aftermath of the teachers' dispute, most people agree that partnership must be developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, there is a need for partnership, but I am anxious to avoid woolly thinking and to elicit rigorous dissection of the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to work with teachers, but if we accept the principle of appraisal—that may be a considerable move forward for the Labour party—we must accept that it may result in disciplinary action being taken or reward being given. That cannot always be achieved by negotiation. The buck must stop with somebody, be it the education authority or the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman specifically emphasised the need to take action after negotiation. That does not happen in other professions, so why should it happen in the teaching profession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several issues arise on that. The first base in the negotiating procedure should be deciding what staff appraisal is about. The hon. Gentleman asked whether appraisal should be based on discipline or reward. That worries us, because it is the wrong way to tackle teacher appraisal. If it is not seen against the wider backcloth of staff development, single aspects, such as reward and punishment, are taken in isolation. That is not the spirit in which any form of teacher appraisal should be considered. That is why in the clause stand part debate we shall raise more doubts about the Government's plan to develop the appraisal of teachers in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman is saying that teacher appraisal should result only in staff resource
	<span class='label label-info column'>1380</span>
allocation and that after all the business of teacher appraisal the teacher remains in place and is neither rewarded for good work nor—vice versa—punished for bad work; he is simply allocated more resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more questions the hon. Gentleman asks, the deeper the hole he digs for himself. He must understand what teacher appraisal is about. It is clear from his comments that he has homed in on discipline and reward. That is entirely the wrong way to go about improving staff development. The hon. Gentleman will gain much if he listens a little longer to comments on what is happening in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already a great deal of appraisal in Scottish schools. The Minister smirks and shrugs his shoulders, but he is ignorant about what is happening in Scottish schools. Although his advisers inform him about some activities, it appears that he is not aware of the best practice in Scottish education, where teacher appraisal has gone on for 20 or 30 years in several forms. The essence of the sensitivity of the subject is that appraisal of teachers cannot be considered unless it is couched in terms of staff development. That is what the amendment is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly because our aim does not require much explanation. I hope that my comments will help the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must distinguish between deliberate acts of will and failure due to genuine difficulties. If a teacher chooses not to perform properly or fails to carry out his duties, that should be a matter for disciplinary action, as in any other job. But some teachers, especially new teachers, have problems in controlling classes effectively. Often new teachers have great difficulty, especially if they are landed with the most difficult classes that more senior and experienced teachers are glad to get rid of. After years spent obtaining a degree and doing teacher training, it is difficult for teachers to admit openly that they have difficulties, especially to those supervising them. The problem can worsen to the point where a new teacher is utterly miserable in the job and considers giving it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an appalling waste of public money and does no good to either the teacher or the pupils in his care. There should be a system of assessment to pick up and deal with those problems, whether or not the teacher is able to admit to them. It should not be a punitive system whereby, if a teacher cannot cope, he is out the door, but one which helps a teacher to overcome his problems. If he can do that, he can be an effective teacher for the rest of his working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitude expressed by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle was that there could be only discipline or praise; he did not mention improvement. Teachers would accept that in the context of a negotiated system if it was a means not of heaving them out the door but of helping them to do more effectively the job that they were trained to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1381</span>
The amendment is reasonable and sensible and I hope that the Minister understands what we are aiming for, even if some Conservative Back Benchers do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment. Appraisal would be virtually pointless if it were not carried out in the context of identifying and meeting the staff development needs of teachers. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to point out to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that the purpose of appraisal is to identify strengths and weaknesses and deal with them through the management process. If appraisal is not carried out in that context, it is a pointless exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made that point in relation to schools in our current consultation paper, "School Teachers' Professional Development into the 1990s". No organisation embarks on a system of staff appraisal unless it intends to make use of the results. That is why the consultation paper canvassed the introduction of a scheme of in-service training vouchers to provide teachers with a means of meeting their personal needs in a way that can provide an incentive to teachers and that supplements policy-led in-service training. I did not think that we should be in a position to introduce education vouchers for teachers, but that is what the paper suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am able to assure the Committee that regulations that have to be laid under clause 64 will require the wider staff development context to be made clear, but that is not the whole picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also make it clear that regulations are unlikely to require negotiation—in the collective sense—as part of any scheme, whether it be between the Secretary of State and education authorities, or between teachers or lecturers and their employers. After all, it has been as a result of leaving the issue to negotiation that Scottish education has made so little movement in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central said gaily that Scotland had 20 years' experience of staff appraisal and that my advisers must have failed to inform me of important developments, but he did not tell the Committee where the sensational progress had been made. I am not aware of any such progress. Over the past few years there has been nothing but fudge and mudge and pious declarations of hope, with very little being achieved. That is why we felt obliged to introduce the clause and concentrate the minds of trade unions and employers, the process of appraisal will normally involve negotiation at the individual level. We may specify the staff development context that is appropriate in guidance to authorities. That will be the time to do so—not in primary legislation before we have any feedback from the comments and the piloting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the amendment draws on the response of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to the clause, which sensibly recognises that a review and appraisal scheme that results in a constructive analysis of needs should exist. The Scottish Secondary' Teachers Association has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1382</span>
prepared its own report on staff development and appraisal and supports the purpose of improving the education service by providing a structured method of review and support for the development of teachers. The Professional Association of Teachers and the two head teachers' associations in Scotland are also strong proponents of appraisal. Once again, only the Educational Institute of Scotland is dragging its feet in that progressive move forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle pointed out, it is used widely in the public and private sectors as a sensible means of identifying individuals of potential and to ensure sensitive training programmes with the aim of improving the quality of products or services. Parents in Scotland have a right to expect that the performance of all teachers is monitored so that professional support can be provided, where needed. Many parents will have experience of appraisal in their own jobs and must be surprised that it has been absent until now in such a crucial job as teaching, where children can be so stimulated by good teaching—and yet are so vulnerable to bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot ask the Committee to support the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Member for Fife, Central may be persuaded to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, we shall not withdraw the amendment and shall press it to a Division. It seeks to test the Government's commitment to staff development. The Minister has assured us that the appraisal of teachers will be part and parcel of staff development generally. If so, why cannot it be written into the Bill to assure all the participants in the process that the Government mean what they say? While we accept that most of our amendments may be technically deficient, the spirit of this amendment is significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister draws again the false distinction between the EIS and all other players in education. Most partners in education are committed to the SJNC decision of January 1987 and the subsequent circular, SE/40, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The parties to the agreement will co-operate in pilot studies on the introduction and evaluation of staff development and career review schemes, with consultation with appropriate bodies in the in-service training field, with a view to the development of agreed principles which should be common to the schemes of all Education Authorities."</p></blockquote>
The discussion paper issued recently by the Scottish Education Department has a closing date of 30 June and the Minister is committed to a major seminar on the results of that consultation later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in Scotland is dragging his feet over teacher appraisal, but the issue hinges on the Government's motives in wishing to take out teacher appraisal from the complex and lengthy process of implementing a proper programme of staff development throughout Scotland. That is the serious issue that prompted the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 281, in page 43, line 48, after 'regulations', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'consult with appropriate staff unions and'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 282, in page 44, line 12, leave out 'consult' and insert, 'shall reach agreement with'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be brief because the amendments are simple and straightforward. Amendment No. 281 would involve staff unions in the drawing up of an appraisal scheme prior to its submission to the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 282 would require that agreement is reached with the staff unions and the education authority prior to implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that appraisal programmes are fair and workable and that confrontation is avoided when programmes are drawn up. They go a long way towards allaying the fears of many staff members in schools and colleges in Scotland. The staff unions have a major input on issues such as conditions and salaries of teaching staff. It is logical that they should also be involved in the appraisal process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his response to amendment No. 208, the Minister said that he was not conscious of regional authorities already having developed appraisal programmes. I refer him to the staff development programme in Dumfries and Galloway, which includes performance assessment and self-evaluation. Agreements were reached after substantial negotiations and discussion. Perhaps that example could be followed nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A sound professional base should be established if appraisal schemes for staff are to be effective and accepted. Staff development programmes should take account of curriculum changes and new demands on teachers. Professionals must be involved in the evaluation and staff unions can provide that professional approach. I am concerned about the Minister's suggestion that regional authorities should be given specifications for appraisal programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement proposed in amendment No. 282 is different from mere discussion and consultation. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments in the spirit in which they are proposed, so as to ensure that staff unions and representatives in Scotland are fully involved in drawing up appraisal programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was trying to remember whether her reference to Dumfries and Galloway was correct. She is right that it has a staff development programme. It was originally called "SOIDA", which stood for "Staff, Curricular and Institutional Development and Appraisal". After objections from the unions, it became "SOID" because the word "appraisal" aroused so much feeling that it had to be dropped.

I shall deal now with the amendments because you will become agitated, Mr. Hogg, if I do not keep in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are perverse. They would oblige education authorities merely to consult the unions over their local schemes of appraisals, whereas the Secretary of State would have to reach agreement with them over national regulations of a less detailed nature. I have no objections to the thrust of amendment No. 281. Essentially it would give statutory effect to something which we always envisaged as occurring in the normal course of events, whereby education authorities discuss with the teaching unions new proposals that affect their members. It also corresponds to the Secretary of State's obligation under subsection (5) to consult, among others, the teaching unions on any proposed regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if consultation over appraisal schemes is to be meaningful and equitable, it must involve all teaching unions with members who would be affected. It is regrettable that a number of authorities

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. It is an observation on who heard the remark allegedly made by a member of the Committee from a sedentary position. Care should be exercised, because remarks made by an hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Professional Assocation of Teachers is important. Amendment No. 281 is about obliging education authorities to consult trade unions. Some authorities find it difficult to see beyond the EIS. They seem prejudiced against the PAT, probably because it puts the interests of children first by refusing to take strike action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a disgraceful slight on every other teaching union in Scotland. Will the Minister reflect before he make such malicious criticisms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I said that the PAT put the interests of children first by refusing to take industrial action. That is a reasonable point. The EIS organised a day of action disrupting schools in Scotland last year, over our policy on school boards, but decided in November that it supported school boards and announced it to an unsuspecting world on boxing day. Disruption damages children, and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1386</span>
PAT is to be commended as the only union that refuses to have anything to do with disruption in the classroom. Education authorities are prejudiced against PAT because, like Opposition Members, they put the interests of the trade unions before the interests of the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may reflect that the EIS is not always so bad. Recently the EIS general secretary issued a press release admitting what the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has never admitted, that several schools will opt out. My hon. Friend may recall that press release.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and the general secretary has also said that education authorities will have to become more sensitive to the wishes of parents, even if what they want seems perverse when seen from regional headquarters or from the education committee. The EIS is to be commended on its realism. It now advertises on television, telling people that it is concerned about children as individuals. So we may have won another victory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend put on the record that, when he said that the PAT was against industrial disruption, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) laughed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is reducing our deliberations to absurdity. If hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to place on record the effective way in which you preside over our deliberations to ensure that we do not degenerate into absurdity, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) wanted to intervene on the question of the PAT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister invites me to do so, I have already said that I would rather make my point in my speech later, rather than in a brief intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the hon. Lady did not take the opportunity to withdraw what she said from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most concerned that all unions should play their proper part in local discussions and consultations about the introduction of appraisal and not just a favoured few. The number of PAT representations on the teachers' side of the national negotiating machinery was recently increased with my consent from one to two, to reflect its rising membership—I do not know what the hon. Member for Maryhill finds so amusing—but the PAT continues to be ignored by some authorities. It seems indefensible that more than 3,000 teachers in the PAT should be denied a direct voice in local discussions about their conditions of service so far as appraisal is concerned I will, therefore, consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1387</span>
the case for a similar amendment to amendment No. 281 on Report, except that I would seek to secure equal consultation with all the associations representing the teaching staff covered by the appraisal schemes. The hon. Member for Moray has performed a service to the PAT and I am sure that it will recognise that in the same way as it has recognised some of the other points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outcome of amendment No. 282 would be the negation of the clause and the creation of an impasse on our efforts to introduce effective appraisal. That is precisely why the hon. Lady tabled it. Conservative Members are the only ones committed to effective appraisal. Let me remind the Committee of the purpose of the clause, which is to ensure the introduction of national appraisal arrangements that are systematic, comprehensive and effective and that will raise the quality of "teaching and learning in Scottish education. If that can be achieved voluntarily by education authorities and other employers in line with guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State, the powers accorded to the Secretary of State by the clause will not have to be invoked. However, should education employers fail to agree to produce appraisal schemes compatible with the guidance, the Secretary of State is likely to use his powers to lay regulations so that the many potential benefits of effective appraisal can be obtained across the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Member for Moray to withdraw the amendment on the basis that, on Report, I shall table a wider and more effective amendment than amendment No. 281. Amendment No. 282 is neither desirable nor necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is strange that the Minister should use blandishments at the end of his speech. Perhaps that is an apology for the splenetic outburst in his earlier remarks. It is also strange that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) complained that he could not hear what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said. He and the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) talked all the time when I spoke to the amendments and they probably do not have a clue what the effect of them is. It is cheeky of them to try to make political points when they did not observe the common courtesy of listening to hon. Members trying to deal seriously with issues that effect teachers and children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My intention was that all staff unions should be involved. The Minister wants the PAT to be involved, but not the other unions. I wish that he would adopt a more courteous approach to the teaching unions because it is unfair of him to suggest that unions, such as the Educational Institute of Scotland, are not concerned about children. The unions have to be involved in all negotiations with the education authorities, and not just those on appraisal. The unions discuss curriculum changes, new education programmes, new examinations and new forms of assessment. The staff unions have a right to be involved and they are involved because,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1388</span>
in the implementation of new proposals, we have to ensure that the children benefit and do not suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must not misrepresent my remarks. I clearly said that I thought that all the unions should be consulted and I repudiated the education authorities that refused to recognise the PAT. I undertook to table an amendment to ensure that all the unions were consulted. Does the hon. Lady agree that it is wrong for education authorities to refuse to recognise the PAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that all the unions should be recognised. Unfortunately, the Government are not happy about trade unions, as we have seen in some of their other Bills. The Government are happy to do down the rights of trade unions. I have no objection to all unions being consulted at each stage of new developments in education. The Minister is now trying to back away from the antagonistic comments that he made about the Scottish teaching unions. It is not good enough to say that he wishes to involve everyone. He cannot with one breath state that some unions have no desire to do anything other than disrupt education and then hold up others as good examples of trade union practice. The unions should be treated equally and given the respect that they are due.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston (Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the thrust of what I am saying. The staff unions are very much involved in the interests of children. I speak with the authority of having been a member of a staff union for some time and an executive member in the Minister's constituency, before my election as a Member of Parliament in 1974. All our meetings were dominated by the interests of children and how best we could assist them in their education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall withdraw amendment No. 281, but that does not mean that I shall necessarily support the Minister's proposals on Report. I shall await with interest the Minister's exact recommendations. The Minister said that amendment No. 282 tries to negate the effects of the clause, but it would ensure that agreement is reached before the implementation of a system of appraisal. It is better to have the negotiations beforehand. If the Minister is prepared to lay down regulations without full consultation with the staff unions, he will create problems for education in Scotland and may be found guilty of disruption.

a more charitable mood than he is normally. Apart from the little medical problem in his constituency at the weekend, he should be buoyed up by some of the comments at the Conservative party conference, many of which are relevant to our discussion this morning. I was intrigued by the 14-year-old young lady who performed at that conference. Some people suggested, rather damagingly, that she may be another Margaret Thatcher, but other more complimentary remarks were made about her comments on Scottish education. She was quoted as saying either that Scottish education is the finest in the world, or that it is the very best, which suggests that the Minister and his supporters have been trying to undermine that over the past few weeks. The Minister may have had other weighty matters on his mind, such as the letter from Ronald Bell, the training officer at Conservative Central Office, about recruiting cadet agents in Scottish schools. Those are side issues, but I am sure that the Minister will consider them over the next two or three days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the quality of teaching in Scotland dominates this debate. Apart from the Prime Minister begging Scots to stay in the Union, the other important facet of the Tory party conference was the excellent contribution of the Secretary of State for Scotland. He proved himself a master of understatement when he said that he did not think that the Conservatives had been too sensitive to Scottish public opinion. Education is a crucial sector in which the Government have been in no way sensitive to public opinion. This morning I was hopeful that, after the Tory party conference, the Minister would have suggested that, on reflection, he was withdrawing the Bill to allow there to be the proper consultation on it that there has never been. I am naive at times and idealistic, and my aspirations have little prospect of coming true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>[MR. BILL WALKER</div> <!-- member -->	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>Teachers are at the heart of this debate. We are worried about the confusion that will arise. While we acknowledge teacher and staff appraisal, the crucial distinction is between what the Opposition want regarding staff development and what the Government want in identifying and isolating staff appraisal outwith a much wider programme of staff enhancement and career development. That is the focus of the stand part debate. Nobody argues that teachers should be allowed to perform however they see fit, without some one being able to help, advise, criticise and suggest improvements to their methods of approach and to their basic interest in education, per se. However, by the time that teachers enter the profession, they have already undergone a rigorous process. They have had teacher training, they have registered with the General Teaching Council and, in Scotland, there is the SJNC, which provides proper terms and conditions for work. Furthermore, we do not have licensed teachers. So, at the start of the process of teacher recruitment, there is a quality input. That should not be forgotten, because staff appraisal seeks to build upon teachers' skills and commitment.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that there are no bad teachers in Scottish schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that inane comment is hardly worth a response. The EIS has been knocked about this morning and now I am asked whether there are any bad teachers in Scotland. I may as well ask whether there are any bad doctors. Perhaps there are in Central region—the Minister is now hard on the heels of one. I shall deal with the point later in a more sensitive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that, because we have the GTC and teacher training, teachers reach a certain standard on which we should build. I asked whether he thought that there were any bad teachers in Scottish schools, and he refused to answer, but parents are entitled to know that if there are bad teachers they will be identified. Why is the hon. Gentleman hedging? Will he acknowledge that there are bad teachers, just as there are bad politicians, doctors or bad performers in every job? Appraisal identifies those who are not performing to a certain standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an extraordinary meal of that intervention. Of course, there are good and bad proponents of every profession in every walk of life. We should not discuss staff appraisal, even in the Government sense, if we did not assume that teachers have different skills, commitments and qualities. The Minister made an extremely daft comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before teachers take up their first post, they go through a rigorous process to ensure that, at the base point, they are qualified and trained and, I hope, have a basic commitment to the school. We are dealing with what happens after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman's argument is that teacher training and GTC registration is a sufficiently rigorous process, how do bad teachers get into the system? The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is getting prematurely excited.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the first process in recruiting teachers. The Minister asked how bad teachers got into schools. The answer revolves around the definition of what the Minister calls "bad". The Government see everything in black and white. In any walk of life, some people are excellent at their jobs and some are not so good. Some might be better in another profession with a sharper appreciation of what they are doing, and improvement of their skills. That is why we are concerned about page 5 of the consultation paper, which mentions the appraisal of teachers' performance. We are not opposed to the appraisal of teachers but it must be carried out in the proper context of staff development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The hon. Gentleman has admitted that there are bad teachers in Scottish schools and that some who are not up to the job might be better off in another profession. Does he think that appraisal should be used to identify such people so that they can be transferred into another profession? That seems to be what he is saying under the cover of staff development. If that is what he is saying, it would be useful if he would spell it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I am saying. The Minister likes to take comments, wrap them in his own thinking and serve them back to the person who made them. We have discussed bad teachers and suggested that in Scotland there are people who are good and bad at their jobs in every profession. That is not news; it is self-evident and part of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a profession in which individuals have to face-to-face contact with children five days a week for most weeks of the year. It also produces an interesting relationship between the parent and the teacher and between the parent, child and teacher. If the system of teacher appraisal is linked to staff development, it could identify those who—to use the Minister's words—are not up to the task, those who, with better training, could be improved, those who could be moved to another subject or those who should perhaps leave the profession altogether. Those are four options that could arise in a system of staff appraisal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a witch hunt clause designed merely to look for bad teachers. The Minister must define what he means by a bad teacher, which is a sensitive topic. In Fife there is continual appraisal of teachers, some of it self-appraisal and some done by the authority in deciding on promotion. The authority is always on the lookout for teachers who might not meet its expectations. I am sure that the Minister appreciates the realities of Scottish education. As a parent, one quickly finds out about the quality of education from one's son or daughter, which is also a useful input into the authority directorate or, through the head teacher, to the teacher involved. The process of teacher appraisal already exists although it might not be as formal as the Minister wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made considerable progress. The hon. Gentleman has admitted that he is in favour
	<span class='label label-info column'>1392</span>
of teacher appraisal, and that there are good and bad teachers. If I heard him rightly, that could result in them being moved to another subject or moved from the profession altogether. Can we finally agree where we stand on the rigorous examination to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) referred? At the end of the day, appraisal must result not merely in more resources being given to a teacher, but in awards being given or discipline being imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is the market theory that there are winners or losers, rewards or punishment. Scottish education is not permeated with that loose and woolly ideological thinking; it is about sensitivity and the quality of teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made no case for the type of teacher appraisal envisaged in clause 64 and the consultative document. It is normal practice for a problem to be identified, analysed and tackled through negotiated options. I should like the Minister to say what is wrong with Scottish teaching and on what basis he can evaluate what needs to be done. Advice notes might come from the top table, but we want to know what is so wrong with Scottish education that teaching unions, staff associations and local authorities cannot be left to develop their own systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

An analysis of what he has just said will make it clear that that is his position. Is he worried that the EIS will come down on him? Why is he afraid to acknowledge that there is widespread support for a system of appraisal that will ensure that good teachers are rewarded and promoted, strength and weaknesses are identified and that people not suited to the profession are moved elsewhere to find their potential? That is what the hon. Gentleman said, so why is it so difficult for him to admit it in response to my hon. Friend's intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Opposition do not agree with the proposals contained in clause 64, as set out in page 5 and beyond of the consultative document. The reason is simple.

It is far too simplistic for him constantly to refer to the vested interests of the EIS as if it were not interested in teachers or children. We doubt the Government's commitment to sensible teacher appraisal that would take cognisance of the wider developmental aspects of teachers and the education of children generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fife regional council prepared a document in which it makes the distinction between a highly centralised form of appraisal and what is now happening in progressive authorities based on the SE/40 circular, the SJNC discussions after the dispute, pilot projects and what good practice has shown throughout Scotland. This paper is a report for the meeting, on Monday 10 April 1989, of the school sub-committee of Fife regional council's education committee. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It must first be recognised that teachers, like any other employed person, are appraised at many different times throughout their career. Pupils, parents, headteachers, advisers and other teachers all have views on individual abilities. In such ways are staff considered for promotion and on lesser occasions for reprimand.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>What is being proposed in the paper"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the paper prepared by the Scottish Office in February 1989—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is formal appraisal. In both the primary, secondary and special sectors in Fife at the present time there are currently projects underway in line with the agreement contained within SJNC Circular SE/40. It would be premature to anticipate in detail the likely findings of the projects but some main points could be made at this time."</p></blockquote>
The following are points that I should like the Minister to answer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"—the primary purpose of staff appraisal is to contribute to the professional development of teachers.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal is a major commitment on the part of the employer. Where the needs of an individual teacher are identified then there is an implicit agreement to provide the resources to meet that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1394</span>
need. These could take the form of release for staff development or increased support or additional class materials, among others.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal takes time. A teacher being appraised is not teaching nor is a headteacher or principal teacher or whoever is conducting the appraisal. Where in the working week of teachers can time be found for this activity is difficult to identify, but in terms of SE/40, unless Planned Activity Time or In-Service Time is used, it can only be by release from teaching duties.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal requires considerable training of and the development of interpersonal skills by the person conducting the interview.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal is a two way process. A teacher does not work in isolation and in any appraisal the role of the management staff, the authority through its advisory service etc must also come under scrutiny.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal must be according to an agreed agenda where both parties agree to the matters under consideration.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal must be undertaken against a background where the person being appraised is aware of the indicators being used against which their performance is being judged. In an ideal system the teacher should already have been working to the indicators for some time prior to the interview.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—appraisal is wide in format. It covers institutional appraisal, management appraisal, individual teacher appraisal, curricular audit, resource assessment and self appraisal which in many instances is the most critical of all."</p></blockquote>
That is a resume of eloquent common sense on staff appraisal. Is that the same common sense that the Minister wishes to be enforced by regulation on Scottish education? If that approach were accepted, regulations might not need to be enforced in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's view differs from that of the Government because we support that teacher-centred approach to appraisal. It concentrates on the qualities of teachers and their contribution to education. We are not interested in black and white distinctions, whether about punishment or reward, or about good or bad teachers. Scottish education is far too complex to have simplistic and often ideological notions knocked about as if every one agreed with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have often talked about partnership in education. Indeed, the contribution of the Secretary of State for Scotland at the Conservative party conference was about Tories being sensitive to Scottish needs and what they intend to do about it. Partnership is the key to the Government making inroads into Scotland's political culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The entire Bill is about taking local powers and centralising them in the Scottish Office. Clause 64 brings out the stick again because it is claimed that education authorities have been dragging their feet and that the EIS is to blame for all the ills of Scottish education so partnership is not necessary. Instead, the Government are content to give education authorities until the end of this year, or perhaps later, but if they do not deliver what the Government want, the stick will come out and, like testing, teacher appraisal will be hurried through, often on the flimsiest of evidence, to satisfy a political whim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to reject that view of Scottish education. Let us have a partnership and see what results from consultation. Let us wait for the results of pilot schemes and make sure that if we go ahead in such a sensitive sector, there is a powerful agreement between the education partners. That will be in the interests of teachers and, in the longer term, the interests of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put that into context, there are about 50,000 teachers in Scotland, so it is a safe bet that some will not have chosen the best profession for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the few methods of getting rid of staff that the headmaster does not want is by giving a bad teacher a good report so that that teacher can gain promotion away from the school. Sometimes, chickens come home to roost and the bad teacher who received a good report applies for another promotion in his original school. The head teacher's reaction is to say, "But I do not want him back."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not a human weakness rather than a weakness in the teaching profession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a weakness in the present structure of assessing the weaknesses and strengths of individual teachers. If a head teacher has no proper way to get rid of teachers who fall below the standard essential to run the school effectively, he has to find other ways and means. I am criticising the structure and not head teachers who have behaved in that way. We have locked them into a system in which they cannot get rid of staff. How will head teachers sort out weak teachers and promote excellent teachers without a standard means of appraisal to evaluate conduct?

I was not being frivolous when I asked whether the hon. Gentleman had considered Royal Air Force procedures. Flying is a dangerous occupation and pilots who get into difficulties may be responsible for loss of life or danger to others. In the 1950s, because of a tremendous escalation in accidents, the RAF set about tightening up procedures. It tackled the problem by setting up a team to carry out the recategorisation and re-evaluation of instructors. That system had always existed, but in the 1950s the RAF realised that it had to be brought up to date to meet the problems brought about by modern jet aircraft. The result was that the RAF Central Flying School became a school of excellence in which "trappers" acted like inspectors. All instructors were above average in flying ability and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) prompted this discussion about the Royal Air Force by his constant references to pilot schemes. However, we do not require details of the RAF scheme. I hope that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) will make a few important points so that we can progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1396</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I was illustrating, in this highly dangerous sector of teaching, that a method already existed to evaluate performance that the hon. Member for Fife, Central would at least consider. Furthermore, I hope that the EIS and other teaching unions would consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A method exists of evaluating properly, appraising annually and checking out instructors—both flying and on the ground—and of assessing the quality and standards of their pupils in ground examinations, which are complex, technical and difficult, as well as their ability to fly. It happens every year in the RAF. That scheme is run by a Government Department to appraise flying teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one likes having what they do examined in detail. It is interesting to note how Members of Parliament respond to critical comments in the media. People in every occupation are reluctant to be checked. It is better that that is done by their peers than by an enlightened—or unenlightened— journalist. I would prefer appraisal of teachers to be carried out within the organisation by highly competent, qualified teachers, to make sure that other teachers are capable of carrying out their tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never accepted that if one has initial training for a job, that training lasts for life. That is nonsense and we should not subscribe to it. The pace of change is so great today that we must all be continually retrained and reappraised in whatever occupation we follow. Because teachers are given a good, comprehensive training, it does not mean that they are capable of doing that job for the rest of their lives without further retraining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To make his contribution more balanced, will the hon. Gentleman accept that, to some extent, that already happens? Scottish education authorities already have in-service training and curricular changes. They recognise the need for adaptation and flexiblity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that some of that goes on, but I do not believe that there is enough, or that sufficiently in-depth appraisals are made, or that that is in the best interests of good teachers. It is a tragedy that we cannot discover who the good teachers are and reward them accordingly. In every other profession, if one excels, one receives tangible rewards. That can only be done by a form of constructive appraisal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's argument relies on the example of the RAF. Is it not the case that assessment in the RAF was so strict that the hon. Gentleman was asked to move on, and he now finds himself a Member of Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should spend a little more time studying my career. If he did that, he would realise that I am still a squadron leader in the RAF. It asked me to remain: I did not ask to stay on. I am responding to a personal attack, Mr Hogg, but if the hon. Gentleman had considered the matter in some depth, he would have understood that I had responsibility for training for some years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a medal that proves that at least I did something. Whatever one might frivolously think about the matter, parents are worried about the value and quality of education and I am concerned about good teachers, of whom there are many. Such teachers have told me that, no matter how good they are, they are not recognised and that teachers who do not pull their weight are not shown up under the present system. That is why the clause is so important. As a result of its provisions, good teachers will be recognised and encouraged, and those who are not so good will be given an incentive to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only against measurement, evaluations and appraisals that individuals can see that they are falling below par and that they must do something about it. We saw a marked difference in the performance of Labour Members when the Labour party devised a system of reselection. I do not wish to comment upon the quality of that, but it was a form of appraisal and it had a dramatic effect on some Opposition Members in the past two Parliaments. Those who did not measure up vanished because, under the system of reselection, it was possible to remove them. The Labour party subscribes to a system of appraisals for its Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not wish to comment on the weakness and failure of the Labour party's system and how it evaluated you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows why there is all the more reason that we should have appraisal and evaluation for teachers. The system has a weakness if there are no methods of regular appraisal against standards that are accepted and laid down. One cannot discover who is weak, good, or should not be doing the job. Some of those who are weak can be assisted to do their job more effectively if that weakness is highlighted. The earlier such weakness is highlighted, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that someone can be very good at one stage, perhaps immediately after training, but that one's performance graph may go down later because of the factors that impinge on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1398</span>
teachers, such as repetition and classroom contact hours. Teachers may be unaware that they are way below par. That is why the clause is so important. Anyone who cares deeply about Scottish education should welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your indulgence, Mr. Hogg, I want to put on record that I did say, "Good", when the Minister observed that no Scottish local authority recognises the Professional Association of Teachers. Rather than facing up to trade unions, any management, particularly in commerce and business, prefers to encourage a union that will not do its task for its members. They prefer what have been termed in America, "sweeheart unions". It does local authorities credit that they will not recognise such unions and want to negotiate with real trade unions. I am happy to place that on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady confirm that she supports only those trade unions that go on strike?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I was about to describe my thoughts about unions such as the PAT. People who are unwilling to stand up for their rights do not have sufficient respect for themselves and are not fit to be recognised by the relevant education authorities. If they do not have that respect for themselves, why should managements and pupils respect them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thoughts of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) jumped automatically to the issue of going on strike. For many years, trade unions have attempted to negotiate reasonable deals that both sides can accept without necessarily having to resort to strike action. The history of most of the real teaching unions has followed that pattern. However, they must be prepared to take such action when necessary, and I respect the real trade unions for having done exactly that. Obviously, I do not respect those who will never take such action irrespective of the provocation or the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to correct the hon. Lady, who reported me as saying that all local authorities do not recognise the PAT. That is not correct. The authorities of Central and Lothian regions do not recognise the PAT. Strathclyde has a separate arrangement for consulting the PAT. In view of what she has said, does the hon. Lady condemn the practice of Grampian, Borders, Highland, Fife, Tayside and Strathclyde, which recognise the PAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That gave the Minister the opportunity to correct the information that he gave earlier to the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what the Minister said. The record will show what he said earlier.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that I wish that such a teacher had sufficient self-respect to join a real trade union and not try some type of cop out, which is what that is. The PAT represents a tiny number of people, nothing like the numbers represented by other teaching unions in Scotland. The Minister is keen to promote the PAT. He said that its involvement in negotiations had increased recently, with his consent. That comment amused me. What he really meant was that he had done his best to promote the interests of the PAT at the expense of the real teaching unions. He has seized every opportunity to encourage schools to fill vacancies with a member of the PAT instead of a member of a union such as the EIS, which represents the vast majority of teachers in Scotland. No one should be surprised that the Minister prefers a sweetheart union. I am surprised that he is surprised that we think otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, will the hon. Lady confirm that she repudiates and condemns the policy of Strathclyde regional council on recognition of the PAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said what I think about that and I shall not waste time repeating it. If the hon. Gentleman was not listening because he was talking to the bad boys at the back of the class, that is too bad. I shall not say it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that about 3,000 members of the PAT were refused recognition. The PAT has about 5,000 members. Is the hon. Lady really saying that those 5,000 teachers in Scotland who have joined the PAT are letting down the teaching profession and showing children a poor example? That is what I took her to say. On reflection, I cannot believe that she does not want to withdraw remarks that will cause grave offence to those 5,000 teachers who have chosen to join a non-striking union because they believe that the interests of children are damaged by disruption in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister listens to that view with incredulity. He must spend far too much time talking to fellow Conservatives and not to people with other opinions because my view is not unique. It is widespread in Scottish society, including my constituency. Why is the Minister so surprised that I believe that people who join any union that is covenanted to never taking strike action are seriously mistaken about where their true interests lie? I would strongly urge them to join a real trade union. I do not want to hurt their feelings but they are profoundly mistaken in their view of not only their interests but those of the children whom they are defending. They argue that it is they who are truly interested in children's rights because under no circumstances would they ever take industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that tens of thousands of teachers in real trade unions are not interested in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1400</span>
children's welfare? That would be the obverse argument. He is nodding. He reacted to my statements with incredulity, and I react to his with equal incredulity. He is telling us that the vast majority of teachers in Scotland are not interested in children's rights because they belong to a union that will call them out to take action once in a while when all other ways of resolving a conflict have failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is misrepresenting my remarks. I was interested in her suggestion that children in schools could not be expected to respect teachers who join the PAT and were not prepared to go on strike. I am sure that she did not mean to say that pupils would respect only teachers who were prepared to take industrial action. Perhaps she would like to withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister reads the record, he will find that I said that if teachers have insufficient respect for themselves to join a real trade union, they cannot expect others to respect them sufficiently to give them the authority that they deserve. The Tory hard Right-wingers from England find that incredible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point of view is widely held in the sectors of society that the Government are trying to crush. They are not crushable and will continue to struggle for their trade union rights despite the actions of Conservative Members. My view that most pupils are unlikely to respect teachers who join the PAT is based on my observations of life in the west of Scotland. Many pupils would have more respect for a teacher who was in a real trade union and not someone who was so anxious—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his crowd are anxious to have a knockabout debate about the status of the PAT instead of dealing with the meat of the clause. They are afraid of trade union involvement. They do not want to face up to a trade union that promotes effectively the interests of its members. They have consistently talked about appraisal in terms of praise or punishment. Has it not crossed their minds that few teachers are deliberately bad teachers? They are not trying to be bad teachers. We are not talking about disciplinary action. If someone has committed a disciplinary offence there are structures to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions should be involved in effective systems of appraisal and consequent attempts to improve a teacher's performance, as that is necessary to ensure a fair appraisal. Without trade union involvement from the start, how will people know that the appraisal system is fair, will be conducted properly and take account of relevant factors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Conservative Member said that good teachers were not being promoted, but in the world at large, people are promoted not only because they are good at their jobs but because they have ingratiated themselves with the management. That happens in all walks of life. By getting well in with management, people are promoted into jobs that are beyond their capabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to protect bad teachers who deliberately skive or try to get away with doing a bad job. If they cannot or will not improve, such teachers should be sacked. We want to help teachers overcome genuine problems and to ensure that those problems are put at the right door. People should not be made scapegoats for the inadequacies of others. Trade unions are interested not in calling out their members on strike every five minutes—as in the heated imaginations of some Conservative Members—but in defending the rights of teachers and pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that Conservative Members seem to think that teachers are afraid of that. Effective teachers do not want to carry passengers. When a class is disorderly in one period, that creates problems for the teachers taking that class for the following period. Nobody wants a disorderly school that is in a state of constant disruption. It is in everyone's interests to achieve the best performance from teachers and to ensure that peoper remedies are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers will be afraid of admitting faults if, as a result, they may be heaved out on to the street with no job to go to. If they had confidence in a decent system that would give them a fair appraisal and help them to improve, they would be more willing to commit themselves to that. That is why we argue for proper trade union involvement. Such a system could be run more effectively with the involvement of real trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 64 is important and the Committee will agree with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) on that. The hon. Lady's speech has considerable importance and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1402</span>
should be widely publicised. She did not necessarily give the official Labour party policy—perhaps the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) can confirm whether her speech reflects official Labour party policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that her views were widely shared. Presumably, she meant by Opposition Members on the Committee—that is the only reasonable interpretation. My hon. Friend the Minister believes that consultation on appraisal and other matters should take place with all the education trade unions and associations. The hon. Member for Maryhill believes that if a trade union or association gives up the right to strike, because it believes that that is in the best interests of pupils, it should be excluded automatically from consultation and recognition. Numbers are not involved. The PAT is not the smallest teacher union or association in Scotland. The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers has fewer members, although there is probably not much difference between it and the PAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady put forward the principle, in relation to consultation on appraisal, that teachers who give up their right to strike are to be excluded from recognition, consultation and involvement and to be derided and laughed at, as they were laughed at this morning by Labour Members. Members of Parliament will tell pupils that if their teachers give up the right to strike, they should not respect them. That is precisely what the hon. Lady was saying.

I support this important clause. The debate is important, not just for teacher appraisal, but for what it has revealed about the real, true, genuine voice of the Labour movement in Scotland. That was shown in the speech made by the hon. Member for Maryhill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. John McFall. No, Mr. John McAllion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would be very upset in Dundee if you, Mr. Hogg, called me John McFall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those reading the debate should not pay any attention to what has been said by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). He continually misrepresents what is said by Opposition Members and he should not be taken seriously. He continually tries to score petty party political points at the expense of others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here he goes again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way with his customary kindness and courtesy. How did my remarks misrepresent the position of the hon. Member for Maryhill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) clearly expressed her distaste for the policies of the Professional Association of Teachers. That distaste is shared by many other teachers and by

Many people in Scotland. However, she did not suggest that people should not be able to join the association of their own free will. That suggestion came from Conservative Members, and the 3,000 members of the PAT will be surprised by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the much more important contribution to the debate, which was made by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). At the weekend, the Minister criticised Tories for not blowing their own trumpet. That allegation cannot be made against the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Indeed, this morning he gave a virtuoso performance, describing his experience in the RAF and how that applied to clause 64.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I returned to London yesterday, I found that a leaflet had come through the letterbox. I thought that the hon. Member for Tayside, North had been around Stockwell. The leaflet states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So, what would</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>YOU</i></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>call a politician who …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>knows what it's like to be</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>unemployed</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>worked on a Government</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Community Programme</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>served with the Royal Marines</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>on the streets of Belfast</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>worked in the Aerospace Industry</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>has been a diplomat with the</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>United Nations in Geneva".</p></blockquote>
I opened up the leaflet and expected to see the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Unfortunately, inside was somebody called Paddy Ashdown, whom I have not come across in my two years in the House. However, for a moment, I believed that the hon. Member for Tayside, North had been canvassing in Stockwell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the amendments that we discussed earlier, two things struck me. The first was on the issue of staff development and it seemed that the Minister and the rest of the Committee agreed that it was a good thing. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), the Minister said that he would ensure that any regulations brought forward would require the wider staff development concept to be made clear. Therefore, it perplexed me that the Minister objected to amendment No. 208, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schemes for the appraisal of teaching staff must be part of a coherent and negotiated programme of staff development."</p></blockquote>
Then it struck me that it was the word "negotiated" to which the Minister objected. He does not mind staff development as long as it does not have to be agreed with education authorities or the staff unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the same with amendment No. 282, tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). It asked the Secretary of State to "agree" with the staff unions. Again, the Minister objected. He does not mind telling people what he proposes to do and he even allows them to write in with their comments. However, do not try to tie the Minister down to agreeing with people on how the problem should be solved. He does not want agreement: he wishes to impose everything through the Secretary of State for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1404</span>
Scotland. That is why the clause should not stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to avoid the strife that we have seen in Scottish schools for many years, we must move from the attitude by which the Tory Secretary of State for Scotland can impose on Scottish schools any scheme that he wishes. Tory Secretaries of State do not speak for the Scottish people, they do not reflect the Scottish experience and they are bitterly resented. Such an attempt at imposition on Scottish schools will lead to further unrest, unhappiness and disruption of education. The Minister's response to our amendments is another reason why the clause should not stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 281 requires education authorities to
	<br><blockquote><p>"consult with appropriate staff unions".</p></blockquote>
The Minister seemed to be in favour of that, but was concerned that the Professional Association of Teachers would not be included in that consultation because, he alleged, education authorities did not recognise the PAT. Later he explained that only two authorities did not recognise that body. How far does that failure by those two authorities to recognise the PAT go? Is the PAT recognised for the purpose of representation on the education committee, or is it total non-recognition, whereby teachers employed by those authorities cannot belong to that union? That is an important distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS is rightly concerned that unions such as the PAT are growing in Scotland, because they undermine the teachers' position when it comes to bargaining with education authorities or with the Government. So the EIS and other official trade unions are anxious to minimise the PAT's growth. At one time the EIS said that if the PAT were represented on the Tayside education authority committee, the EIS would withdraw. Any responsible education authority would rather have the main teachers' unions represented on the committee than a small organisation such as the PAT, which does not represent a significant number of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objection to the PAT is fundamental. It does not come from the employers; most employers are delighted to recognise the PAT. If the education authority makes an offer and the PAT does not agree, the authority simply ignores it because it knows that the PAT will do nothing about it. The PAT is the bosses' dream; if the bosses do not listen to the PAT, it says, "OK, don't listen to us." The Tory party would like every union to be like that, but they are not, as we witnessed yesterday in London and shall witness throughout the summer. I shall be interested to discover whether the nod from the Minister means that he agrees that the unions should be militant in taking on the Government and the employers and in causing disruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the wording of clause 64 suggests that there will be consultation, pilot schemes and an agreed programme for the appraisal and development of teachers, the spirit behind the clause was shown when the Minister deliberately wrecked amendments that required the Secretary of State to agree a package with those involved. The Minister has no intention of reaching any agreement; he intends to impose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1405</span>
whatever scheme he favours on education authorities, teachers' unions and Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier intervention, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said that he wanted to avoid woolly thinking. He went on to say that he objected to a system of appraisal if it simply resulted in more resources being allocated for teachers whose performances fell short of the required standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make my view clear. I said, or intended to say, that we could not have a system of appraisal in which the only outcome was more resources being allocated to the individual. In many circumstances that may be what is needed, but I was trying to tease out of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) an admission that sometimes the allocation of additional resources will not solve the problem and further sanctions may be needed. I was surprised that the hon. Member for Fife, Central seemed to accept so much of my argument, but was not prepared to take the final step and admit that that must be the inevitable result of appraisal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now developing what he said, but earlier he did not accept that the outcome of any appraisal scheme should be the simple allocation of more resources to improve the unsatisfactory performance of teachers: he said that appraisals were to reward or to discipline teachers. I cannot remember exactly what the Minister said, but he agreed with the hon. Gentleman. But that is not the point of introducing appraisal schemes into schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 5 of the consultation paper issued in February 1989 contains a section on the appraisal of teachers' performances. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To be effective and comprehensive, programmes for professional development of staff must start from an accurate identification of the training needs of teachers. … This requires assessment or appraisal of the performance of individual teachers."</p></blockquote>
It says that a sound appraisal scheme would
	<br><blockquote><p>"devise appropriate programmes of support".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In other professions and occupations appraisal is a recognised management tool; in the education service its use should raise the quality of delivery … by making possible well focused professional development and support".</p></blockquote>
That seems to say the opposite of what the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said this morning. The consultation paper says that the purpose of appraisal is to find means to support teachers, but the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle denies that. He says that its purpose is to weed out those teachers who can be sacked. The hon. Gentleman calls that discipline, and the Minister called it something else, but it is really a means of sacking teachers in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we debate this point at some length. I wish to map out areas where the hon. Gentleman and I might agree. We might agree that nine times out of 10 agreement will be reached with the teacher who is being appraised, and that help and resources will be given to that teacher, but that in a minority of cases some other sanction will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1406</span>
As the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said that there were bad teachers as well as good teachers, does the hon. Gentleman accept that in a small minority of cases a final sanction beyond extra allocation of resources may be necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting how the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle develops the idea. It has now developed almost beyond recognition. Earlier he called for a rigorous dissection of the ideas in Committee. He said that appraisal had two main functions; reward and discipline. He later said that on some occasions we should direct more resources to individuals to help them develop as teachers. Now he has developed his case even further and says that in nine tenths of all cases extra resources will be allocated to help individuals to perform better as teachers. That is a different position from the one taken by the hon. Gentleman about an hour ago with which the Minister concurred. What is the reality? Are we talking about sacking teachers or about a proper development programme to identify teachers who want to be helped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under certain circumstances a teacher may wish to move outwith the teaching profession. People do not want to do a job that they are not good at. If people do not get job satisfaction and do not find it worthwhile going in at nine o'clock they will look for other job opportunities. If teachers are not doing their job properly through lack of support or proper training, staff development programmes or appraisal schemes should find out their needs and enable them to become good teachers. If teachers are willing to continue teaching, they should be able to stay on at schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that there are bad teachers everywhere. I accept, as do the hon. Member for Tayside, North and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) that there probably are, but we do not know of any. Members of the Committee should not say that they know that there are bad teachers if they only suspect that they exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman understands, I have advised local schools in my constituency about problems with teachers, one of whom had a dreadful drink problem. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to imagine that this is a witch hunt. If there had been a proper appraisal system, that teacher's problem would have been dealt with earlier and more sympathetically before it became a disaster for him and the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have personal experience of teachers with a drink problem who taught children while under the influence of drink. That is a serious problem in any business and an enlightened employer would try to deal with it in an enlightened way, for example by giving him leave and time to control the problem. The Opposition, teaching unions and local authorities do not disagree with that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with another possible flaw of an appraisal scheme, which is that it would merely make it easier to sack teachers. In the circumstances
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1407</span>
described by the hon. Member for Tayside, North everyone would wish for the best solution for the school, the pupils and the teacher himself and would not use his problem as an excuse to sack him. However, there are circumstances in which the scheme set out in clause 64 could have an adverse impact on not only the teacher but the children in his charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am currently involved in a scheme called the Industry in Parliament Trust whereby one spends 25 days with an employer. Salesmen working for that employer are set target figures. If they achieve those figures in any month they receive a reward. One reward was to attend a conference in Spain for three days so everyone strove to achieve the figures. I am worred that the appraisal scheme for teachers might involve target figures—for example, the number of passes gained in national examinations at primary levels 4 and 7, which the Minister has introduced. A secondary school teacher might have to obtain a certain number of O-grade or Higher passes. Teachers might have to perform in terms of a target rather than in the way that is best for the children. The Minister must be more forthright in explaining the criteria for an appraisal scheme for teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North mentioned a teacher who had a drink problem, but how else does one judge who is a bad teacher? The allocation of classes within a department can affect a teacher's performance. When I worked in schools, the principal teachers allocated the classes and as surely as the sun rose in the morning, they ensured that they taught the top streams and the high flyers so that they got more passes and looked good. Young teachers get the worst classes in terms of academic ability and the no-hopers who will not pass exams and will cause problems in class. On the whole, the young and unpromoted teachers deal with greater problems than the principal teachers. How will one differentiate between those teachers when appraising their performance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like an education system in great need of reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the education system that is in need of reform but the principal teachers and the power that they wield within it. The Bill will give even greater powers to those in the hierarchy in schools and will subject unpromoted teachers to even more injustice and unfairness in the way in which their daily lives are governed by decisions taken by those above them. The problem is to try to find a system of appraisal that is fair. Nothing in clause 64 convinces me that the system suggested by the Minister will be fair to teachers in all the complex circumstances in Scotland. An ideological format is being imposed, with no thought to its implications for those who will be affected by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the uncertainty surrounding technology academies and self-governing schools, the position of teachers will be increasingly vulnerable. There is a danger that this
	<span class='label label-info column'>1408</span>
so-called teacher appraisal may be used to the disadvantage of teachers and children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. An opted-out school may choose academic selection, specialise in certain areas of the curriculum and negotiate its own terms of agreement with staff. Whatever else, that is a highly political concept of a school. Those who decide on that type of school are making a political judgment about the school that they want. Many staff who are forcibly transferred into that school may not agree with that political concept. They may be in fundamental disagreement with the board of management and the head teacher and not like how the school has been turned into a particular type of school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to such teachers under the teacher appraisal scheme? Is there scope for the head teacher and the board of management to use the scheme to weed out teachers who do not agree with them? We do not know. The clause does not say, and the Minister has not told us. Nobody knows. It is not surprising that teachers' unions are up in arms about clause 64, which is part of the Bill that will fundamentally change the nature of the school in which their members work. I am not surprised that people are upset about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to be brief, because I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is anxious to contribute. The Minister said earlier that those not suited to the profession would be moved to another area where their potential could be better fulfilled. He really meant that they would be sacked. In the context of employment in Scotland today, being sacked means that one does not have another job to go to. That does not worry the Minister, but it worries the people who will be affected, those representing the staff unions, and Opposition Members. The measure gives scope for political interference and for personal vendettas by the members of the boards of management and by head teachers against individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has argued continually that the Bill will allow schools to become predominantly of one religious type, whether Catholic, Protestant or Muslim. Within that, there is scope for discrimination against staff in terms of teacher appraisal. I am not satisfied that the Bill or the Minister can assure us that the appraisal scheme will operate fairly in Scotland and, for that reason, I cannot support the clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I know that the Minister wants to sum up on the clause. I am not against appraisal if it is a good management tool for staff development and has the confidence of staff. There is no need for legislation because the matter can be overtaken by arrangement between the Department, the education authorities and the teacher organisations. Circular SE/40, which formed the basis of the settlement of the long teachers dispute, provided for the introduction of pilot studies in staff development and career review. Those have proceeded satisfactorily in most regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience drawn from 57 pilot studies will be considered at a seminar to be arranged by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1409</span>
Government before the end of 1989. The Secretary of State has said that he hopes that from that seminar will emerge an agreed basis for appraisal guidelines that will command the widespread support of the education service. Teachers are well appraised at present. They go through college—that appraisal lasts four years. They go through a probationary period, which lasts at least two years. Appraisal takes place every time a teacher applies for promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers' unions and teachers are suspicious that, after a long teachers dispute and rhetoric from Ministers abusing them, being derogatory about them, and accusing them of being responsible for all the ills of society, appraisal is just another straitjacket on them so that people with vested interests can fulfil their objectives. They regard that—perhaps rightly— as a simple instrument of control. Therefore, when he sums up, the Minister is obliged to explain that discussions and negotiations with the unions and the education authorities are necessary. Why cannot the proposal of appraisal schemes be left to the education authorities in conjunction with the Scottish Education Department? Why cannot the strengths and weaknesses of an individual teacher be investigated and a programme then worked out for that person?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to principal teachers and their role. 1 do not agree with all that he said, but I agree that—if used as a proper managerial tool—senior managers, assistant head teachers, deputies and heads should examine their departments to assess the role of probationary and other teachers. That will impress upon the principal teacher the need for good staff development within his or her department. In other words, young teachers should be given the opportunity to do the full spread of teaching, which at the moment some of them are prevented from doing. If appraisal is used properly and senior management use a system that has the confidence of the teachers, that will be a good thing for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's objectives worry teachers. Therefore, schemes have to be introduced delicately and the staff must be persuaded of their merits. There must be a voluntary commitment from the staff and that requires confidence in the management and the people presenting the scheme. The integrity of the scheme must be beyond reproach, but under clause 64 that will not be so. It is another centralised measure emanating from the Scottish Education Department with all the i's dotted and all the t's crossed and it allows no opportunity for discussion and for fashioning the scheme to suit local needs and requirements. Confidence is important if teachers are not to see the measures as instruments of control for use by vested interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would happen in a self-governing school, if a scheme is drawn up that has the imprint of the concerns and fads of some individuals on the school board? That possibility was hinted at by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East. The Minister must ensure that the scheme has integrity and that would be demonstrated by him showing us that he was open-minded about consulting each and every authority, about giving them responsibility for their
	<span class='label label-info column'>1410</span>
own actions and about seeing that staff appraisal is used positively. We do not want, as Tory Members at the back have suggested, categorisation between good and bad teachers and between reward and punishment. We want the abilities of teachers to be enhanced by staff appraisal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a big task for the Minister. In the past few years, he has taken every opportunity to knock teachers in Scotland. For once, will the Minister live up to his office and be big-minded enough to introduce a worthwhile scheme and to eliminate the pettiness and vindictiveness that has emanated from Government Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a revealing debate. The record of the proceedings will be worthy of considerable scrutiny by not just members of the Committee, but by parents and teachers in Scotland. Some revealing statements were made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). She said that she was expressing her own opinion. She is doing herself and her cause a disservice. She is the real voice of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is doing the hon. Member for Maryhill a disservice. She said clearly that her views were widely shared among her colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. When pressed, the hon. Lady said that although she was speaking for herself, her views were widely shared in Scotland. I presume that they are shared by many people in the Labour party. We heard the authentic voice of the Labour party from the hon. Lady; if a teacher dares to exercise his right to join a union other than the EIS he is held in low regard by his peers and pupils. He would not be respected as a teacher if he joined the Professional Association of Teachers because it has disavowed strike action. That is clearly, fairly and squarely on the record and is worthy of closer scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appalling for the hon. Lady to suggest that more than 3,000 teachers—the Minister said it was 5,000—who choose a union to represent their views on clause 64, the Bill or on Scottish education should not have rights of recognistion and should have those rights only if they are prepared to belong to the trade union that she prescribes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PLACING OF RECORDED CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS IN SCHOOLS OUTWITH SCOTLAND ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 44, line 25, at beginning insert "—(1)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also discuss Government amendment No. 317.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are designed to offer the widest possible choice to parents of handicapped children. We are all aware—the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) has taken a particular interest in this—that much excellent work is done with such children in Scottish schools. The range of handicaps is wide and the needs of individual children vary enormously, and it is by no means unusual for parents or for education authorities to conclude that a child's particular needs could best be met by attending a school or institution outwith Scotland. The Bill already recognises that fact, and clause 65 removes any doubt that Scottish children with special needs can be placed at schools in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have concluded that the clause as drafted does not go far enough. I believe that parents of handicapped children should be able to select the type of education that they regard as being best for their children, even if that means attending a school or institution abroad. For example, we are all aware of the reputation of the Peto Institute in Budapest. I visited the institute earlier this year, and was struck by the dedication and determination of Scottish parents whom I met there. Some of them have made immense sacrifices to give their children the chance to walk. Because education authorities do not have the power to assist them, they have had to resort to raising all the funds themselves by, for example, sponsored walks, charity events and, in some cases, even re-mortgaging their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that help should be available to those parents, and to others who choose to go to foreign institutions in pursuit of the best provision for their children. The Institute for the Maximisation of Human Potential in Philadelphia is another place that Scottish parents have chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will give discretionary power to education authorities, which will enable them to meet all or part of the cost of a child with special educational needs attending an establishment abroad, including the travel and accommodation costs of parents or of another accompanying adult where appropriate. In deciding whether to provide assistance, I expect that authorities will take into account the cost that they would otherwise have incurred in making provision for those children in the United Kingdom. For example, the expense of a child with cerebral palsy and an accompanying parent going to Hungary for a year is less than the cost of some of the educational placements that we provide for such children in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying categorically that no new money will be made available to authorities for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that on this amendment at least we should reach unanimity. The provisions made to local authorities for education are part of the revenue support grant settlement. I have just said that it is cheaper to send a child to Peto than to place him in a residential establishment in this country. The Birmingham Institute for Conductive Education gave me figures showing that the cost of sending a parent and child to Peto is £12,000 a year. The cost of a residential placement in some Scottish institutions for a child with similar disabilities is £24,000 a year. However, this is not a financial argument. To be fair to local authorities, many have wished to exercise their discretion but have been prevented from doing so because the law did not allow them to make such a placement. Fortunately, the number of children involved is very small compared to the total provision for education. If local authorities were presented with particular difficulties, I assure the hon. Member for Moray that I should take the necessary action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 65 proposes a major extension of parental choice along the lines of the 1980 provisions for children who do not have special needs. The hon. Lady will recall that at the time the Opposition argued against those provisions. It has been a delight in this Committee to hear from the hon. Lady and Labour Members that they are committed to the parents' charter. The provisions of clause 65 are long overdue and the amendments will be welcomed by parents of handicapped children and by education authorities. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it was anticipated that this would be the first major debate of the afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1414</span>
The Opposition—or the Labour party—will support the amendment. However, I was anticipating a more extensive statement from the Minister on the wider implications of amendment No. 317 in particular. Many people heard the debates at the Conservative party conference, where a major announcement was made about the institute in Hungary. The Minister will have the opportunity to go further in the stand part debate, but it would have been useful if he had talked not only about the amendment, which is straightforward, but about its many implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) mentioned the financial implications for local authorities. The Minister rightly said that because this is such an important and sensitive subject, finances might not be the crucial issue, but that begs the question of the totality of provision for such disadvantaged and badly handicapped children in Scotland, relative to the provision provided in Hungary. Equally important, there is a ground swell of opinion in Scotland which suggests that there should be investment and an enormous increase in the resources available for children being dealt with by local authorities and specialist institutions in Edinburgh and elsewhere for a condition such as cerebral palsy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon's debate will be important. I hope that later the Minister will have more information about other aspects of his commitment made at the conference about the future of the treatment of handicapped children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
