	<br><blockquote><p>"which maintained a self-governing school before the incorporation date".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 182 and 183.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are technical amendments to simplify references to the "education authority", which is defined in clause 69(1) as the education authority in whose area a school or college is situated. So there can be no doubt as to which education authority is involved in relation to a self-governing school and the qualifications that the amendments would remove are unnecessary. The term "education authority" is also used without qualification in other provisions of the Bill and the amendments remove any possibility that there could be argued to be a distinction in law between the use of the term "education authority" in different contexts in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting to note that about 30 more Government amendments appeared in the notices of amendments on Friday 21 April. Was the Bill conceived so quickly that 50 Government amendments were necessary to clarify provisions that needed to be tidied up? That implies that the Bill was not properly constructed initially. There is a flood of Government amendments almost daily to tackle reasonably straightforward points. The haste with which the Bill was prepared is leading to daily changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a bit of a cheek. During our proceedings I have listened to arguments, most of which have come from my hon. Friends or from the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), and have agreed to consider what has been said. Where it has been possible to table amendments in response to promises that I have made in Committee I have done so. Some of the amendments about which the hon. Gentleman complains have
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
been tabled as a direct response to representations made in Committee. Those relating to clauses that we have already discussed will be dealt with later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has not had much experience in Committee, but most hon. Members, especially Conservative Members, are surprised that in a Bill of this complexity and length there are so few Government amendments, and many of those relate to concessions made in Committee. The Opposition were at pains to argue that there would be no concessions made and that the Committee stage would be a waste of time because the Government would go on in their own way. At the last count, I have made about 20 commitments to change the Bill in response to our deliberations. The hon. Gentleman is being extremely churlish to complain about Government amendments tabled as a result of those deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is not at all churlish; he is merely making an observation. We are all entitled to do that without the Minister becoming piqued and getting on his high horse. He should not be so sensitive. He should settle down and adopt a calmer pose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the amendments that the Minister has tabled, how many are in response to points made by Opposition Members and how many are to correct problems in the original drafting? The Minister gave the impression that the amendments had been tabled in response to pressure from Labour Members and from my Hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). Does he have any figures on that, or is it another example of his use of figures, when he throws them up in the air and selects the ones that he wishes to use?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where did the amendments that did not result from Opposition pressure come from? I have sat on a few Committees and I am surprised that, even on a Bill of this length and magnitude, so many Government amendments have been tabled. Perhaps my experience is not as great—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> We are getting some response from a sedentary position from the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I am grateful for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman goes to the Library, he will find a record of the hours that hon. Members have been in Committee. Will he accept that my attendance is better than most and that what is happening on this Committee is not unusual?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has attended many more Committees than me. He has done virtually everything in life better than me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was never a brain surgeon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman seems to be better than me at everything. I accept that he has manfully—in deference to my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>901</span>
Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), who is unfortunately ill, I should say, "personfully"—served on numerous Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us where all the amendments came from. Were they tabled in response to consultations with other groups such as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council or COSLA, or is it the normal tidying-up process that his clerks, civil servants and lawyers have to undertake? Out of interest, I hope that the Minister will reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has posed. The Opposition may be inexperienced, but the questions are fair. It is one thing if the amendments are in response to our arguments, but there are many amendments that do not come into that category. My hon. Friend made a fair point, but if the Minister is unwilling to reply, there is not much that we can do to evoke a response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 16, line 28, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and agreed with the education authority".</p></blockquote>
I shall try to be brief and to the point because my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has three large volumes in his briefcase that will enable him to make a lengthy contribution to the debate. I know that the Committee will look forward to that. I am pleased to hear the Minister say that the flood of Government amendments are concessions to the Opposition. I hope that the Minister will also agree to the reasonable and valid argument that supports my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the recovery of sums of money from the education authority of recurrent grant. It is the money that a self-governing school would have expected to have had spent on it if it had remained within the control of the education authority. If a school opts out, that money is transferred to the self-governing school. We are dealing with the possibility of the Secretary of State giving a school money and then recovering it from the education authority. Subsection (2) allows the money to be recovered and leaves the Secretary of State to determine when that money should be paid. The total amount may be calculated by the regulations that the Secretary of State for Scotland will lay before the House, or it may simply be the Secretary of State's estimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests that before the Secretary of State for Scotland lays any regulations before the House or makes any estimates, he first agrees with the education authority the amount that should be recovered in respect of any school that has opted out. That is a reasonable position for anyone to take in respect of the power that is given to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) pressed the Minister on that matter and asked him how the Secretary of State for Scotland would arrive at his
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
decision. When the Minister was pressed about the criteria that the Secretary of State might use, and about the definition of "comparative", he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we shall have to answer some of those question when we draft the grant regulations, but it will not help anyone in that process to insert general words in statute."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Minister refused to answer my hon. Friend's detailed questions and gave no information about the basis on which decisions will be taken. He simply told my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill to trust the Secretary of State for Scotland to be fair. However, the Secretary of State will not decide; the matter will be devolved to the Minister with responsibility for education. As I have repeated time and again, I am not convinced that the Minister can be trusted to act fairly in respect of the education authorities. It is not just because he was formerly associated with the No Turning Back group and with the pamphlet, "Save our Schools", with which we dealt this morning. That group, in turn, is associated with demands for the privatisation of schooling and picks up many of its ideas from a string of Right-wing bodies that are demanding the privatisation of schools not only in England and Wales, but in Scotland. The Institute of Economic Affairs, the Hillgate group, the Social Affairs Unit, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Adam Smith Institute and its Omega report—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] The mere mention of the Omega report gives rise to cheers from Conservative Members. I refer them to the unbiased opinion of the Adam Smith Institute, to be found in the 	<i>Labour Research</i> monthly. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Adam Smith Institute calls for the privatisation of practically anything that moves."—</p></blockquote>
we had better all stand still—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the past year or so it has called for the privatisation of degree courses, membership fees for libraries, and private treatment of NHS patients."</p></blockquote>
With such a background, the Minister cannot be trusted or given a blank sheet to decide the criteria upon which money will be recovered from education authorities—not only how it will be recovered but how much will be recovered—in respect of self-governing schools. We have some idea of how the Minister will go about that process. In the previous debate he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We envisage a round of consultation on the principles that will lie behind the grant regulations."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 April 1989; c.854-855.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Perhaps we should adjourn the Committee, as there is a Division in Room 9 and the hon. Gentleman clearly wants to go and vote on English matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, I shall be unable to vote in that Division. It is a shame because, although we have been defeated time and again in this Committee, we have the occasional success in Room 9. It is almost worth stopping my speech and going along the Corridor to vote in case it is another such occasion. But having been there this morning and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
seen how the forces are arranged on both sides of the Committee, I know that we are in for another defeat, so it will not matter if I do not vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he envisaged consultations with the education authority on the principles behind the grant regulations. He said that the money would be deducted so that the self-governing school would be on the same footing as it would have been if it had remained under the control of the education authority. The level of spending to be deducted would be determined by the education authority because it would decide how much money would be spent on a school. He explained that under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, education authorities have to provide annual accounts of their actual and proposed expenditure for each school under their control. Is that the total expenditure or expenditure per pupil?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time a school has implemented its decision to opt out of education authority control, those figures may have been published by the school board and a sum total of, say, £300,000 in recurrent grant may be required to run the school. However, some parents who are dissatisified about the school being taken out of education authority control may move their children from that school back into the education authority sector. If the education authority had to publish only the grand total and the Secretary of State for Scotland deducted money from the education authority, that would be unfair. The deduction would be based on expenditure in the previous year, even though many pupils might have transferred back into the education authority sector. The figure would have to be adjusted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Secretary of State for Scotland know exactly how much should be deducted from the education authority and given to the self-governing schools? We have asked the Minister time and again to give a clear response on that matter, but he has declined to do so and asked instead for us to trust him by giving him a blank sheet to consult the education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might listen politely to education authorities but ignore everything said to him and reach his own conclusions. The amendment would provide that the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Minister would have to agree with the education athority before he could deduct any money. He would not be able to impose his opinion on the authority but would have to reach an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that the Minister defended the powers given to him under the clause by saying that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the same procedure as has been adopted south of the border by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science".</p></blockquote>
On amendment No. 211, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main intention of the amendment … is contained in the final words, which would require the Secretary of State not to disadvantage an education authority school against a self-governing school."</p></blockquote>
That is also the purpose of amendment No. 194. But the Minister went on to say, "I find that opaque". I do not find it opaque to ask the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
or the Minister to give a guarantee that no education authority school will be financially disadvantaged by the powers under the clause. Rather than give a commitment that no education authority will suffer as a result of those powers, the Minister comes out with the ridiculous phrase, "I find that opaque".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wants the provision to be opaque because he does not want to be committed. He wants a free hand so that he can disadvantage the education authority and give significant advantage to self-governing schools. The Minister does not believe in education authority schools. He thinks that they are bad—that is the word that he used two years ago in the pamphlet "Save our Schools". He wants education authority schools to be disadvantaged so that Scottish parents will opt out of education authority control and opt in to self-governing status. If that is the Minister's motivation, we must assume that he will use the powers given to him under the clause to disadvantage education authority schools for the benefit of self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on amendment No. 211 the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The calculation of recurrent grant for a particular self governing school will have no direct consequences for any particular education authority school in the area."—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 April 1989; c. 855.]</p></blockquote>
I do not accept that. Earlier the Minister had given a list of the services currently provided centrally by education authorities to support schools under their control. They included:
	<br><blockquote><p>"payroll, accounting and book-keeping services; personnel management; purchasing of supplies and letting of contracts; advice on buildings and supervision of works; general administrative support and legal advice; the organisation of visiting specialist and supply teachers … the organisation of curriculum development … in-service training".—[	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 20 April 1989; c. 848.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister went on to say that the board of management would have the power and responsibility to decide how to provide such services. It will not necessarily be the case—indeed, the Minister implied that he did not think that it would be—that self-governing schools continue to purchase the services from the education authority rather than the private sector. If a board of management is to be allowed to do that, it must have the necessary funding. That means that when the Secretary of State for Scotland—or, in reality, the Under-Secretary— calculates the recurrent grant for a self-governing school, that grant will cover not only what is spent on teachers, books and equipment but also the list of services that I have just quoted. The money previously spent by the education authority on behalf of the school will be transferred to the board of management, which might decide to spend it by giving it back to the education authority or by buying-in services from the private sector. That would be to the detriment of the education authority, which would have to reduce the central services that it provided to the schools that remained under its control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong for the Minister to claim as he did that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The calculation of recurrent grant for a particular self-governing school will have no direct consequences for any particular education authority school".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
Of course it will. Schools that remain under education authority control will be affected by their authority's ability to provide central services. That ability will be compromised if self-governing schools take away some of the funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. Does he not realise that if a number of schools decide not to avail themselves of the central services, there will be less demand on those services? That will mean that fewer people will be needed to service the schools that remain in the maintained sector. In other words, the authorities' work load will be reduced so my hon. Friend the Minister is right to say that opting out will not have the impact that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion that the number of schools that opt out and buy their services from the private sector will neatly compensate the people who work in central services by reducing their work load is sheer guesswork. There is no neat, appropriate balance. If money is withdrawn from the education authority and given to the self-governing schools, the education authority will no longer be able to provide the central services to the same standard that it provided previously. There will be an adverse effect on the schools that remain under education authority control. Conservative Members do not care about that adverse effect because they do not like the schools that remain under education authority control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those central services will have an expertise that might not be available in the private sector. With their experience and staff, they have a unique opportunity to provide those services cost effectively both to the maintained schools and the opted-out schools. The hon. Gentleman is simply looking to the bleakest, worst prospect, whereas the proposals offer a tremendous opportunity to the central services units of the education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes the bleakest, worst prospect comes to pass, as in June 1987 when this Government were imposed on Scotland. I must argue on the worst case scenario because that might come about. I have never tried to argue that it is only the Minister and a handful of Back Benchers who feel as they do about education authority schools in Scotland. There is support in Scotland for the Minister's view and for the Conservative party, but that support is small. Even such a low level of support can have a damaging impact on the public sector in Scotland and that is what worries me. There will be significant damage to the education authority schools that remain under education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pamphlet, "Save our Schools", of which the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) was a co-author, suggests that, rather than taking the service directly from the education authority, self-governing schools should go to the private sector and appoint their own bursars to take over control of their financial affairs. The Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
repeated that possibility in the Committee, although he was careful not to say that it should happen. We must remember that while he is careful with his public utterances, privately he cheers inside when his Back Benchers cheer at the mention of privatising Scottish schooling and wrecking the public sector. The Minister loves that. He cannot say so publicly because he must defend his gradualist approach. He hopes that he will be able to cheer the destruction of the education authority sector in Scotland 10 years from now, but he will be sadly frustrated in that ambition. He and the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood have not fooled any hon. Member on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important. The Secretary of State for Scotland cannot be trusted because he has turned his back on his responsibilities and allowed the Minister to run riot through Scottish education. The Minister will make the decisions on how much money will be deducted from education authorities. He will not even care if the money that is deducted damages significantly the schools that remain in the education authority sector because he does not want any schools to remain in that sector. He wants all schools to opt out and acquire self-governing status, in line with the vision that he set out in "Save our Schools" in 1986. It might take him a while to get there, but that is his intention, as it has been always.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If what the hon. Gentleman says is correct, why did the Secretary of State turn down a proposal for a school in Hertfordshire to opt out on the basis that the school was too small and so was not big enough to govern itself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have just come into the Committee Room. When I refer to the Secretary of State, I mean the Secretary of State for Scotland. I think that the hon. Gentleman referred to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who has responsibility for education in England and Wales and about whom I have hardly spoken. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) finds it difficult to deal with the Scottish position because he is not interested in it. He continually wants to refer to what is happening in his own back yard. I am not interested in that. We are dealing with an important matter that affects schools in Scotland. The Minister cannot be trusted to deal fairly with the education authority sector. If he wants to prove me wrong, he should simply accept the amendment and agree that, before he deducts any money from an education authority he will agree with the authority that the sum to be deducted is fair not just to the authority, but to the self-governing school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an interesting speech. I do not recall ever being described as a gradualist before. However, I shall cherish the hon. Gentleman's description and put it in my scrapbook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to focusing on Scottish affairs, it is Opposition Members who find it difficult to be here in force for our deliberations. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), in particular, must be distracted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
by having to go along the Corridor to vote on English matters. He is not in a position to make an attack on my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may assist the Committee if I explain the context of this amendment to clause 26. Much of the hon. Gentleman's argument was to the affect that, ("We cannot trust the Minister, and we cannot give any value to his undertakings." When we give undertakings, we keep them, which is a lesson that Labour Members might like to take unto their hearts after their behaviour today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain what he is talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave an undertaking on Thursday night that we would be beginning debate on clause 28 by 12 noon today but he has not delivered. I am not worried when Labour Members talk about us giving undertakings and not meeting them. When we give undertakings, we stick to them. Any undertakings given during the course of Committee proceedings will be acted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26 provides for the recoverey by the Secretary of State from the education authority of money that he has paid out to a self-governing school that was formerly under the management of the education authority. The amounts will, as we have discussed on clause 25, relate to the level of funding that the school would reasonably expect to have received had it remained under education authority management. The net financial effect to the education authority will be neutral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of clause 26 provides that the amounts of sums recoverable and the date or dates on which they fall due—that is, the instalment arrangements for payments—shall be determined by the Secretary of State. The amendment would require those arrangements to be subject to agreement with the education authority. The Secretary of State will, of course, discuss with the eduction authority in each particular case what instalment arrangements would be most convenient. However, I cannot accept that the arrangement should formally be made subject to agreement with the education authority. That would mean that any education authority that wished to disrupt the arrangements for financial subsidy to a self-governing school need only refuse to agree to the Secretary of State's proposals for the instalment arrangements. That would be quite unacceptable, and I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, but the important point is that the authority should be consulted about the arrangements and I am happy to give the hon. Member for Dundee, East that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed at the Minister's initial reply and hope that he will listen to our further arguments on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not taken on board the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). One of our recurrent complaints is
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
the way that the Bill concentrates power to an excessive extent in the hands of the Secretary of State which, in practice, means that it will be concentrated in the hands of the Minister. We object to that most strenuously. It is odd that a party that is always preaching about the virtues of small-scale decision-making and getting away from control and power at the centre should be behind a Bill that will concentrate power at the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One result of what excessive concentration of power will be the loss of adequate democratic input from the local community. Having an education authority allows local people who are to be affected by its decisions a democratic say in those decisions through the ballot box. The Bill curtails that local community influence. The only recourse will be to the Secretary of State, a Secretary of State who represents a party that has no majority in Scotland and whose support in Scotland is at a miserably low level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members fail to take that point on board when they parrot their line about Scottish Members voting on English legislation and vice versa. They do not appreciate the fundamental gulf that has opened up in Scotland between the Government and the wishes of the Scottish people. It is not simply a matter of Ministers representing a minority party. The lowness of the vote that the Conservatives consistently poll in Scottish elections would give the Government cause for thought if they have any concern about the way that the United Kingdom operates as a political and constitutional framework. It should operate on the basis of a mutual trust that people will not push the boundaries too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman relate what he has just said to what happens when a Labour Government are in office and have no majority in England yet push legislation through to abolish grammar schools? The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Either this is a unitary United Kingdom Parliament and the Government of the day govern the whole of the United Kingdom or they do not. If he does not agree with that he is a nationalist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I want to talk about Scottish education. I am getting fed up listening to Opposition Members wasting time by wittering on with the same arguments over and over again. Let us go back to the amendment and get on with some work. That is what the people of Scotland would demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The hon. Gentleman knows that if any hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised that the hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
trying to make is that what faces us here is not simply a matter of a marginal majority one way or the other, but a consistent repudiation at the polls by overwhelming numbers of people in Scotland of Government policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. What has that last sentence got to do with the amendment before us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the education of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, our amendments is an attempt to diminish the impact of the Bill that concentrates the power excessively in the hands of the Secretary of State. We want to devolve that power more and to share it with the education authorities. We want to do that because we think that the education authorities are more representative of the Scottish people than is the Secretary of State for Scotland. By consistently repudiating the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Scottish people the Government are straining the constitution to its limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the Government agree to amendment No. 194. They must agree that they will have to engage in meaningful consultation with education authorities when deciding upon the specific sums that will be recovered by the Secretary of State. The Minister says that discussions will take place, but we know from past experience how one-sided those discussions will be and how deaf the Government will be to objections and points made by education authority representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can expect consultations to be meaningful only if a compulsive element is added to the clause, otherwise, the consultations will be void of any substance. The amendment will ensure that the Minister listens to and consults the education authorities. That is all the more necessary because we discovered from the debate on clause 25 that the principle of equivalence, which was supposed to operate so that self-governing schools received no more money than they would receive were they to remain in the education authority, had no meaning when applied for special purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recurrent funds are the only funds in which the principle of equivalence can have any hope of applying. It is crucial that education authorities are given power and leverage over the Minister on recurrent funds. If not, the cream of the capital budget for education and the cream of other funds allocated for the nebulous concept of special purposes will be diverted to any school that chooses to become self-governing. There is no doubt about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that capital funding will be established according to the priority given to each project, and, presumably, the same will be true of any special purpose funding. However, we know that the Minister's prime priority will be to ensure that any school that he has cajoled into opting out is seen by others to have benefited from that status. The most immediate way in which he can ensure that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
by giving its funding first priority. As self-governing schools will constantly be in the Minister's favour for capital and special purpose funding, it is important that there are some means by which the education authority can circumscribe the Minister's power on recurrent funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, the amendment would have only a negative effect and would not give education authorities power to boost the recurrent funding of their schools, but it would limit the Minister's power to remove such funding arbitrarily. Without that leverage and power any discussion between education authorities and the Minister will be an empty gesture towards consultation. It will have no substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the amendment were accepted, the education authority would not have sole power. We do not seek to remove the power from the Secretary of State and give it to the education authority; we merely wish to redress the imbalance between them. I hope that the Minister will think again about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), who continues to make such coherent and incisive contributions at great length, and without notes, but I shall not try to emulate him. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) also makes short, pungent contributions, although most are rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the points of order raised by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). It is not my job to adjudicate on them, but he seemed to be complaining that we raise the constitutional issue from time to time. Clause 26 deals with the Secretary of State's power to recover various moneys. That is an important constitutional issue for the Opposition: the Bill is relevant to the constitutional position in Scotland. A major issue is the relationship between the Secretary of State for Scotland and other parts of government in Scotland. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle should not be so dismissive about its importance. He should read the Scotland Bill of 1987 to find out about the devolution of power in education. It was an extremely well-drafted Bill—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I was dealing with that point briefly and responding to points raised by Conservative Members when they were filibustering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that he wanted to talk about education in Scotland. That came as a great surprise to me, as most Conservative Members spend their time reading their mail and talking to one another. They do not appear to be at all interested in debating education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must confine their remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 26 is important to education in Scotland, but Conservative Members are talking to one another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a clause stand part debate. We are discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks relate to clause 26 and consultation with the education authority, which is important, because the provision contains many vague words. For example, subsection (2), which deals with the recovery of the amounts, states that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall fall due on such date or dates; as may be determined by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us whether that is likely to be once a year, once a month or once every six months? The Minister will have trouble following my argument because he is talking to the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean). I shall speak slowly until they have finished their conservation. I shall repeat my question. Subsection (2) states that sums recoverable
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall fall due on such date or dates; as may be determined by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
How often that will be? It is especially relevant to subsection (6) of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) provides that the amount recoverable should relate to the recurrent expenditure of the self-governing school. What does that mean? Is it the same as, is it based on an estimate of, or will it be equivalent to, recurrent expenditure? The wording is vague and for that reason we should accept the amendment. It will be necessary to discuss matters with the education authority so that the matters can be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5)(b) states that amount recoverable might be based on an estimate of the total amount due. Again, the wording is vague. The Secretary of State might have to relate the amount recoverable to recurrent expenditure; that might be an estimate; and it might be charged on days that the Secretary of State sees fit. The clause contains three provisions that are vague and open to dispute. Therefore, it is important that the Secretary of State has full discussions with education authorities before the provisions are enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) provides that corrections may be made for overpayment. Will the Minister tell us for how far back those corrections will apply? If an overpayment was made five years earlier, would it still be corrected or will the corrections apply just to the previous financial year? I am not clear about the intentions of the clause. Again its wording is vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) deals with the recovery of aggregate amounts. The schools within an education authority area will be aggregated. Strathclyde has wonderful proposals to devolve power to the areas, but even now the budgets of divisions such as Dumbarton, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Glasgow are devolved. In one division, there might be an overpayment and in another an underpayment. The Secretary of State will attempt to claw back some of the money, but there will be a to-ing and fro-ing about finance between autonomous divisions of the education authority. It would be appropriate to discuss the recovery of sums with the education authority, especially when decision-making and budget-holding are devolved within it. To deal with that problem, I think that the Secretary of State can vary the revenue support grant.
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
We all know what controversies and punch-ups that will produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is vague and covers estimates that can be varied. It deals with various forms of clawbacks for overpayments that can be aggregated within an education authority area as large as Strathclyde. Those provisions will have important financial implications for an education authority. Therefore, surely it is imperative that the Secretary of State discusses the amounts involved with the education authority before he reaches a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend consider why such an elementary omission was made? The funding authority is the local education authority. Why does my hon. Friend think that it has been by-passed and centralised under the power of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, would rule me out of order if I went into detail about that matter. It would take me a long time—probably the rest of the evening—to explain the reason for the provision. It is a part of the ethos of the Bill to ensure that education authorities are controlled by the centralised power of the Secretary of State's negation of democracy. What the Government cannot do by democratic means, they do by other means. The clause is wide-ranging, and covers how grants can be varied and how sums can be recovered, I understand the reason behind it, but it is vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said "opaque".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is always telling us how great and usual it is for the Government to table so many amendments. Therefore, I am surprised that he has not tightened up some of the vague words in the clause, as they leave much scope for discussion and dispute. The Scottish Office will no longer just be involved in disputes with regions about the grants they receive. It will be in dispute with the handful of schools that opt out, which will want to know what is happening about their grants. He will have the same trouble with opted-out schools as he does with umpteen regional authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way in which to avoid regular punch-ups is for the Bill to ensure that, before decisions are made about the recovery of grants, education authorities are consulted fully. They will be only too willing to assist the Minister and to work within the bounds of the regulations and laws laid down by Parliament. I do not know whether it was the Government's intention that the clause should be vague or whether it was difficult to make it more specific. If it were the latter, there is all the more reason why education authorities should be consulted fully on the amount and the dates when the adjustments will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises serious issues. In the clause stand part debate, we can return to the wider issues about who the Government are keen to consult and who they are keen to ignore. The amendment is simple and, again, it was met with much indifference from the Minister. It is a curious phenomenon that, when education authorities have made such a tremendous contribution to the welfare,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
education and attainment of so many children, there is an elementary omission in a clause that governs the funding provisions of self-governing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends said, perhaps the Government's long-term objective is to ensure that education authorities start to play a lesser role in the welfare of education. It is also curious that education authorities are by-passed, because they are the experts in providing finance for educational spending. At regional council and island level, they have worked with local government officials who determine the budgets of most authorities. The Government like to forget that Scottish education authorities exist 400 miles away and are working every day of every year on financial matters concerned with the provision of education. That budget process is complex and time-consuming. It is difficult to make clear judgments about the future requirements of opted-out schools, especially with such a centralisation of power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with recurrent grants. In two other areas, the Minister has an open cheque book with which to do as much damage as he wants to the education authority sector while enhancing opted-out schools. The two grants held within the Scottish Office preserve have major implications. A sensible procedure should be adopted. It is shocking that the clause excludes a principal partner in the provision of education and in the negotiation for a sensible transfer of a school from the education authority sector to self-governing status. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that malice permeates every clause of the Bill. Any reasonable person would assume that financial procedures include discussions with the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister, having accepted extra consultation provisions in other parts of the Bill, will not do so for the important area of government finance and its implications for opted-out schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems hours since I spoke, but it is not. My last words were to ask the Committee to reject the amendment because I was happy to give an undertaking that the authority would be consulted about the arrangements. Why is the hon. Gentleman continuing to argue that the local authority should be consulted when I gave that undertaking more than a half an hour ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are raising an important point. The Government are increasingly supported by the new Right in education, who would like the Minister to ignore the wishes of education authorities. Why was this provision not written into the Bill initially? Why does an Opposition amendment illicit such response from the Government? They want us to withdraw the amendment and they will consider consultation. Our point is that education authorities were excluded from the Bill and only when the matter was raised did the Minister give his assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the Minister's track record and his typical attitude to consultations, without the
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
amendment the local authorities will have no power or leverage to ensure that the Minister listens to their concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is less charitable than I, but we are concerned that assurances on consultation should be built into the Bill before amendments are withdrawn. We are arguing that an important part of the education process should have been built into the Bill instead of the Government grudgingly making a token concession to education authorities. The Committee may bypass and ignore education authorities but they provide education for about 770,000 children—only 32,000 children are in the independent sector. Education authorities employ 50,000 teachers and about 1.5 million parents are involved in the education partnership. So why do the Government only ever mention the education authority as an afterthought when the Opposition usefully suggest that it is written into the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to strain your tolerance, Mr. Martin, by talking about matters that would be suitable for the clause stand part debate, but we support the fundamental principle that if there is to be a debate about the future of Scottish education, it is crucial that the education authority is accepted—albeit unwillingly by the Government—as a partner who deserves to be heard, and who is able to contribute to any debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recovery of sums, which we debated on previous clauses, relating to finance and recurrent grant is crucial. We are disappointed by the Minister's response but he has assured us that education authorities will appear somewhere and will be consulted. As the Minister is flush with new amendments to include education authorities and save us from having continually to raise the matter in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points of substance arise from the comments made by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). He asked me about corrections for overpayments if they were made five years ago. The answer is yes, they could be made within a limited time. The hon. Gentleman did not seem to understand that that was to the education authorities' advantage. It is in their interest to be compensated in respect of a historic overpayment. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the provisions in the clause. We shall expect him to agree that the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) implied that my assurances about consultation were an afterthought and that we would not consult education authorities. Of course, my hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will consult them. The amendment does not deal with consultation, but would prevent my hon. and learned Friend from acting without the agreement of the education authority, which would be absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astounded that the debate on an amendment that was tabled to probe whether there would be consultation, and which has obtained assurances, is not being drawn out. The hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
Strathkelvin and Bearsden smiles sweetly, confirming my suspicion. I do not know what it is about clause 28 that frightens the Opposition. I suspect that one of them has been clever enough to understand the meaning of one of their amendments and now seeks to avoid it by drawing out the debate. The Opposition have nothing to be afraid of if they withdraw amendment No. 194. If the Opposition are not afraid of getting on to clause 28, perhaps we can make progress, because the clause is of fundamental importance to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked why we do not accept his assurances and move on. That is partly because of our experiences. He will remember the assurances that he gave to the Women's Royal Voluntary Service in Stirling about the security of its service in Stirling Royal infirmary. Only a few weeks later the WRVS received a letter from the health board saying that it was out, without any consultation at all. That is why we always pursue these points. An assurance from the Minister that our amendment is unnecessary is not enough. It needs to be written in. As the good ladies of the WRVS in Stirling will confirm, assurances from the Minister mean absolutely nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I moved the amendment. I should point out that there has been no attempt to delay the Committee's proceedings. I dealt with a central argument, to which the Minister did not even refer, when I listed 13 different services which are currently centrally provided by education authorities. Those services will be vitally affected if this subsection is passed without the assurance that they will be protected if the Minister allocates how much money goes to the self-governing schools and how much money has to be recovered from the education authority. The Minister never referred to that part of my argument. The Minister does not usually miss points from debates. I interpret his silence here to mean that he wants a free hand to do whatever he can to give advantage to the self-governing schools and to disadvantage the education authority schools, through this subsection. That is why he does not want to say so publicly in this Committee at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's commitment to consult with the education authorities. However, we have learnt from bitter experience in Scotland that any kind of consultation that the Government carry out is worthless. If the Government had consulted Scotland about the poll tax, poll tax demands would not now be dropping through our letter boxes. Hostility to the poll tax was almost universal in Scotland, and the Government knew that. Local authorities, Scottish churches, trade unions and the electorate totally rejected the poll tax. The Government carried out the best possible consultation exercise. They put in their manifesto, and fought a general election on a commitment to introduce the poll tax. They were decisively defeated and they decided to ignore the consultation process with the Scottish people and to impose it regardless. I suspect that that is exactly what will happen here. When they come to consult with the education authorities, the Minister or someone else will be sent along to listen politely and then will completely ignore what they have to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that not be reneging on an undertaking given by the Secretary of State recently to COSLA? COSLA said that there was a new era of consultation and that they were all buddies and would all cuddle up together. Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do indeed. With every sitting of this Committee, it becomes clear that the Secretary of State for Scotland is a straw man who has no influence and who wields no influence inside the Cabinet. It is the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who carries out the Prime Minister's bidding and who has her ear. The Secretary of State for Scotland is merely the window dressing to try to sell Tory policies in Scotland under a more reasonable facade than the hon. Member for Stirling would present. The hon. Member for Stirling is held in general contempt in Scotland but that contempt is slightly less for the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). That is why they have this double act of Mutt and Jeff. Mutt is up front and seems to be a nice guy whom everyone can like, but behind him Is Jeff who puts the boot in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even he knows when to step back a pace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the fact that members of the Committee are anxious to make progress. There is no point dividing the Committee on the amendment—not least because we shall get beaten.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we examine the clause carefully before deciding, collectively, whether it should stand part of the Bill. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If some members of the Committee pay more attention, we can have a meaningful debate on the clause.

I have grave reservations about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had much argument on the clause. Will the hon. Gentleman explain in one sentence what further needs to be added by Opposition Members that has not already been

mentioned to great effect by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at that intervention. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was speaking to the amendment then before us not the clause. Therefore, he could not possibly cover the many points that the clause throws up when it is examined more closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had some useful contributions from the hon. Member for Dundee, East but, sadly, they were all too short. He was unable to encompass the full text of "Save our Schools", published by the No Turning Back group. Will the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) fill us in with those estimable sections that have not already been quoted? If he is short of material, I shall be happy to provide him with the necessary text so that he may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I have not read the text. If the hon. Gentleman cares to provide me with a copy, I shall read it; I have quite an appetite for reading. Not having read the publication, I cannot comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to concentrate on the clause. The first and most striking omission from the clause has to do with a matter that my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) touched on, although he did not make the point that I am about to make. The Minister replied to my hon. Friend's point and I hope that when he replies to this debate, he will be able to satisfy us, on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all its provisions, the clause does not give a date by which the Secretary of State will have to tell an education authority that, because one of its schools has opted out, it is receiving an overpayment of recurrent funds which is no longer appropriate and which it must repay. That could be called a statute of limitations subsection in the clause. It seems fair and reasonable that an education authority should not have to live under the threat, month after month, year after year and endlessly into the future, of a Secretary of State looking through the dust-covered books and discovering an overpayment on the sum three, four, five, or six years before, which had not yet been recovered. Under the clause, the Secretary of State could recover that overpayment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does not the hon. Gentleman want to debate clause 28 in prime time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking forward eagerly to discussing clause 28, but I am anxious that we give each clause proper scrutiny. That is supposed to be what our constituents pay us to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends looking forward to discussing clause 28 late into the night when the gentlemen of the press are not present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing clause 26 at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An accusation that could never be made about my speeches is that they play to the gallery. It is irrelevant to me whether the press is present. I expect that we shall still be discussing clause 28 on Thursday morning, so the press will have an opportunity to hear our debates then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that clause 26 does not specify a point beyond which the Secretary of State can no longer inform an education authority that, having reexamined its books, he intends to deduct an overpayment made five years before. It seems reasonable to remove that uncertainty hanging over an education authority, but the clause seems to suggest the opposite. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The total amount so recoverable shall be such as may be determined (and from time to time revised)".</p></blockquote>
The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"from time to time revised"</p></blockquote>
suggests an infinite period during which a Secretary of State could apply the provisions of the clause to funds that were paid out many years before. Subsection (8)(a) and (b) give the Secretary of State the power to require the authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"to pay the whole or any part of any such sum"</p></blockquote>
that he considers to be recoverable, or to deduct it from any sum that he pays out in a particular year
	<br><blockquote><p>"at such time or times as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
That is an open-ended provision that gives the Secretary of State the ability to demand at any time that sums paid out some years before are now due. The clause should include the notion of a statute of limitations so that the bureaucrats in the Scottish Office who deal with that matter have an incentive to get it right. Under the Bill it does not matter how wrong they get it, or that they do not realise that they have got it wrong until some years hence. They can recover the financial losses caused by their error. A statutory limitation would inspire and encourage them to be as precise as they can. If a mistake were found out once the statute of limitations had passed, the official could be in hot water because he would have lost the Government that amount of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that worries me is the phrasing of subsection (5), which deals with how the amount to be recovered is to be estimated. Subsection (5)(a) says that regulations will determine how the recoverable sum is to be estimated. However, subsection (5)(b) contains an incredible escape clause for the Secretary of State and his officials. Where they cannot estimate the recoverable sum but have a vague feeling that an overpayment has been made, the subsection empowers the Secretary of State to make a stab in the dark about the amount that the local authority must pay. It will be based entirely on that wild guestimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5)(b) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any other case"—</p></blockquote>
That is when the Secretary of State cannot work out his sums—the amount will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"any amount estimated by the Secretary of State … which the Secretary of State considers is appropriate to adopt for the time being as a basis for determining the amounts".</p></blockquote>
Whenever the Secretary of State cannot do his sums, he can pluck a figure out of the air and demand that sum from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>919</span>
The subsection is deplorable. I referred to incentives for officials to get the amount right in good time, but there should be an equal incentive for the Secretary of State to do his sums, not to thrash about and make wild guesses about the appropriate amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government often have problems with their statistics, so perhaps it is not surprising that they have included an escape clause. They had to revise their medium-term financial strategy half a dozen times; they were always revising their monetary targets when they had them, and the Chancellor has recently had trouble predicting the balance of payments deficits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. What relevance does the balance of payments and the Chancellor's predicament have to the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must stick to clause 26 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall not mention the balance of payments deficit again. It obviously strikes a sore nerve among Conservative Members. The Government have consistently made a statistical hash. They always get the figures wrong. I suppose that they have included subsection (5)(b) as an escape clause because they lack confidence in their ability to get the figures right. If they cannot even make a stab at the figure, they will make one up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman in making his speech even longer, which is his primary aim. There has been much talk about the No Turning Back group so I shall now read our pamphlet:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the 30-year history"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have long readings during interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I should have thought that hon. Members would be more interested in the No Turning Back group's leaflet than in the tedious, irrelevant and repetitious speech of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The point that I am making is that the hon. Gentleman cannot read out a pamphlet during an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would love to talk about what I understand to be the point of the No Turning Back group's latest document. They are running scared from the idea of the European Community.— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is far too much noise. The hon. Gentleman must be heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I hope that we shall receive a copy of the latest document.
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
It amazes me to see the Right-wing of the supposedly progressive Conservative party coalescing around little Englander attitudes towards the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue to talk about clause 26. I was saying that subsection (5)(b) is a deplorable escape clause. Combined with the absence of any date by which the Secretary of State should be required to inform an education authority that certain sums are recoverable in respect of recurrent funds from a previous year, it makes the clause utterly unfair in its impositions on education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point—I want to be as brief as I can— relates to a point made by the Minister. He cited the provisions of subsection (6) in responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Subsection (6) appears to give education authorities something from the clause because it provides that excess amounts recovered by the Secretary of State-presumably due to his incompetence and failure to add up the figures for the previous year—can be repayable to them. That provision is entirely proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My problem is the third word in subsection (6)— "may". It implies that the Secretary of State has the option of paying or not paying education authorities sums that he wrongly recovered from them earlier. Surely the provision should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recovery regulations shall provide for"</p></blockquote>
paying back to education authorities any sum that is wrongly taken from them in a previous year. It should not be an option and left to the Secretary of State's discretion. If he added up the figures wrongly and took more than he should, he should be obliged to return the difference. The provision should read "shall" rather than "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that it might not be known whether too much money had been recovered from an education authority in any one year and so the Secretary of State might not be aware of an error, but the subsection could provide that if money had been over-recovered from an education authority, the Secretary of State should be obliged to repay it. Again, that seems entirely reasonable and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to be brief and not to succumb to the ideological, fevered ramblings of Conservative Members, but rather to make three fairly constructive points, to which I hope that the Minister can respond equally constructively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am shocked that no Conservative Member wishes to speak in this important debate. Conservative Members do not treat the Bill with the seriousness that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have had an interesting debate. I share the grave doubts expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles that the clause should stand part of the Bill. Earlier the Minister said that he was pleased to be described by me as a gradualist. That word is always used relatively. The Minister may think that I think that he is a gradualist; I assure him that I do not. In fact, the Prime Minister has said that she sees this Bill as being as big a revolution as 1 million people transferring from the public sector to owner-occupied houses. So if the right hon. Lady
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>921</span>
sees it in a revolutionary sense, I am sure that the Minister does, too, although he wants to get there gradually by stealth without alerting the Scottish people to what he is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I wonder whether you could adjourn the Committee because the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) wants to dash out every time that there is a Division in Committee Room 9? As he is now on his feet and there is a Division, perhaps the Committee should be adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am willing to make a bogus point of order to give the hon. Gentleman time to leave the Room, to vote, and to return. I am prepared to stay on my feet and talk to help him out of his predicament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members should know better than to make bogus points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having a string of bad luck.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Dundee United.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not like Dundee United. It has been very successful in years past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should not be pleased that I called him a gradualist, because I used the term in a derogatory way. For example, some would say that Pol Pot was a gradualist compared to Hitler. I do not compare the Minister to either of those two, but I hope that he gets my drift. He is a gradualist on the fringes of the extreme Right wing of Scottish politics and, therefore, he is to be distrusted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply to the debate on the amendments to the clause, the Minister said that the net financial effect on education authorities of the power to recover sums of money from them would be neutral. I cannot accept that. Conservative Members have asked us to refer again to the famous document "Save our Schools", which was produced by the No Turning Back group of Right-wing Conservative Members, many of whom are on the Committee. Earlier, when I raised the subject, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) seemed to be embarrassed by the document. It appeared that he wished to disown himself from it and he referred to it as obscure and not relevant to the debate. Now, the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) is waving it in triumph as a symbol of his virility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is tomorrow's document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I thought it was "Save our Schools". I cannot see from this distance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that the greatest works of literature and the most influential pamphlets start in obscurity. They cease
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
to be obscure when their political opponents insist on repeatedly talking about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point. "The Communist Manifesto" is still talked about among Conservative Members. Works that began in obscurity tend to come through in the long run. However, that is what worries me. I am afraid that "Save our Schools" will have more influence on Scottish education and that will have serious implications. If there are decent people left in the Conservative party, I hope that they will use their influence to ensure that the document plays no part in the future of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is relevant to the debate because the clause deals with the effect that the recovery of money will have on education authorities. Page 29 of the document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The same money…is available for education. It is just spent much more efficiently by being allocated directly to the school in the form of a grant based on the number of pupils. By eliminating a middle layer of bureaucracy, the amount available for the education of each child is increased."</p></blockquote>
No doubt, that is what the Minister thought in 1986, and that is the reasoning behind the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no extra money available for Scottish education when self-governing schools come into being. Expenditure will stay the same, but it will be allocated differently. Instead of being allocated to the education authorities, it will be partly allocated to the self-governing schools and partly to the authorities. That means that money given to self-governing schools will be at the expense of the education authorities. That is an important principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, we discussed centrally provided services. As I said at that time, the hon. Gentleman was full of doom and gloom and too pessimistic about the chances of centrally provided services being available to the maintained sector. The hon. Gentleman should add to his reading material the excellent pamphlet by the IEA education unit entitled "Opting to Grant Maintained Schools". He will find an interesting chapter written by the headmaster of Skegness grammar school, Mr. Webster, in which he states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We seek to buy-in some the centrally-provided services where we acknowledge the LEA's superiority in its provision."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman's fears are not borne out by the English experience. He should be encouraged by that and tell his friends in the education authorities to go out to capture the markets that will be available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can only capture the market when the people in it are interested in buying the services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "But they are" means some boards of management, or governing bodies, as they are called in England. We do not know who the boards of management will be. We do not know which schools will be self governing. Everything is guesswork. My guess is that there may be people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
who share the perspective of the hon. Member for Stirling—the Minister responsible for education— whose ultimate aim is to undermine and destroy Scottish education as it exists and replace it with an entirely new model. There are such people in charge of boards of management who will certainly not buy the centrally provided services from the education authority, but will buy them from the private sector which, for ideological reasons, they believe is always superior to anything provided through the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "Save our Schools" document proposed eliminating a middle layer of bureaucracy. That is an innocuous phrase when read the first time, but it covers all the people I listed who are currently employed by the education authority. That includes the people who do the payroll, accounting, bookkeeping, personnel management, those purchasing supplies and those providing legal advice and in-service training. The people providing those services make up the middle layer of bureaucracy that the Minister wishes to eliminate. There is no getting away from that because the hon. Gentleman has put his name to a document which says that explicitly. He is including this clause in this Bill as a stage post on the road to achieving that wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I am worried. That is why I do not think that the clause should stand part of the Bill. This is a serious matter. The Minister cannot get away with assuming that if he states something in Committee, it is true, so that because he says that the net financial effect on education authorities will be neutral, it will be neutral. It will not be neutral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous debate, the Minister failed to deal with my serious point on centrally provided services. I hope that when he replies to the clause stand part debate, he will deal with that problem and tell us that when a self-governing school is set up, spending power on publicly funded education in the area will automatically be transferred from the education authority to the self-governing school. Will it be within the self-governing school's remit to use that spending power to employ its own bursar, lawyer, personnel manager and secretarial support, and not seek those services from the education authority? If self-governing schools can make such decisions, the education authority's capacity to maintain its present level of centrally provided services must, of necessity, be compromised and the education authority staff who provide those services must be sacked because although there will be work for them to do, there will not be the funds to pay their wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will deal with that problem when he tells us the amount of grant that he will claw back from education authorities, including the sums that cover the areas that I mentioned, and what impact that will have on the education authorities and their ability to provide centrally provided services to the rest of the schools that remain under their control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made a great deal of the fact that he is prepared to consult with local authorities before making decisions of this kind. However, he fails to realise something that we have stressed time and
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
time again—nobody trusts that consultation process. What is the point of a consultation process with someone who does not listen and goes his own way? That is what the Minister is about, which is why we do not trust him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen when the Minister consults with the education authority about the amount of grant that he will take back because a school in the area has become self-governing, and the authority does not agree with his decision? It may think that the Minister is being grossly unfair, that he has not taken everything into consideration and is ignoring vital parts of argument which would change the amount of money to be clawed back. If the Minister then says, "I don't care what you think, I am imposing my decision on you" that is unfair and offensive to any genuine democrat. There must be a court of appeal beyond the Secretary of State for Scotland to which the education authority can refer the decision. The Secretary of State cannot act as a tyrant in these matters, and get his own way whatever the circumstances. There must be some way in which the education authority can feel that what is being done is sensible. Even if it does not agree with the principle, it can at least agree that the principle has been applied fairly. Powers given to the Secretary of State mean that he can apply principles unfairly and that education authorities can do nothing about it. That worries us. Furthermore, the Minister has not dealt with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A free market approach runs through the document "Save our Schools". If everything is left to the market, of necessity, funds will be unfairly allocated. Resources will be allocated to those with the greatest purchasing and spending power or the most influence; in this case, self-governing schools will have the most influence in attracting resources from the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition prefer a planned approach to the provision of education. We want to ensure that every school is treated fairly on its needs for recurrent grant, special purposes grant, or capital grant. Allocation of resources will not be determined by consumer demand, as the Minister argued. Only a minority of consumers will be made a priority. The Minister says that it does not matter what the majority want; if one small group wants to opt out, to have separate funding and be given preference on capital spending and recurrent grant, he will do all in his power to help it. That is anything but meeting consumer demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consumer demand in Scotland is for money to be channelled through education authorities and allocated on the basis of the political parties that control education authorities and that have sought and received a mandate from the people to allocate those resources. But the Minister is not satisfied with local democracy in Scotland; he wishes to impose his solution on certain parts of education authorities, irrespective of local wishes and majority consumer demand. He wishes to give preference to a minority who share his narrow and limited view. That is unfair and a fundamental flaw. The whole decision-making process is weighted in favour of the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister who is responsible for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
education, and a few boards of management and self-governing schools. Those schools will become the focus of all priorities in the allocation of education resources; the rest will be second-rate, second-class and left to rot. The document "Save our Schools" makes it clear that the education authority system will be left to rot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) hit the nail on the head when he said that the heart of clause 26 was the principle of equivalence and that that principle had no meaning when applied to capital grant or special purposes grant. If it had any meaning at all, it would have to apply to the way in which recurrent grant was allocated between the two sectors. The Minister has shown himself to be reluctant to spell out how recurrent grant will be allocated, not because he does not know—he knows how he will allocate funds and how he will claw money back from education authorities—but because he does not want to tell us. He wants a cloak of legality on his road to power. He tries to pretend that he will consult and reach agreement with education authorities before he imposes the recurrent clawback on them. He has no intention of consulting; he knows what he intends to do, but he does not want to admit it in Committee because it will forewarn public opinion in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland has a completely free hand. That is why the Opposition oppose the clause.

I wonder whether the Minister will refer to the fact that the poll tax is likely to have an impact on the finances of education authorities. Will he take that impact into consideration when he applies the powers given in clause 26? For example, in Dundee the poll tax has been introduced at £324 a person, which is significantly higher than the Minister of State suggested. He was out by £44, which does not give me great confidence in the powers of the Secretary of State for Scotland to estimate expenditure under clause 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As non-domestic rates are treated separately in Scotland, they will rise in line with inflation. When local authority inflation is higher than the general level of inflation, it will lead to a higher poll tax next year. The next year for Scottish regional councils is 1990. It is likely that many will set a poll tax that is higher than this year's and that the 1990 regional council elections will be fought on that basis. It is possible that in some areas—or rather, one area— of Scotland the Conservatives will regain power by fighting the elections on the ground that they will introduce a lower poll tax. The Under-Secretary also said that in 1990 he expects the first schools to opt out. In those circumstances, when he estimates the amount of education authority expenditure that should be allocated to those schools, will he base his accounting principles on what the previous regional Labour administration had calculated on the basis of a higher poll tax, or on the new calculations on which the incoming Conservative administration fought the regional council elections? There could be a significant difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfair if the Minister allocated resources based on those that the Labour
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
administration would have had if it had won the election, because that would involve allocating a far higher level of expenditure to self-governing schools. In reality there might be a Conservative administration by then, which would levy a higher poll tax and have much lower expenditure. There could be an exaggerated impact on the remaining education authority schools. The Minister must say how he will make his calculations and whether a change in the poll tax will have an implication for them. I am sure that the Committee would be interested to find out more from the Under-Secretary as the Secretary of State is not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the flow of money that goes to a self-governing school and that is clawed back from the education authority be the initial year plus inflation, or will it be recalculated every year in accordance with the regional council's spending on education for that year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26(1) gives the Secretary of State power to impose recovery on the education authority and he can use that power as he sees fit. Let us compare that with the power given to a regional council to recover poll tax from those who refuse to pay it. The regional council cannot recover it as it sees fit, with a 10 per cent, surcharge plus costs, and that is from people who are in its debt. The Government do not allow a regional council to have such powers. They are covered by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987, which limits the amount of money that a regional council can recover from an individual in terms of poll tax liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) deals with circumstances in which the education authority has not committed an offence or broken the law, but the Secretary of State has complete freedom to take as much money from the regional council as he sees fit and the council has no say. The Secretary of State might listen to it but he does not have to act on what it says. He will merely impose the sum to be recovered which he thinks fit. That is unfair and no one on the Conservative Benches can believe that it is fair or tolerable. I see that there is a Conservative Member who can understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>927</span>
debate that clause on Thursday morning, Tuesday morning, or even the Thursday after that, but we have reached the point now of debating this serious clause and that is what we are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has the power to decide on the timing of the recovery of payments. That is not a neutral power. In handling their financial affairs, regional councils sometimes keep back money to invest, so as to earn interest from that investment. They generally juggle with the finances under their control so that they can ensure that the ratepayers, as they used to be, or the poll tax payers, as they are now, will get the maximum benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (2) the Minister suggests that he will interfere with that process by telling regional councils that they cannot decide how best to handle their financial affairs and that he will decide for them. He will take away from them the power to decide how much money they can keep in reserve, invest and earn interest from and he will transfer that money to the self-governing schools. The boards of management of those schools can then decide that they will invest the money and earn interest from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should boards of management, and not regional councils, be able to earn interest by investing that money? The Minister might say that that is because he prefers self-governing schools, and that at least would be honest. However, I doubt that he will say that because he will come up with another obscure or opaque argument that will try to justify the way in which he will prejudice the ability of regional councils to serve the best interests of their poll tax payers at the same time as enhancing the powers of the boards of management to enable them to make a quick buck from invesments that were transferred to them from the regional councils. The Committee should consider that serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not even looked at those amendments, so I could not answer the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) provides for the corrections that can take into account any excess that is recovered in relation to estimated amounts for previous years. That undermines the financial planning in which regional councils necessarily must become involved. Tayside regional council has a budget of about £250 million. To spend that money properly, it must be certain of how much money is coming in, how much it can spend, when it will have the money and how the money will be allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A terrible feature of the old local government finance system was the uncertainty that was built
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
into that system. Regional councils never knew what actions the Secretary of State for Scotland would take against them, whether there would be financial penalties or clawback, or whether their finances would be readjusted from the previous to the current year. Sometimes a budget would involve money that was readjusted for four years previously to cover the Secretary of State's mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A justification for introducing the poll tax was that it would remove the confusion from local government finance and introduce a clear and simple system. Regional councils would know how much money they would have to spend and they could spend it confidently. This clause now introduces a whole new element of uncertainty into local government financial planning. Authorities will not know how much money will be recovered from them in any given year for schools which have opted out, as the Secretary of State for Scotland can recover money for previous years. There will be a new element of confusion and uncertainty. Regional councils will have difficulties planning their expenditure. So far, no member of the Committee has debated that serious matter, but I hope that it is something that the Minister will consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is one of the great supporters of the poll tax and of making local government finance simple and easily understood by ordinary electors. We are told that the point of the poll tax is to make regional councils more accountable, so that poll tax payers will know what they are about. But how will poll tax payers understand the workings of local government if there is such added uncertainty? The average elector will not know whether the regional council is spending its money wisely. The money which it has at its disposal will change in extent from week to week and month to month, because of the Secretary of State's ability to make continual adjustments for schools that have opted out. The recovery of grants will be a complex procedure and few people, other than those in the closed circle of financial officials in regional councils, will understand it. It will only confuse the issue and make it much harder for the average elector to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about subsection (9), which requires that the sums recovered by the Secretary of State from an education authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund."</p></blockquote>
As we in Scotland have experienced with the oil revenues, once money is paid into the Consolidated Fund, God knows what will happen to it. It will disappear into the Government's general revenues. How will such a provision be monitored? Will it be left entirely to the Secretary of State for Scotland and his crony, the Minister, to decide whether the money that is recovered from the education authorities is then given to the self-governing schools? We will not know. We shall have to accept that the Minister has really put the money into the Consolidated Fund and given exactly the same amount to the self-governing schools. That is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some way in which the process will be monitored, so that education authorities will know what happened to the money that was taken from them. Furthermore, boards of management of self-governing schools should also know what happened
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
to that money and whether they have received the same amount. I should not put it beyond the Government to recover the money from an education authority, hold it for three or four months so that it could earn interest for them, and then give it to the self-governing school. They would be denying education authorities and boards of management the benefit of that money and make a profit from money that should have been invested in education in Scotland. That really upsets me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the infamous document "Save our Schools", to which so many Conservative Members lent their names. However, there are several honourable exemptions. Clearly, the Minister with responsibility for housing and the environment the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), would never put his name to such an atrocious piece of educational backwardness. Those who drafted the document argued that money, which is spent locally, seems to come from local government, but that it comes mainly from taxes that are raised by central Government. They were worried that education authorities were allocating resources that came from central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 25, 26 and 27 are an attempt by the Government to regain direct control of those resources, and take them away from education authorities. That is an important principle to grasp when dealing with such provisions. Until now, there has been a consensus across the parties that the allocation of resources to education, housing and so on was a matter to be decided locally, but that central Government laid down minimum standards that each local authority had to meet. The clause completely undermines the consensus. A small hard core of extremists who by chance have come to dominate a much-reduced Conservative party in Scotland are using their position to undermine the consensus about local democracy. They want to regain control of the allocation of resources for central Government to pursue their own political priorities in defiance of what local areas might wish to happen. That is why the Secretary of State for Scotland has wide powers to recover grant from education authorities and to allocate it as he sees fit. It is not up to the parents to make the decision. A small elite of parents will make the decision to opt out and to seek direct funding from central Government. Central Government will then decide for themselves how much of the resources will be allocated to those small groups of parents. Central Government will decide whether the priority for the allocation of resources locally should be the small elite group of schools or the larger maintained group of schools that remain under education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fundamentally political clause which goes to the heart of the counter-revolution which the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), seeks to carry through in Scotland to overturn all the gains that have been made since the second world war by the application of Socialism to Scotland's problems. That is why we so fundamentally oppose it and why we will continue to do so. We are not frightened to debate anything. It is the Minister who wants to confine the debate to
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
this Committee Room in this city and does not want to take the debate back into Scotland to the people who should be allowed to settle it. There is no doubt that when the debate is taken back to Scotland it will be won by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When discussing amendment No. 194, I remember asking the Minister questions about the period for assessing overpayment. I do not want to go over that ground again. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that the clause is not technical. The Minister may try to palm it off as a technical clause about financial accounting, but my hon. Friend is right: the clause goes to the heart of the Bill. It is one of the most important clauses because it invests power with the Secretary of State for Scotland. It takes power away from the local communities, from the education authorities and from the elected representatives. That is why we oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that the trouble with our amendment is that it gave education authorities the whip hand, but the clause gives the Secretary of State the whip hand. The Secretary of State has little contact with education in the various communities in Scotland. Clause 26(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may in respect of any financial year"</p></blockquote>
and so on. Subsection (2) includes the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as may be determined by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulations made by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) mentions the Secretary of State twice. Only subsections (4), (6) and (7) do not mention the Secretary of State as he is also mentioned in subsections (8) and (9).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a central clause. Power, accountability and responsibility have been taken away from local communities and given to the Secretary of State. I do not buy the argument that once one has a school board and a board of management there will be accountability. This is all about giving power to the Secretary of State. Take any school in Scotland. Under the Bill the Secretary of State will be responsible for it. There may be a board of management but arguments about budget will be with the Secretary of State who will allocate funds. At present within any community if there is a problem in a school, be it about the curriculum, finance or anything structural, the regional council, divisional education officer and parents will be there. Such meetings can be arranged quickly, but if the problems arise within that community, which the parents wish to discuss with the Secretary of State, it is highly unlikely that a Secretary of State or Minister will be there every week to discuss it. Even if the Secretary of State knew where some of those schools were, he would not relate to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is bad because of the way in which it centralises power. Conservative Members were most unfair to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) was going on at length. It shows that, not only do they not understand Scottish education or culture, but they do not understand the culture of the Western Isles. Anyone who has been there knows that it is a lilting culture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Its people tend to speak in a slow, deliberate and determined manner, so Conservative Members' remarks were most unfair on my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to debate the clause at some length. Not only is it a centralising measure, but it is vaguely drafted, and that worries us. It gives a Secretary of State fairly large powers, but in a vague manner. For example, subsection (4) contains the vague phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be determined by reference to any amount".</p></blockquote>
Does "reference" mean that it will be exactly the same, a bit above or a bit below? Perhaps it is halved. There must be some other method by which it can be judged. One could refer to 100—half of 100 is 50; twice 100 is 200. It is not the reference that is important, but what is done to the reference. The clause gives a Secretary of State or Minister the power to make references but does not say exactly what they are to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar phrase appears in subsection (5), when it says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"by referrence to any amount so determined as the total amount so recoverable".</p></blockquote>
Again, the reference could be equivalence or it could be doubling or halving. Subsection 5(b) says
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any other case, by reference to any amount estimated by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
What is a Secretary of State doing estimating things when he has 12,000 civil servants at his disposal? I know that the Government estimate the poll tax for various areas, but estimates are political tools and they are always wrong. We are supposed to be discussing financial matters and the Secretary of State should not be making estimates. Part of the reason we are opposed to the clause is that the draconian powers given, once again, to the Secretary of State are based on vague phrases about estimates and references to other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister is well-versed in financial matters, so perhaps he can say what each of those provisions will involve. If he does not and the clause goes through, the problems for the Secretary of State or the Minister will be immense. They will have to decide when a school will receive a grant, when the grant will be clawed back, sort out problems with the board of management and answer queries. They will no longer deal simply with a reasonable, decent education authority, but will all the schools that opt out. If one imagines a ridiculous scenario where every school has opted out, how will the vague phrases in clause 26 enable someone in the Scottish Office to deal with all those points?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every time we ask the Minister a question, he assumes that it is hostile and not just a request for
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
information, but that is the way that the Minister works in Committee. He comes here with tablets of stone that must not change, and does not wish to probe the Bill. The Minister was good enough to answer my previous questions. He should not be so paranoid about the Opposition's questions and assume that they are all hostile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not deal with the vagueness in clause 6. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East spoke about subsection (9) which deals with money going into the Consolidated Fund. I am worried that money which is allocated to the education budget can, because of financial irregularities, be taken back by the Secretary of State. It would be lost in the Consolidated Fund and would never go back into education. That is an important reason why clause 26 should not stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East most ingeniously worked the poll tax into the debate. My knowledge of the poll tax is not as extensive as that of my hon. Friend, but he demonstrated how the poll tax has ramifications on all aspects of Scottish life, especially on education. The various calculations will be an incredible nightmare, because there will be poll tax calculations, regional council negotiations, negotiations over grants and self-governing schools, capital allocations and recurrent expenditure for education. There will also be further clawback not only for various revenue support, but related to education provision within an education authority. There may be a separate division within that education authority and within various self-governing schools. Therefore, clause 26 is a recipe for disaster. It is one of the poorest clauses in the Bill, and is the most vague. I am surprised that the Minister allowed it to be so vague. It gives the Secretary of State tremendous powers to make further regulations—almost carte blanche. It is far too vague and should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not dwell on the role of the education authority. We are worried that the Government seem more interested in listening to groups that have no locus or interest in and no contribution to make to Scottish education, but seem determined to ignore education authorities. The Government are willing to accept that consultation and discussion through regulation will take place, but have embarked on a mission to remove any mention of education authorities from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The influence of the new Right on Scottish education is evident, because we have to plead with the Government for education authorities to be taken seriously. We look forward to another chapter in the report tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
