	<section>
	<div class='title'>FURTHER PROVISION AS REGARDS TEACHERS IN SELF-GOVERNING SCHOOLS.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 70, in page 13, line 19, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Only registered teachers shall be employed, or continue to be employed, as teachers in self-governing schools.'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.—	<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 55, in page 13, line 19, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.</p>
	<p>No. 56, in page 13, line 21, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'subject to such exception or may from time to time be prescribed'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to enlighten the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) as to the relevant terms of section 90 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Subsection (1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may"—</p></blockquote>
I repeat "may" because that wording is reflected in clause 22—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in regulations under section 2 or 74(1) of this Act prescribe that only registered teachers shall be employed or continue to be employed as teachers by education authorities in the educational establishments to which the regulations apply, subject to such exceptions as may from time to time be so prescribed."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will recall the familiar ring of that final phrase from clause 22. In other words, we are merely applying to self-governing schools the same provisions and policies that operate in the maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations prescribe that every teacher employed by an education authority shall be a registered teacher. They also provide that where an education authority is unable to find a person holding qualifications appropriate to the specific post that it is seeking to fill, it may either, with the approval of the Secretary of State, appoint permanently a registered teacher who does not hold the precise qualifications appropriate to that post, or it may make a temporary appointment of a registered teacher and continue the search for someone with the appropriate qualifications. In all cases, however, the person appointed must be a registered teacher. Our intention is to make regulations in precisely those terms for self-governing schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister might ask me to write out section 90100 times so that I knew it by heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was trying to make in my intervention—perhaps ineffectively—was that the 1980 Act spells out the position clearly in about 25 lines, but the Bill has only just over three lines. Unlike subsection (2), there is no reference in subsection (1) to the 1980 Act. If that had been inserted, it would have saved a great deal of heartsearching. Is it possible to amend the clause on Report to bring it into line with section 90 of the Education Act 1980?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how many lines there are in section 90 that the hon. Lady wishes to incorporate in the Bill, but the material that she wishes to insert seems to relate to the transitional arrangements that would have been relevant in legislation where there was a move to bring in appointments of registered teachers. The hon. Lady is asking me to write provisions into the Bill that are not relevant now, although they were of great relevance in 1980.I shall resist the temptation to ask the hon. Lady to write out the section 100 times because she would be learning material that is not relevant to the future: the Bill looks to the future, not to the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of self-governing schools on the appointment of teachers who are registered with the General Teaching Council should be the same as that which applies in education authority schools. The regulations should provide for that. I am happy to give that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Committee on 4 April I said that any regulations under the Bill would be similar rather than identical. I was deliberately cautious because I cannot anticipate the precise drafting at this stage. However, I can say that the regulations will be identical in effect. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also explains the apparent discrepancy that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) suspected as between our notes on clauses and clause 22. The clause is on all fours with the 1980 Act, in allowing a discretion to the Secretary of State. However, the Government have not chosen to exercise their discretion to depart from the employment of only registered teachers. It is this general policy stance that the notes on clauses no doubt reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Summing up, therefor, I want to emphasise that there is nothing sinister about clause 22(1). It is merely an example of sensible and consistent drafting. I therefore hope that Opposition Members will accept my assurances and not press amendments Nos. 55, 56 and 70.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the provisions in self-governing schools will be identical in effect. If that means that only registered teachers will be allowed to be employed in self-governing schools, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment, with one proviso. Clause 22(1) includes the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to such exceptions as may from time to time be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
Will it be possible on Report for the Government to remove that phrase from the Bill? It is entirely unnecessary if the intention is merely to employ registered teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had covered that point in my opening remarks, which the hon. Gentleman may care to study later. I gave examples of cases where a registered teacher who is qualified for a post may not be available. If we took the rigid position that it was not possible under any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
circumstances for a teacher who was not registered to be employed, that might produce an inflexibility, which primary legislation would be required to change and which might be undesirable for good educational reasons, such as the future development of SCOTVEC modules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given an assurance that a uniform principle will apply for the regulations for self-governing and education authority schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of what the Minister has just said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROVISION OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES FOR PUPILS BY EDUCATION AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Eastwood) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 14, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) Where the board management of a self-governing school or the managers of a grant aided or independent school request for the benefit of pupils the use of professional or administrative services provided by an education authority for schools under its management the authority shall not unreasonably refuse to make the services available nor make an unreasonable charge for their use.'.</p></blockquote>
The eagle eyes of hon. Members will have noted a printing error in the first line of the amendment. It should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the board of management of a self-governing school".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Apart from that error, I do not claim that the amendment is technically perfect, but I hope that its purpose is clear.</p></blockquote>
The Bill makes clear the general relationship between an education authority and a self-governing school for such matters as the obligation to provide school transport for pupils. But what about the relationship on specialist services, such as the provision of specialist advisers and in-service training? The grant to a self-governing school will, of course, include an element for such expenditure from the local authority, although the local authority may not easily be able to recoup all of that because of overheads and so on. Common sense suggests that, in practice, and if asked, an education authority would supply such services and charge a reasonable rate for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment aims to provide a broad framework for such agreements. It is in line with the concept of local authorities as institutions that enable services to be provided. I include independent schools within the amendment,—not because there are always problems between education authorities and independent schools in that area; often there are not and the relationship works well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If no provision is included in the Bill to cover the matter, it could cause unnecessary dispute between an education authority and a self-governing school. Therefore, while I do not say that the wording is cast-iron, it would be helpful to the education authority and the boards of self-governing schools if the Bill included a broad plan of what Parliament intends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Ipswich) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment arises out of our debate on clause 7, which dealt with whether schools for children with special needs should be permitted to opt out. During that debate the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs.
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
Ewing) said that such schools required the support of specialist services and back-up, which she said was an important reason why they should not be allowed to opt out. I said that, although that was a fair and significant objection, it was not insuperable and could be overcome if specific provision were made for such specialist services. The amendment provides for the means to be made available, which is why it is excellent, despite the minor drafting defects to which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) pointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for raising this issue, at present, of course, education authorities make available a range of management services to schools, in addition, to the services in respect of pupils which are specifically identified in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 as requiring to be provided. Those pupil-centred services—school hostels and school transport, for instance—are already required by clause 24 to be provided by education authorities for self-governing schools as they are for schools under education authority management. The other types of school-centred services that I have in mind—and that this amendment perhaps intends to address—are payroll, accounting and book-keeping services; personnel management; purchasing of supplies and letting of contracts; advice on buildings and supervision of works; general administrative support and legal advice; the organisation of visiting specialist and supply teachers; the provision of subject specialist advisers; the organisation of curriculum development work across numbers of schools; in-service training of teachers; and other similar services in that general area, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, right that the board of management of a self-governing school should have the power, and the responsibility, to decide for itself what sort of services of this type it needs, and how such services should best be provided. In many cases, I expect that self-governing schools will wish to provide some of those services in-house—for instance, through the appointment of a school bursar—but in other cases it will be appropriate for the board of management to buy in services from outside. The need will vary from service to service, and from school to school. In some instances education authorities will be the obvious suppliers, and the intention of the amendment, as I understand it, is simply to ensure that they do not unreasonably refuse to provide such services to self-governing or independent schools, and that they do not charge excessive fees when they provide the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should emphasise that education authorities have nothing to fear from this amendment. There is no question of education authorities being unable to provide such services. If we look at the matter from another angle, education authorities have been quick to criticise our proposals for self-governing schools on the ground that they would remove from the management of the authority some of the schools that are the natural recipients of those services but, since it will still be necessary to provide them for the authority's own schools, economies of scale and thus efficiency would be lost. I should perhaps say that that argument implies that the provision of those services by education authorities is at present entirely efficient, but I shall not pursue that issue now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
The amendment therefore simply makes explicit that self-governing or independent schools should have reasonable access to education authority services of this type, at a reasonable cost. It implies no privileged position for self-governing schools. It simply provides a safeguard against the possibility—which, I fully accept, Opposition Members will say is remote—of education authorities acting unreasonably in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy for the amendment. However, I must say to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood that, as drafted, it presents problems not only because of the missing word but because it is too restrictive. My hon. Friend has not gone far enough—like my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), he could have extended its horizons. It is too restrictive as it refers to services being requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the benefit of pupils".</p></blockquote>
As I have explained, such services are by and large already covered, in a different way, under clause 24. In addition, I would like to look at the drafting of the amendment again and consider whether technical changes may need to be made, but I am entirely happy, if my hon. Friend will agree to withdraw the amendment, to undertake to come back on Report with a revised amendment along the lines that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be very unhappy if the Minister came back on Report with an amendment that tidied up the technical deficiencies of this amendment because I am opposed in principle to the concept enshrined in it. It provides that not only self-governing schools but independent schools should have access to the education support services provided by an education authority. Independent schools mean private schools that have opted out completely from the state-run system of education. Parents who believed that that system was not good enough for their children wanted to spend their money on a separate system of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private education system has run into trouble in Scotland because of falling rolls. It is no longer financially viable. The Government first dreamed up the assisted places scheme to subsidise private schools, that was not enough, so they introduced tax concessions to subsidise them. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has now dreamed up this amendment to allow those schools to prey on the education authority by obtaining at a cut-rate price services that would cost them dearly on the Government's beloved free market. If schools want to opt out of the state system, they should not receive support from the state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) always tables interesting and seductive amendments. In some respects the prospect of the independent sector going to the education authority for advice and services appeals to me, in a perverted political sense. I do not suggest that the hon. Gentleman wants independent sector provision to move closer to education authority provision, although it would be useful to debate that in the context of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has spoken of the enormous range of services that education authorities provide. The contribution of the hon. Member for Eastwood was paradoxical because much time has been spent attacking education authorities and he now presents an amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
that would provide some of the benefits enjoyed by pupils in education authority sector schools to pupils in the independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us the opportunity to consider how the independent sector interfaces with self-governing schools, and the question of education authorities. I was struck by the comments that were made in some national Sunday newspapers about the problems facing independent schools in England and Wales. It was felt that they may wish to opt in to the sector that is opting out, partly because of curricular problems and partly because of escalating costs. The hon. Gentleman has opened up an interesting vista, and if another amendment is tabled on Report we may have an opportunity to discuss the subject then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to open up vast vistas and do not intend to do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), the purpose of the amendment is not that people should obtain services on the cheap, but that services would be charged for at a reasonable rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman think that education authorities should not be allowed to make a profit from providing services to the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not interpreted my position correctly. I would not be opposed to local authorities making a profit from providing services to the private sector, and the amendment does not exclude that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich made a positive point in relation to special needs services. I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister said about the nature of the amendment. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These important amendments are to a clause that deals with the financial structure of self-governing schools, the consequent relationship with education authority provision and the financial set-up involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two general issues have worried many organisations, especially local authorities, since the introduction of the consultative paper on the Bill. The first is the funding that would be provided to a self-governing school. In discussions in the Committee and elsewhere, assurances have been made that self-governing schools should be no better and no worse off in any financial year than they would have been had they remained within the education authority sector. It is important to debate that generally when we reach clause stand part. These are essentially probing amendments to seek further clarification, guidance and assurance on what that will mean in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial arrangements for England and Wales, which were the subject of a Department of Education and Science paper, raise wider anxieties about how the funding is determined and how self-governing and education authority schools face up to the practical implications of that. We are worried about that general issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second main worry is specifically about the services that education authorities provide at present. Their delivery and financial effectiveness may be fragmented by several schools seeking self-governing status in a particular authority. Specialist advice is available on many areas of the curriculum. Providing a certain sum of money for specialist services in an education authority where schools opt out involves a basic financial problem. If a proportion of funding is given to newly established self-governing schools, despite having lost the cash to cover those specialist services, the authority may be left with a commitment to and staffing for those services that cannot be changed merely because expenditure is earmarked for the opted-out schools. The amendments try to deal with those broad and with more specific areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 210 is a simple probing amendment. It seeks to discover whether there is a genuine commitment to ensuring that the funding remains much the same. On the face of it, that could be the intention and reality of clause 25. It covers recurrent grant, capital grants and special purpose grants. Local government expenditure is immensely complex, as those with local government experience know. The uncertainty about this issue is the result of that complexity. Although we may have political differences on many issues, we must ensure that the local authority is not at a significant disadvantage after the mechanics and practicalities of the formula are worked out. Therefore, amendment No. 210 seeks to examine the general question of funding and to obtain on record the Minister's comments on the balance between the new sector and the existing education authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that some services are, in terms of economy of scale, cost-effective for education authorities to provide, whether the authorities are small, or large like Strathclyde. That emerges in amendment No. 211. But there is a fundamental problem with the allocation of the wide range of services. The Member indentified many of them in his response to the hon. Member for Eastwood during our discussions on clause 24. We are worried that, unless the Scottish Office and the Government get it right, we may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
helping the opted-out sector. I am sure that the Minister does not want the education authorities to be undermined by the range of their provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier I gave a specific example of specialist services. Let us now take the example of a maths adviser in my own authority of Fife. If we use the simple concept of removing 10 per cent, of funding from the equation because some schools opt out, the authority will be faced with the dilemma of funding that person with reduced income, or changing the structure to dispense with him, or to amalgamate or rationalise in that area. That is an extreme example of education authority concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood help with that problem? It would be possible to fund the maths advisor by selling his services to a self-governing school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, but it would add to the complexity of the matter. An opted-out school will have the opportunity to buy in services required for the children's education, but they will not necessarily be bought from the education authority. That is part of the Government's thinking, and I accept that that was the principle behind the amendment. In the example that the Minister used, the school could purchase services elsewhere so the dilemma would still remain with the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem relates to the initial allocation of funding and the formulas on which it is based. In the stand part debate we could consider the interesting paper produced by the Department of Education and Science which took at least two or three attempts to prepare—partly because of its complexity and partly because of the realisation that the problem of finance could not be treated lightly. In addition to the example of the maths advisor, there is another problem. It the education authority decides to retain a powerful bank of advisory services, they will still require funding even though some money will be reallocated through a formula to an opted-out school. Therefore, the education authority may have to increase the level of the poll tax. It will be the same as with any other increase in expenditure. It is the Government's wish that expenditure above what the Government deem necessary will require an increase in the poll tax. That will look more significant to the public than it did under the rating structure, which took income from domestic and non-domestic ratepayers. In addition, non-domestic rates will be pegged according to another formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities have genuine concerns about the financial structure. I have tried briefly to highlight some of them. I hope that the Minister will clarify the issue and strengthen the commitments that have been made. I also wish to be assured that when the matters are being worked out, there will be detailed consultations between the Scottish Office and eduction authority financial advisers. The problems must not be left hanging. Even though there is provision for the recovery of payments made, that seems a messy procedure to me. I hope that the Minister will consider these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone involved in local government finance will know how complex it is. Each department's budget needs painstaking line-by-line scrutiny. That brings some questions to mind regarding the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
clause, and we wish to explore intensively the Government's ideas on how they will cope with the complexities. I assume that they want to be fair to both opted-out schools and eductions authority schools, but that may be a large assumption to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can be certain that the Minister does not intend to give opted-out schools less funding than the education authority schools. How can we be sure that the impact of the legislation will not be that they end up being better funded than the education authority schools and thereby more attractive to parents, because parents will see a financial benefit in choosing that school rather than an education authority school? We need to know whether the Government intend that each type of school will have equal advantage in funding under the Secretary of State's control. If that is the intention—to be fair to the Minister, he implied earlier that it was—I would have thought that words to that effect would have been included in the Bill. It is interesting to see that no such words are included in this important clause, which deals with finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an opted-out school bought all its services from the local authority—even ignoring the possibility that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) mentioned of it buying some services outside—complexities still arise. Our amendments would deal with the problem of ensuring that all the education authority benefits that went to that school were accounted for in full. It is fairly easy to determine how much of the time of a maths advisor goes to a school, but other services are not nearly so easily apportionable, and we wonder how a fair scheme of financing would be worked out for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose a school went to the education authority for maintenance and repair problems. We are not talking simply about the time of individual joiners, electricians and so on in that school; we are talking about back-up services within the local authority, which runs and organise the departments that provide those services. Another example might be personnel services. We have heard about how the school board of management would be responsible for its own disciplinary matters but it might—very sensibly—seek advice about a problem from the personnel department of the local authority before it proceeded. Again, money is spent providing such a service. What about purchases? Any education authority must spend millions of pounds buying school books, jotters, pens and so on. Will the schools buy in from the local authority, and if so, how will recognition of the back-up services that relate to that be made? One can go on. A school might require the local district council parks department to maintain its grass and trees. We do not know how the Minister proposes to ensure that account is taken of such matters when deciding the amount of finance that will be made available to an opted-out school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure, it is always possible for accountants to describe as capital what had formerly been called revenue and vice versa. Over the years, the Scottish Office has drastically cut the cash given to local authorities, and an entertaining battle of wits has developed between the local authorities and the Scottish Office over extracting the best possible deal for the local authority. Accountants who were well equipped in the game of creative accountancy were highly valued on both sides of that dispute. We all know that there are possibilities. Some of them are simple and straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
For example, is a painting contract to be called capital or revenue? It could be argued that on a vast scale, it would have to come under capital. However, on a small scale, common sense would dictate that it came under revenue. One would not paint a door another colour one day, and call it capital. However, a vast painting contract might well be called capital. Is the repair of the roof, capital or revenue? Do a few tiles need replacing or is it an entire re-roofing job? At what stage does it become capital or revenue for the purposes of that part of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister propose to ensure, when he makes decisions about grant regulations for capital grants and for special purpose grants that take account of revenue needs, that he will take account of all those problems? I do not believe that he can do it or that he will try to do it. He will probably think of a figure and then justify it, because that has been the history of the Scottish Office's relations with local authorities. The Scottish Office would dream up complex formulae to persuade people to believe that all local authorities were being dealt with fairly. At the end of the day, I am sure that sizeable grants will be given to opted-out schools with all sorts of complex reasoning to justify them. I will be surprised if the Government allocate grants in the fair way that I have outlined. How does the Minister intend to be fair to the two sectors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I restate the cardinal principle that an individual self-governing school should be neither better nor worse off than it could reasonably have expected if it had remained under local authority management. That phrase has been used many times in Committee and was contained in the descriptive paper that we issued in December, and discussed in response to points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal is that self-governing schools will remain in the public sector. Therefore, it is right that they should be treated no better and no worse than would be expected for equivalent schools managed by the education authority for the same area. To that extent I am sympathetic to the intentions of amendments Nos. 210 and 212. However, amendment No. 210 is drafted in vague terms. It states that the amount of recurrent grant will be comparable to provision made for schools still under education authority management but gives no guidance as to how the comparison should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept that the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has tabled amendments to probe and raise the question asked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). The questions that I would have raised on the amendment, she has directed back to me. They include such questions as: what does "comparable" mean? By what criteria would comparisons be made? To what schools would the comparisons relate—to all schools, or simply to those with similar characteristics to the self-governing school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we shall have to answer some of those questions when we draft the grant regulations, but it will not help anyone in that process to insert general words in statute. Therefore, while I am happy to reiterate my assurance about the basis on which schools will be funded, I cannot accept amendment No. 210.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that amendment No. 212 has much the same intention as amendment No. 210, but in respect of the definition of capital expenditure to be set out in the grant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
regulations. We intend that bids for capital expenditure at self-governing schools should be treated on the same priorities and criteria as similar expenditure at local authority schools, so the problem with the painted door is as much a problem in determining what is and what is not capital for local authority-run schools as it would be for self-governing schools. There are long-established ways to deal with that problem. There are always difficult cases, but I am confident that within the local authorities and within the Scottish Office, people are wise enough and long enough in the tooth to resolve those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 212 is too imprecise in its effect. The definition of capital that applies to local authorities under local government legislation says little more than that capital means whatever goes into a capital account. It leaves virtually everything to the local authority and its auditors, so we cannot accept amendment No. 212.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.51 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I tell the Committee how we propose to take matters forward. We envisage a round of consultation on the principles that will lie behind the grant regulations. Draft regulations will then be issued for consultation to local authority and other interests. In that way we can ensure that all points of view will be fully taken into account before the regulations are finally made, that is the same procedure as has been adopted south of the border by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who issued a policy consultation paper on the financial arrangements for grant-maintained schools in March. It is right that the detailed requirements should be set out in regulations rather than appearing in the Bill. Neither amendment No. 210 or amendment No. 212 is satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 211 sets out some of the criteria that the Secretary of State may be expected to take into account in calculating the amount of recurrent grant payable. My right hon. and learned Friend's consideration will, however, have to go much wider than the items set out in the amendment, and it would not be right to specify particular considerations in the way contemplated by the amendment. The main intention of the amendment, as I understand it, is contained in the final words, which would require the Secretary of State not to disadvantage an education authority school against a self-governing school. I find that opaque. The calculation of recurrent grant for a particular self-governing school will have no direct consequences for any particular education authority school in the area. Opposition Members expressed the fear that the existence of self-governing schools will increase education authority costs. That is ill-founded and shows a lack of confidence in the management abilities of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not lack confidence in the management ability of education authorities. We lack confidence in the Minister's decision-making abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that in many cases education authority services for the benefit of pupils, such as school hostels or school transport, will also be available to self-governing schools, and opting-out will therefore have no effect on this area. There are, of course, other services, such as advisorate services or in-service training of teachers, which education authorities now provide for their
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
own schools but in respect of which self-governing schools will be free to make their own arrangements. One possibility is, of course, that the education authority could supply these services to self-governing schools in its area on a repayment basis, and I would have thought that efficient education authorities would be able to persuade self-governing schools that the authority should supply the services in question. Even if, for one reason or another, that is not the case, education authorities should be perfectly used to variations in demand for their services and should be able to respond flexibly to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concerns expressed are unlikely to give rise to insuperable difficulties. Therefore, I must ask the Committee to reject all three amendments in this group. I take the opportunity to reiterate our determination that the financial arrangements for self-governing schools should be on all fours with those now available to the education authority schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister criticised the amendments for being vague and offering no guidance. It is because the Bill is vague and offers no guidance on how the Secretary of State will arrive at the figures for the funding of the two sectors that the amendments were tabled in the first place. The Minister may argue that it would not be right to write detailed changes into the Bill, but he should have given the Committee a detailed explanation of his proposals to ensure fair funding between the two sectors. He said only that there would, in principle, be consultations about the regulations and that draft regulations would then be the subject of consultation with the education authorities before final decisions were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for Members of the Committee to be told that the Minister will have early consultations with both sectors. We know that the Minister is renowned in Scotland for the way in which he ignores the consultative exercises that the Scottish Education Department and the Scottish Home and Health Department become involved in from time to time. The Minister's mind is made up long before any consultation and is never altered by any consultation. He will go ahead and do his own thing. We know that, so I am not comforted by his assurances that he will consult before introducing the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly worried about the recurrent grant and whether the Minister will make sure that the funding tbat is made available to self-governing schools does not discriminate in their favour against those schools that remain inside the education authority. The recurrent grant has not only to pay for the staff who work in schools and for the heating, the lighting, the books, the equipment and so on. It has to pay for a whole range of educational support services that are normally provided through the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last debate, the Minister referred to that range of support services and spoke of the payroll and accounting services, book-keeping, legal advice, in-service training, curriculum development, subject advisers and so on. At present, an education authority's recurrent grant is supposed to pay for all those services. If schools in Scotland opt out, the education authorities' grants will be cut by the sum of the grants that are awarded to self-governing schools, so that the financial base on which the local authority schools try to pay for those services will be reduced. We must make sure that self-governing schools make their fair contribution to the cost of services. The Minister must say precisely how he will apportion costs of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
the educational support services between the education authority and the self-governing schools. The Minister must stand by the fundamental principle that if he cuts the education authority's grant and re-allocates it to the boards of management of self-governing schools, those schools will have to continue to pay their fair share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that that will happen. The Minister went on to argue that it would be for the board of management to decide where it purchased such services. It does not necessarily have to go back to the education authority for them—it can seek them in the private sector. The Minister suggested that boards of management may wish to appoint bursars to look after such matters; they may wish to take advice from someone in the private sector; they may seek their own solicitors, rather than use the one from the education authority. Some self-governing schools may decide to go the whole hog and continue to take the whole package from the education authority. My apologies, Mr. Hogg. That was an unfortunate term to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Minister discriminate between the different schools? The ability of education authorities to sustain such services depends upon the grant that they receive from the Minister. That grant is to be cut when self-governing schools break away from the education authority. How can the education authority maintain its services when the grant is cut, particularly if the self-governing schools use part of the grant to buy educational support services from the private sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister, all along, has seen this as a back-door means of privatising educational support services in Scotland. He wants the self-governing schools to be able to do that. He does not care what the effect will be on the schools left in education authority control. From the word go, he has never cared about those schools. His obsession throughout the proceedings on the Bill has been to improve the position of self-governing schools and to give them every possible advantage over education authority schools. That is why we shall press the amendment to a Division. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Members of the Committee may not decide among themselves who will be called. I call Mr. McFall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dumbarton) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being hesitant in rising, Mr. Hogg. I was at the Russian embassy earlier, not because of the speech made by the honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), although I was sorely tempted but because an 85-year old constituent has painted a lovely picture of Mrs. Raisa Gorbachev and wanted nothing less than for me to deliver it to the embassy in person. That was arranged through the good offices of the Foreign Office and I walked there and back. I apologise, Mr. Hogg, for my confused state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the Minister earlier that finance is the key to the whole exercise. A local authority will be obliged to raise revenue from poll tax to pay for schools over which it will have no control, for which it will not be accountable, and which may damage its own schools by attracting the best pupils. That is the most bizarre example of taxation without representation since the Boston Tea Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unknown factors in the Bill are the Secretary of State's use of the power to make capital and special grants. We tried unsuccessfully to tease the details out of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
Minister during the first few hours of the Committee. If he is going to be honest, he must tell the Committee how these powers will be used to make capital and special grants. There have been articles on the rewards of opting out. One appeared in the November 1988 edition of 	<i>Education,</i> which mentioned capital expenditure and the cost of central administration and organisation of services. As my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, schools tht opt out will not be obliged to use those services. They may operate at the margin of costs because they may obtain those services elsewhere, but education authorities with services such as careers advice, and so on will have high overheads with a diminishing pool to which to offer those services. The opted-out schools may do well, but authorities will be left with the problem of redundancies and so on. That must come into their equation if the Minister has his way with the financial aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was stated that because of the way in which the Secretary of State will use his powers to provide opted-out schools with finance, a 1,000-pupil school may be approximately £400,000 per annum better off by opting out. That is almost half a million pounds, and is a considerable sum. The Minister must give the Committee the nitty gritty of the financial arrangements. Otherwise, we shall assume that the powers will be used in every way possible to make schools and parents believe that the most attractive proportion is to opt out because the pupils will be better looked after and the school will have more resources for books, equipment and so on. Parents will respond to that attractive proposition, which the Minister will have invented with the use of finance. It is pointless for him to say that all schools will be treated on the same basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the honourable Member would explain how opted-out schools will be better off by £400,000 or £500,000. How did he calculate that figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At present, the Minister should give us more detail about the financial powers that will be given to opted-out schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to accede to the request of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) before receiving his letter, I should not do justice to his argument. It is important to consult on the regulations before those are laid. We do not wish to be precluded from reaching firm conclusions and there will be great interest in those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East referred to the levels of educational support services. The implication of his argument is that the level of services that are run by education authorities is always fixed. That cannot be right, as the level should relate to demand and needs. They ought to be able to market their services, which should be provided efficiently, with schools queuing up to buy them. If they are not, there must be something wrong with the system and all schools, including non-self-governing schools, would benefit from the sort of shake-up that we heard about in Strathclyde. That is very much a reflection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>859</span>
on the far-sightedness of that authority in recognising that the effect of the Bill will be fundamental. The administrative and support services must justify not only their costs, but the quality of their service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an education authority were unable to sustain the level of educational support services that it had previously because of reduced grant, would the Minister give it additional grant so that it could maintain its services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not. If schools go for self-governing status, that implies that they see benefit in that. It also implies that the education authority is unable to provide the services that such schools wish to buy because the services are unattractive to them. I do not see why the taxpayer should be asked to make additional provision to rescue such an authority, but I do not believe that that will happen. I believe that education authorities will respond to the challenge and provide services of such a quality and price that it will justify their continuing to operate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 214, in page 15, line 44, leave out 'at any time' and insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 213 refers to the funding for self-governing schools, which is under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland. There are various ways in which schools can be funded, such as through recurrent grant, capital grant and special purpose grants. It is clear that all those grants are under the sole control of the Secretary of State for Scotland and not decided jointly with the education authorities. There is no question of joint decisions about what the level of grant should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities are required to supply information to the Secretary of State for Scotland to allow him to reach his decision, but they will have no input or influence on that decision. He will decide what the level of grant should be. He even has the power to define by regulations what will constitute capital expenditure, a special purpose grant, a recurrent grant and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister assures us that there will be a consultation process but, as I said earlier, that is irrelevant because neither the Secretary of State for Scotland nor the Minister listen to what people say to them. If they did, there would be no poll tax or a Housing (Scotland) Act 1988. Scotland does not want such legislation, but it is imposed on us without our approval. It will be the same in respect of the provisions for grants to the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
The Secretary of State will decide through regulations the timing of the payments, he can decide for himself the manner in which the grants will be made to self governing schools. For example, it may take some time to work out precisely the amount of a recurrent grant for one self-governing school and whether it would be the same as it would have been under the control of a local education authority. Rather than wait for that to be worked out the Secretary of State may decide, through regulation, to pay an estimated amount. If it turns out that the school was overpaid, the Secretary of State can decide how and when he will recover the overpayment. Clause 25 provides the Secretary of State with enormous powers over grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Conservative Members were praising strathclyde, they said time after time that budgets should be devolved to the boards of managements, so that they could decide how the money was spent. The clause also gives the Secretary of State power to impose requirements on the boards of management on the money that may be paid to them, whether through recurrent grants, capital grants or special purpose grants. The amendment was suggested by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. It is a probing amendment to find out from the Minister the exact nature of the retrospective variation under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to remove the possibility of retrospective variation of the conditions imposed in die schools by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Scottish Parent Teacher Council says that he should not be able to impose retrospectively extra requirements or vary requirements that are associated with payments. All requirements must be agreed with the board of management in advance of the payment. That seems fair, and I should be interested to hear the Minister cite concrete examples of the additional requirements that the Secretary of State may impose on boards of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If requirements are to be imposed, it is only fair that they are imposed at the time of the payment, so that boards of management are aware of their requirements. The Secretary of State cannot give them a grant, allow them to spend it and, six months later, impose a further requirement on them. He should not be able to say to boards, "You have not been following a certain requirement for the past six months because I did not tell you about it at the time. However, now I am telling you about it and I am imposing a requirement on you retrospectively." Will the Minister explain the requirements that will be imposed on boards of managements? how can he justify that provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the intention behind the amendment, which is to remove the uncertainty about the requirements that may be imposed by the Secretary of State on payment to the board of management of a self-governing school. However, I cannot accept the amendment. It is always conceivable that, once a payment has been made, circumstances may change, or the Secretary of State may become aware of circumstances in respect of a self-governing school of which he was previously unaware. The Secretary of State might then wish to impose a requirement on the payment which he had already made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally possible that circumstances may change in such a way as to lead the Secretary of State to alter or waive a requirement that he had imposed before the payment of grant. I do not expect that it will often be necessary for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
requirements to be changed in that way, but the possibility should be available if the Secretary of State is to have the necessary flexibility of response to changing circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be possible for the Secretary of State to impose requirements in a capricious or frivilous manner. Requirements must be imposed in accordance with grant regulations which, of course, are subject to parliamentary approval and must always be reasonable. The Secretary of State is ultimately answerable to Parliament for the public expenditure involved and he should, therefore, be able to control it adequately. In invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Opposition Member would ever accuse the Minister of being capricious or frivilous. We are sure that he is serious about his intentions, but his explanation was too vague and hypothetical for us. In the light of his long experience of making grants to various bodies under certain circumstances, will he give us examples of what he means by circumstances that might change or circumstances of which the Secretary of State might have been unaware? The Minister shakes his head. As we suspected, he has no idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is asking me for specific examples. It is difficult immediately to think of examples, but one could envisage a situation in which a school had received funding on the basis of a set of proposals, and it could be drawn to the Secretary of State's attention that those proposals were not being implemented. He might wish to attach a condition or alter the grant in the light of undertakings that had been given. The requirement would be necessary in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have in mind a special purpose grant for storm damage or vandalism to a school, and the subsequent discovery that the grant was not being used in the way that had been stipulated, or that it had not been taken up? I see the Minister smiling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has characteristically shown the perspicacity that the Committee has grown to know, and rescued merly providing an answer that should satisfy the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting patiently for the Minister to give an explicit account of the requirements that the Secretary of State for Scotland would impose on the board of management in respect of the funding that he provides, but I had to wait for my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) to supply a concren example, with which the Minister agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Minister's point. Funding is provided on the basis that the proposals put forward are accurate. If the Secretary of State for Scotland later and that the proposals had been inaccurate, it would be right for him to alter the funding accordingly and so apply that retrospectively to the point at which the proposals were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government seek to ensure at the public purse cannot be fiddled by boards of management that mislead the Secretary of State for Scotland, that power is necessary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
