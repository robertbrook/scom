	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned at lunchtime I was commenting on one or two of the points made by my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) who has unfortunately been slightly delayed. Perhaps he is sending out congratulatory press releases on the splendid news about Scottish and Newcastle. You will short soon rule me out of order, Mr. Hogg but as my honourable Friend the Minister of State is in the Committee perhaps I could, on behalf of the Committee, congratulate him and the Scottish Office on that success, which was supported by all parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside asked my honourable Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
Minister for assurances on various points. I wholly understand the situation that he is positing. I will not get into the geography of his constituency, but the local authority comprehensive school which I attended was in the small town of Cupar in Fife. It is a market town with a series of villages, where there are feeder schools. My honourable Friend asked what would happen if a school like that opted out and there was selectivity about the intake from the feeder schools. I do not think that parents will ever vote for a completely absurd situation, but even if that did happen, my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State has a right of veto over any unacceptable proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has concentrated on selection. I appreciate that Opposition Members are still tabling amendments to clause 28 which will clarify their position. We look forward to those debates. However, the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) cannot get away with criticising the Government and saying that this is an important debate without spelling out in principle precisely what his party's policy is. He was very dismissive of my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), who quoted from the article in 	<i>The Sunday Times.</i> As I understand it, those words were in quotation marks, and are attributable. They came from the honourable Gentleman's speech at a party conference and were not simply an aside during an interview. They came from a prepared text. The honourable Member is quoted as saying that the Labour party policy is that
	<br><q><p>"if state schools are good enough for Henry McLeish's children, they are good enough for you".</p></q>
The honourable Gentleman is also quoted as saying:
	<br><q><p>"This party is against any idea of selection on the basis of class or race or anything."</p></q>
If the honourable Member for Fife, Central has been misquoted, he has only to say so. I would be the first to agree that the press sometimes gets things wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame the honourable Gentleman for preparing his own speech, but he is not taking the opportunity to say whether the quotations are correct. My honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes and I are left with little alternative but to assume that those quotations repreent Labour party policy. The honourable Member for Fife, Central is not speaking for himself, nor is he quoted as speaking for himself. He is quoted as setting out the considered policy of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explore other aspects of what Opposition Members have said in this important debate. They defend the present system and say that they are opposed to any form of selection. Let me make a general point about the egalitarian nirvana that is supposed to be Scottish school education at present. Opposition Members are wrong to ignore the fact that people buy into the schools that they want in the local authority sector. I see that the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is paying attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I not always pay great attention to every word uttered by the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart)? He speaks an awful lot of sense, mixed in with an awful lot of rubbish, and I have to pay attention to sort out the rubbish from the sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for saying that I talk rubbish as well as sense. Otherwise, the first half of his statement might result in serious reselection problems for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comprehensive system in urban areas is highly selective, on the basis of income. People buy into catchment areas. Does the Labour party suggest that that does not happen? I mentioned the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, because people who can afford to, go into the catchment area for Bearsden academy. That also happens in my constituency. It can create problems. There is a problem over the zoning of primary school Catholic places in Eastwood district. That is a result of the magnet effect of the excellent secondary school, St Ninians. Many families have moved into the area to take advantage of the education provision there. Let us not get away with the myth that there is no selection in Scotland and that there is a uniform comprehensive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only under this Government has an additional choice been made available. The parents' charter gives parents other methods of registering choice than through their financial ability in the housing market. I understood the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden to say that the Labour party now welcomes the parents' charter, but I shall give way if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents' charter has provided a wider choice, and it could be wider yet. I hope to table amendments later which would require local authorities to give parents a range of schools, initially with a choice of preference. Under the present system, parents are allocated to a shcool and then have to exercise their rights of choice under the charter. Those amendments would give a wider and better choice initially, without changing the principles on which choice is given under the charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second general charge that Opposition Members have made against clause 28 is that the idea of diversity is alien to the Scottish education tradition. That is complete nonsense. Honourable Members on both sides of the Committee have had wide-ranging experience of different forms of school education in Scotland and I hope that they have benefited from that. The honourable Member for Glasgow academy and I understand that his deputy, the honourable Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) went to Lord William's grammar school and I do not doubt that he received an excellent education there. Diversity is not new in Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a long tradition of direct grant schools in Scotland. Those are schools with a direct financial relationship to the Scottish Office. Honourable Members are right to suggest that the proposals of my honourable Friend the Minister go against the Scot-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
tish education tradition between 1969 and 1979, but Scotland has a long tradition of different forms of funding relationships and a diversity of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by making some detailed points. I hope that the honourable Member for Fife, Central will clarify in detail where he stands on selection. Does he concede my honourable Friend the Minister's point on music and drama? If so, would he concede that it would be perfectly reasonable for schools to concentrate on particular areas and make a selection of pupils for their specialities without undermining the principle of a cathcment area? That is a reasonable route for self-governing schools to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where does the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) stand on technology academies? Are the Scottish National party and the Labour party wholly opposed to that form of selection? There is a great dispute in Strathclyde on that at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my honourable Friend the Minister will confirm the Government's position and be able to reassure my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside and that he will emphasise that uniformity is not a desirable objective in itself. There is everything to be said for diversity if that is what parents want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that I might have your fore-bearance for a few seconds, Mr. Hoggs, to mention the bid for Scottish and Newcastle, to which the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) referred. We should recognise the outstanding contribution made in that matter by my honourable Friends the Members for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) and for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairmn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the honourable Gentleman has managed to get that on record, I am sure tht he will proceed with the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, and I shall move on from the contribution of my honourable Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central in aborting the takeover bid of Elders IXL to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was perturbed by the contribution of the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) this morning. We have many objections to Members of Parliament representing English constituencies serving on this Committee. They were highlighted by the honourable Gentleman's contribution and particularly by the way in which he tried to introduce a sectarian element into the debate. As he was not educated and brought up in the west of Scotland, he does not quite appreciate what he is playing with, so I suggest that he desist from further attempts to do so. His contribution will be welcomed by neither the Church of Scotland nor the Roman Catholic Church.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a nasty element of twisting my words. In my speech this morning, I simply said that the Government's proposals enabled denomintaional schools to present themselves for parental choice. There are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
Catholic, Methodist, Church of England and Church of Scotland schools. I was merely saying that the diversity—which is presumably the strength of the Scottish education system— would be increased under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the honourable Gentleman displays his ignorance. There are no Church of Scotland schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman highlights the problem that he has on this Committee. 1 warn him again that what he did this morning is known in the west of Scotland as playing the orange card. It is dangerous and those who try to play those cards always get their fingers burnt. I hope that we shall have no more if it from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr Brown) mentioned Church of Scotland schools, but I do not know of any. Does the honourable Gentleman know of any? Are we to presume that he does not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I was trying to make. There are denominational and non-denominational schools. Let us leave it at that. Perhaps the honourable member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) will give his honourable Friend a wee tutorial later on Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Mary hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my honourable Friend moves on to another topic, I wonder whether he read the Tom Shields column in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> this morning. It says that the Scottish Young Conservatives have formed a Rangers supporters' club but have shunned the opportunity to name themselves the
	<br><q><p>"Thatcher Privatised True Blues or True Blue Sons of Malcolm Rifkind".</p></q>
However, do they realise that in Glasgow the traditional way to demonstrate non-sectarian views is to support Partick Thistle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the honourable Gentleman responds, may I say that the Committee's debates would be much truncated if the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> had not appeared this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that you, Mr. Hogg, do not want to publish an article in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) spoke eloquently of the problems that the Bill poses to rural communities in areas such as his constitutency. As he knows, I also have an interest in the Highlands and Islands. Although I accept what the honourable Member for Eastwood said, schools such as Lochaber high, Nicholson Memorial or some schools in his constituency
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
would be unlikely to opt out. however, we cannot discount that possibility. That is the subject of our discussion. The Committee must air the possibility of what might happen if a school like Lochaber high opted out and, through a selection process, restricted access to children from Fort William.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland(Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the honourable Gentleman could explain why he thinks that a group of parents at such a school would wish to vote to change the admission requirements in such a way as to exclude their own children. It is unthinkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The majority of parents might vote to change the characteristics in a way that would exclude a minority within that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable gentleman must recognise that, in his example, there is no other school for children to go to. Therefore, parents would effectively be voting for something that would exclude their own children. That is nonsense. The honourable Gentleman is trying to find a hole in the Bill, but he has produced an absurd example. Why would parents vote against their own interests in such a bizarre way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister will recognise that a majority of parents could vote against the interests of a minority and introduce some form of selection that will exclude the children of that minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does that minority do? I shall give way to the Minister again if he can explain that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I shall do that when I answer the debate, but I was asking the honourable Gentleman to explain why a majority of parents at Lochaber high school—the example that he gave—would seek to put their own childen at risk of not having a place at the school. I note that he has not answered that. He asks what would prevent a majority from excluding a minority. If he defined the minority that he has in mind, we could examine that, but most parents would not simply vote in the interests of their own children; they would take the wider community into account. In that respect, I believe that we may place more trust in them than in education committees, which can take such decisions from a remote centre and without any interest in the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says about what parents will take into consideration, but we must consider all the possibilities. The Minister has accepted that it is possible for a majority of parents to vote against the interests of a minority of parents. What would happen in Lochaber high? Would the children go to Oban or Portree? That is the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman knows what the next stage is. Even if a majority of parents voted for something that would disadvantage the others—he does not define how a minority could get into that position and how those who were voting would know whether they would be a majority or a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
minority—the honourable Gentleman must recognise that their decision would not be binding, and the Secretary of State, who would be under a duty to take account of the wider considerations, would have to approve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Special needs would be a classic example of where there might be a vote to exclude the minority. I accept that the Secretary of State would have a power of veto; I am not sure whether it is appropriate for us to keep leaving all the remarks of "Well, this will happen" or, "maybe that will happen", or, "Well, but." The Minister is telling us to have no fear because parents will not do that, and even if they do, the Secretary of State will not. That is not satisfactory, particularly for the schools mentioned by the right honourable Member for Kincardine and Deeside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to the problem under later amendments, but I ask the Minister to respond in more detail when he winds up. As the honourable Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) said, it is a matter of selection and the views of the parents. There are specific fears about rural schools, and they apply also to Opposition Members. The honourable Member for Hexham spoke of a simple majority of parents. The procedure is not the same as that in a general election. In a general election, if more than half the people do not vote, we cannot just say, "We'll keep the status quo; there'll be no change." A decision has to be made. It is not the same for parents in a school. We shall deal later with the ballot and the number of votes in it, but I think you would accept, Mr. Hogg, that it is not the same as a general election. The honourable Member for Hexham said that it was the same as a general election - I noted it down. Does he want to explain further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the honourable Gentleman, I shall deal with the subject later, rather than now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Always provided that it would be in order to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Eastwood identified one of the problems in the comprehensive system. He is right, someone can buy into a school. That is one of the inadequacies of the system, but just because it is inadequate, we do not then have to adopt this measure. The Bill does not in any way correct the inadequacy; it may make it much worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In my area, I have seen Her Majesty Inspector's report on Boclair academy and it is not necesssary to buy into the area to go to that school. It takes people from Lennoxtown and people have not moved there just to get their children into school. Knightswood is another classic example, well-loved by the Minister, where it is not necessary to buy into the area. I accept the Minister's point about buying, and that is an inadequacy of the system. However, the Bill will not alter that and, if anything, it will make the position worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 deals with selection and what that entails. I remember the days of selection, which took place at the age of 11, for junior secondary and senior secondary schools, and it is a time to which I should not like to return. Children were selected according to what were seen as to the general academic standards of the 11-plus and the class would suddenly be divided. However, it was divided not for clear academic reasons, but on the basis of an exam. Instead of children getting into one bus and going to one school, two queues would form, and that is without the denominational queues, so beloved by the honourable Member for Briggs and Cleethorpes. Children were divided. One group went off classed as failures, and it was difficult to escape from that. The other group went off to the senior secondary. We do not wish to see that again, but clause 28 contains the seeds for a return to selection. That is one of our main objections to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may hve misunderstood the honourable Gentleman's remarks about children being divided.

What is his position on that type of selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another issue. The Minister is keen to throw in red herrings and selection is one of them with which I shall deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knightswood and Douglas academy are close to my constituency, and they select pupils on the basis of musical ability. I also accept that selection takes place on the grounds of age. Children cannot get into senior secondary schools unless they are of the right age. However, there is a big difference between selecting someone on the basis of musical ability and on choosing someone because of his ability in, for example, mathematics. Selection on musical ability will only be offered to a few and it could not be done by every school in Scotland. It will be concentrated in a few years. Is the Minister suggesting that there should be schools that did not teach mathematics, English or geography? I hope that the Minister will not throw in the red herring of classics because there are grey areas that we shall discuss clauses 16 and 28.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make it clear to the honourable Gentleman—perhaps he will receive a tutorial from the honourable Member for Eastwood—that music will always be limited to a very few, and will not be taken by the majority of pupils presenting themselves for their further certificates. That is not the case for subjects such as English, mathematics and science. The Minister mentioned classics. I admit that there might be some grey areas because of small numbers. In Greenock, classics had to be concentrated in one school because not enough pupils wanted to study it to warrant principal and deputy teachers in all the schools. I am sure that the Minister, with his obsession with efficiency, agrees with that use of resources and economy of skills. We must examine what selection means. There is a difference between selection based on musical ability and that based on general academic standards.

We are against clause 28 stand part because we are concerned that priority be given to children from the immediate area. What does that mean? If clause 28 is ordered to stand part, children from the immediate area would lose out because if there is a basis for selection, children can be excluded. Will the Minister give a categorical assurance that children in the immediate zone of a school will always have access to that school? What happens to the child with special needs if a school opts out? If there is a change in the characteristics of a school in the zone in which the pupil lives and provision for special needs is removed, what will happen to him? Will he be excluded from that school? What will happen to single-sex and denominational schools?

The honourable Member for Hexham said that education was about excellence. The report of Her Majesty's Inspectorate on Boclair academy in my constituency said that the academy
	<br><q><p>"satisfied all of the criteria which characterise successful secondary school."</p></q>
It almost repeats the exact words of the honourable Member for Hexham:
	<br><q><p>"It was led with great distinction by a headteacher who had a well rounded and clearly articulated view of secondary education; the ethos and work of the school bore his hallmark."</p></q>
I think that the honourable Gentleman also used the word "ethos". It continues:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horn-castle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one doubts the commitment of Opposition Members to comprehensive education. Many Conservative Members are equally committed to that principle. It is not surprising that Opposition Members have used today's debate to try to convince the Scottish people that the Bill is not about improving standards but about chipping away at the principle of comprehensive education. The Bill does not contain the seed corn of an attempt to destroy the comprehensive system. It is more positive. It sets a standard of excellence which all schools should achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friends the Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) have had some harmless fun by referring to the article in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> about which the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is sensitive. I want to make not a petty party political point, but an important philosophical point. It is contained in another quote from this article. Apparently, the honourable Member for Fife, Central, referring to Scottish education, said:
	<br><q><p>"We remain in the forefront with the best education system anywhere in Europe."</p></q>
He may be justified in saying that. For all I know, he is right. But some people might think that that comment reveals complacency, overconfidence or an unwillingness to try new ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that I am unpopular with Opposition Members. I hesitate to make myself even more unpopular by saying that for a time I attended a French state comprehensive school. I intended to send my daughter to such a school this year. The honourable Member for Fife, Central may believe that we have nothing to learn from the French comprehensive system or the German Hauptschule system, which has been widely applauded for its emphasis on technical education. But I do not have that much confidence in either Scottish or English Education. I am willing to learn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must decide which criteria to use to improve education, that is not a party-political point. Should we go by local government diktat alone, by reports from Her Majesty's inspectors, or should we give parents more choice in setting those standards? I accept that 3 per cent, of Scottish parents and 7 per cent, of English parents send their children to private schools. If we are in the forefront of education anywhere in Europe why do so many people choose to opt out altogether? Why should we restrict choice and a desire for excellence to those who can afford to pay? The main purpose of the Bill is to set such a standard of excellence. The best means of achieving that standard is by giving parents the choice which hitherto has been denied them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some harmless fun has been made of the comment of the honourable Member for Fife, Central that if the system is good enough for his children it should be good enough for ours. I shall not make a point about that being an arrogant statement; the honourable Gentleman must live with it. But there is a serious point behind his comment. How should we set stan-

dards? Standards may be good enough for his children, but not for mine. I may not accept his standards in education any more than I accept his standards in other areas. There is a deep philosophical divide between the two sides of the Committee. I accept that Opposition Members are men of integrity and sincerity who believe that the comprehensive system works best. [Honourable Members: "And women."] I apologise. I hope that Opposition Members will accept that the way in which the comprehensive system has developed has not provided the standard of excellence that we were promised when the education system was reformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have not dealt with the point that we have made time and again, that parents might want choice not only on academic excellence, but on other criteria. I do not want to get involved in arguments about denominational schools. Suffice it to say that although I am a Roman Cathlic, that does not affect my judgment of the education system, except that I believe that if parents choose to send their children to a denominational school, they must have that right. If we can guarantee that right through legislation, we should not turn our back on it. By saying that, one is not stirring up the green card or the orange card.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my honourable Friend is a Catholic, it will not come as a great surprise to the Committee that he might have contemplated, and might still contemplate, sending his children to a Catholic school.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes his point well. Parents have many criteria for choosing the type of education that they want for their children. That might relate to religion. Opposition Members have clearly not yet come to grips with a problem that they must face. They believe that if children excel in sport, music or drama, they should be entitled to a privileged education, but that if they excel in purely academic subjects, they should not. I respect their point of view, but grey areas such as engineering border on the type of special skill required for music and drama.

I do not know what my honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said about schools being good enough for his children, but it is clear that the honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) does not believe that schools in either England or Scotland are good enough for his children because he intends to send his children to schools in France. That reflects the consistent view of Conservative Members, who believe that people should be able to pick and choose education

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman makes a fair point. Because he has more money than most, he can choose the school that his daughter should attend. That is unfair, in relation to most people in the country.

The honourable Gentleman is right that everyone should be able to choose which school would be best for their children. But that is not what the Bill would secure. The kind of choice and diversity for which Conservative Members argue will be at the expense of someone else's choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not every school in Scotland will opt out and not every parent will be able to have the school that he or she chooses for their children. The schools which opt out, especially those in urban areas, will become magnet schools, and may change their characteristics once they have opted out. Those schools may decide that they will concentrate on maths or physics or engineering and that entry to the school will be based on academic ability in those subjects. Parents who make that choice will prevent other parents living in the area from sending their children to that school.

The Bill does not give choice to everyone: it gives choice to some. When they speak about parents having a choice, Conservative Members really mean that some parents will have increased choice at the expense of the majority, who will have less choice because of the Bill. That is what we fear.

The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) dragged in the views of councillors from Scotland. The honourable Gentleman thinks it significant that Councillor Mason, who I assume is a Liberal or Social Democrat, supports the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the honourable Gentleman realises that I am not being critical of the right honourable Gentleman for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and the honourable Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). I fully support their ideas on the Bill and am pleased that they share the Opposition's view of its major flaws. In their opposition to the Bill, they will speak it and vote against it. That greatly enhances their integrity, and I wish that there were more like them on the Government Benches. But if there were, there would be more Conservative Ministers in Scotland than at present. So in a sense, I am speaking against my party's interests. However, it would be in the interests of the parents and children of Scotland if more Conservative Ministers with Scottish constituencies were like the right honourable member for Kincardine and Deeside, because then legislation like this would not be before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable member for Eastwood also came up with the idea that the opt-out clause will enable single-sex schools to be saved from the diktat of Scottish education authorties such as Strathclyde. But who will save single-sex schools from the diktat of a small, narrow elite of parents who, under the provisions of the opt-out clause and clause 28, may be able to secure a change of characteristics from a single-sex to a mixed school, or vice versa?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the framework of the Bill and the fact that only the majority of the votes cast in the ballot will count, which can be unrepresentative of the point of view of the majority of parents in that school, and given that a 17-member board of management can contain up to seven non-elected members, great powers are being given to a small and unrepresentative elite to change the characteristics of the school. I should have thought that the honourable Member for Eastwood and others who are concerned about schools being dictated to by anyone should also be concerned about parents and schools being dictated to by small narrow groups who gain access and control over schools through boards of management. That could happen under the Bill unless it is properly amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not reply in detail to the honourable Gentleman's second point because there are majority voting provisions, but did I understand him to say that he is critical of decisions by education authorities which close single-sex schools on the grounds that they are against the principle of giving that sort of choice to parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman knows that I do not have any detailed knowledge of the case of Our Lady and St Francis. It comes from a different
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
region and I do not represent anyone in that region or anyone affected by that decision of Strathclyde regional council. The elected education authority has a right to set itself a policy which it then pursues, and that authority is accountable to the voters in Strathclyde for that policy. If the people in Strathclyde are critical of the Labour administration policy towards Our Lady and St Francis, they will doubtless use the occasion of next year's regional council elections to reflect that criticism and change the education authority and with it the policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a democratic way to decide things in this country. It is not democratic to interfere in local democracy by using the powers of this House to interfere with the powers of a local education authority, as elected by the ratepayers in Strathclyde which unlike the Government, are not elected by English voters. Scottish education should be dealt with by Scottish regional councils and Scottish education authorities. That is a fundamental point of principle on which the Opposition stand. I only wish some Conservative Minister would share that point of view. They would then be real democrats rathe than the pseudo democrats who shout about democracy from the rooftops but murder democracy with Bills like this which are put through against the wishes of the Scottish people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting speech. The Government is saying that central Government have no right to interfere with decisions taken by education authorities in these matters. He is therefore in principle against the Secretary of State's right to review school closures on denominational grounds and also to reconsider school closures in relation to rural schools. That must be the logic of his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the logic of my position. In the normal constitutional set-up in Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland reflected the balance of support for the Government in Scotland. That used to be the case. Secretaries of State for Scotland at least spoke for Scotland and were recognised as having a remit over Scotland up until recent general elections. The honourable Gentleman knows very well that all the institutions for governing Scotland which this House has developed over the centuries have been rendered invalid by election results in Scotland. No one wishes the present Secretary of State to have the right to interfere in many areas of Scottish life in the way that he does. If the present Secretary of State at least reflected and took account of democratic opinion in Scotland it would be a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the honourable Gentleman agree that it also represents a risk, in that if an exclusive, narrow, particular religious sect whose general views are doubted by the majority and who live in a certain geographical area were given exclusive rights over the characteristics of the school, that may not necessarily be to the benefit of the children educated there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman makes an important point. Many references have been made today to the concept of denominational schools. We are not concerned with the present system but with what it will be after this legislation is implemented. Opportunities will be opened for all sorts of narrow sects to demand separate schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until now, Scotland has escaped the sectarianism that is the daily routine in Northern Ireland, but the Bill will open the potential for schools to say that they want to be Protestant, Catholic or Moslem schools and will not allow any pupils who are not of that denomination. So, instead of our present education system where everyone has access to whichever Scottish school he chooses within reason, dotted across Scotland will be schools that will determine their intake by the colour of the pupil's skin, or by his religious belief. That would be an unhealthy state of affairs for Scottish education, yet that is the risk to which the honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) alluded. Conservative Ministers should consider that prospect seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few Conservatives Back Benchers snipe away at our proceedings, but they will not have to live with the consequences of the legislation. We shall; the Bill will damage the future of Scottish education. Instead of making cheap remarks or having "harmless fun", they should tackle the serious issues in clause 28 and reflect on how it will damage the interests of Scottish children by opening the possibility of sectarian schools in Scotland. No opposition Minister supports that, but seemingly Conservative Ministers are prepared to run the risk of that happening in Scotland.

land. The education committee of the presbytery of Dundee has sent me its comments on the Bill. It stresses this important point:
	<br><q><p>"We are conscious of an obligation to be concerned for the educational welfare of 	<i>all</i> our children, not least those who lack security and support, and so are less able to fend for themselves. We would argue that 	<i>all</i> our children have the right to be educated in a stable, stimulating and well-resourced school, and we cannot see such a right being promoted by this Bill."</p></q>
That education committee recognises the dangers inherent in the Bill. I only wish that Conservative Members who are not familiar with Scotland would listen to such informed opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Catholic Education Commission and the Church of Scotland Education Committee have written to all honourable members. Their letter says:
	<br><q><p>"A major reason for our sadness is that we genuinely fear that the possible results of some of the major changes will be to the disadvantage of the children in the sections of our community already suffering most deprivation."</p></q>
That is exactly what will happen if clause 28 is implemented. Pockets of parents will use the legislation to create selective schools, by whatever standards—it may be on grounds of religion, race or academic ability. They will use clause 28 to prevent others from getting into their schools. Conservative Members will have to live with that, because they will have created such schools without any democratic support in Scotland for the creation of such schools. They are disrupting the education system in which all Opposition parties share a common belief and trust.

I am worried that the Secretary of State for Scotland will decide how many votes are sufficient to allow the changes to take place. Let us examine how he behaved after the previous general election result in Scotland. Some 24 per cent, of the voters voted for the Conservative party in Scotland but only 18 per cent, of the electorate. The Secretary of State thinks that that is a sufficient mandate for him to run the affairs of Scotland in Parliament. If he thinks that 18 per cent, is a sufficient mandate for Tory rule in Scotland, perhaps he will think that 18 per cent, of the parents in the electorate is sufficient to decide that a school should opt out of local authority control and change its characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 is undemocratic because there are no safeguards against minorities changing a school's characteristics and deciding that it should opt out of education authority control. After the majority vote in the ballot, the Secretary of State will make a decision-making process, a small minority could carry the day in the ballot. The Secretary of State, who will make the final decision, is accountable to virtually no one in Scotland. That could have serious implications for everyone in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the characteristics of a school can be changed. For example, the age range that the school caters for can be changed. Most schools in Scotland are divided into primary and secondary schools. Through
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
the ballot procedure, parents might decide that they would like to change the school's characteristics so that it could cater not only for secondary school age range, but for the whole age range from primary school to secondary school. If the school has a special emphasis on physics, maths or engineering, parents might want it to embrace all ranges from primary 1 to sixth year in secondary year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they made such a decision, that would have major implications for schools, parents and children living in the area. Accepting primary school children would have implications for the size of the roll and the type of accommodation. People living close to the school might be disenfranchised because they were unable to send their children to that school as it had changed its characteristics. By becoming all-embracing, accepting primary and secondary levels together, the school might exclude many children in the area. The clause would permit that, and that is reason enough why honourable Members should oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) dealt adequately with the serious problem of children with special education needs. Schools in Dundee have units for visually handicapped and deaf children. Procuring specially-trained teachers to staff those units requires extra expense and commitment. If a school opted out and the cost of maintaining the units fell on the parents of the school, the parents might consider that the education authorities, and not the opted-out schools, should take on the responsibility of maintaining those units. They could then change the characteristics of the school to exclude those special units and throw children out of the school and back onto the education authority. The clause would permit that and anyone interested in children's education should be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disruptive pupils exist in every school. I have taught in many schools and know how damaging their behaviour can be. It is important that schools should not be able to walk away from that problem, as opted-out schools would be under clause 28. An opted-out school could expel disruptive children and throw them back for the education authority to deal with. The policy for expulsion will be decided in the articles of constitution. There will be an appeals procedure, but I understand that the board of management will be the final court of appeal. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman looks at the Bill, he will find that the provision is the same as that which applies under the parents' charter. The ultimate appeal is to the sheriff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be interesting to watch the battles fought in the sheriff court when schools try to walk away from the disruption by saying that they have the right to expel disruptive pupils. It will also be interesting to see whether those cases are fought out according to the powers of the schools in this legislation or to the best way of dealing with disruptive children in schools across education authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of the Bill is the notion that the admissions policy can be changed to reflect academic ability. In trying to deal with that, the Minister went all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
over the place. Initially, he said that ability as a criterion for gaining admission to a school would apply only to dancing or music. Then he widened that to include physics, maths or engineering. Doubtless it could also include arithmetic, history, English and right across the gamut of subjects taught in schools. At one point he said that the Secretary of State for Scotland would not allow academic ability to be a criterion for entrance into any school, but later implied that he would allow exactly that under the Bill, because schools could have an emphasis on mathematics or engineering and admit only children with an aptitude in those subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to single-sex education. Single-sex schools can defend their single sex status or change to become co-educational. That decision will not be made by an education authority accountable to an electorate, but by a narrow group of parents. They are not accountable to the parents who elected them in the same way as councillors are to the electorate, because councillors seek re-election and parents may not. Under the Bill parents can be elected on to a board of management when their children are in the seonid or third year. By the time their term of office finishes, their children have left the school and the parents lose interest. But the damage will have been done—they will have had their way for their own children, and will not care about the consequences for those left at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to denominational schools. The Minister says that the parents' charter applies, but there may be a change in the characteristics of the school. It may become Catholic, Protestant or Moslem. Would it then be possible for that school to refuse admission to children unless they conformed to the denomination of the school? The Minister shakes his head. I am pleased that schools cannot make that demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman makes an important point.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
The Minister also failed to recognise that a Catholic school could decide to denominate itself as Catholic and change the curriculum to include teaching on abortion, which may put off several parents from sending their children to that school. Similarly, Moslem schools could include in the curriculum subjects that would discourage non-Moslem parents from sending their children to that school. That could lead to schools being attended by children of only one denomination, which is undesirable for Scottish education and which is why clause 28 should not be included in the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from clause 28 that before the characteristics of a school can be changed the most exhaustive consultation must take place. But the initial vote takes place before then, on the decision to opt out. Even when that is done, extensive safeguards are built into clause 28. First, there has to be consultations with the local authority. Secondly, a resolution of the school's board of management has to be passed. Then there has to be a ballot of parents and the publication of the proposals, and after that, there is a month in which any person can make representations. At that point, parents of children at primary schools, who may be affected by the decision taken, can intervene and make their views known. After all that, the decision has to be approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Therefore, there is a range of elaborate safeguards against the irresponsible use of the provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State for Scotland refuses to consider the representations, the parent who made them could start proceedings in the courts.

This morning, my right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) pointed out that there was a risk that secondary schools in rural areas, serving a wide range of country, could opt to have their character changed and that that could do special damage because of the area that they serve and the fact that there would be no other schools to take over their role. If I felt that there were such a risk to that type of school, I should be against the Bill. However, I do not think that the risks exists. I know my right honourable Friend's constituency extremely well, and the points that he made were valid. My father fought that constituency twice when it was known as Kincardine and West Aberdeenshire. The fact that he fought it as a Liberal is neither here nor there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State For Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely, defeat followed. My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside made valid points, which apply to other rural areas. It is as important that secondary schools in those areas be preserved and remain open to all. However, the point is that the safeguards in clause 28 would prevent the damage that my right honourable Friend fears. They would be a protection and a safeguard to the parents and children living in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman referred to comprehensive schools in rural areas. Would he apply the same logic to a primary school which might have 10 pupils and 20 parents? What would be the safeguards if parents took the decision, on a very small vote, to take the school out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just the parents' vote—they cannot of themselves achieve a change in the special characteristics of the school. The matter has to go before the Secretary of State for Scotland, after an elaborate process of consultation. So the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) makes, I fear, a bad point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal to be proud of in the Scottish educational system, but it would be wholly wrong to try to preserve it in aspic or in a time warp, because its merit would then be suffocated. The Bill is important, because it provides the opportunity for change, and extra flexibility, choice and diversity, ringed round by the protection that I described earlier, and it could do a great deal to enhance still further the quality of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important for us to argue against clause 28 because it is the core of the Bill. I should like to return the debate to reality, because 800,000 schoolchildren in Scotland are dependent on that. Selection, and the criteria for it, have been mentioned. Nothing in the Bill convinces us that selection will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
not be reintroduced once a school opts out. On the Floor of the House, the Secretary of State said that it would not be, but that is insufficient for us. In a debate of the Scottish Grand Committee last March, the Under Secretary said that he was quite happy to see parents exercise the cheque book in defence or in pursuit, of the education of their children. I put it to him that the cheque book could be used by such parents to challenge the courts on selection. If they set up a selective school, they could have recourse to the sheriff court to obtain a decision in their favour that selection be introduced. The Secretary of State could do nothing about it, because the wording of the Bill is sufficiently loose for that to happen. So selection will return with a vengeance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Howard Glennerster is the professor of social administration at the London School of Economics. I do not know whether he is a wet, a libertarian or whatever, but he certainly made a good point when he said that the creation of the grant-maintained sector is an attack on the equality of opportunity, since the result of having independent schools in competition with the local education authority schools must be that the grant-maintained schools, to improve examination results will become selective in their intake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the local authority will not be able to rationalise its provision. East Sussex local education authority, which is Conservative controlled, recently stated:
	<br><q><p>"The establishment of grant-maintained schools would handicap sensible planning of school places at local level. It also makes more difficult co-operative links between schools, particularly … feeder primary schools"</p></q>
and their secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no interpretation other than that the Bill is a centralising measure. The Secretary of State is the commissar—he will rule under this system. The honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) said that it will be possible to appeal, but every appeal will be to the Secretary of State. His hand will be on the tiller for every decision on Scottish education. Instead of the present diversity of education, and the flexibility of, and community dimension to, our schools, we shall go backwards because one individual—the Secretary of State—will decide how education policy in Scotland is to progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable members have mentioned value for money. On Second Reading I told the Under-Secretary that an example existed in his constituency—McLaren high school. The decision to opt out will be made by a simple majority vote, and parents will not realise what is involved in the long term. McLaren high school is associated with 16 primary schools and its catchment area comprises 400 sq miles. A decision to opt out would, therefore, affect all parents of primary and pre-school children in that area, and that effect would not be limited to the immediate geographical area of the school. The example of McLaren high school shows that there are profound implications for the whole environment. The option has been costed and parents have found that they would not get value for money. Opting-out would mean a huge increase in the range and quantity

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
of administrative duties required, including the administration of a hostel associated with the school, the negotiation of conveyance contracts and the compilation of pay rolls. The estimated cost of additional staff alone is £35,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman studies the Bill, he will find that the provision of hostel accommodation will remain the local authority's responsibility. Therefore, the cost of that would fall on the local authority budget, not on McLaren high school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the honourable Gentleman is interested in McLaren high school—I welcome his interest— perhaps he should comment on the fact that, for several years, the parents of children at that school have been trying to persuade the education authority to mend the hole in the swimming pool. They have received the response that they should not have a swimming pool anyway; schools in the area do not have swimming pools, so why should it be a priority? Such a response may prompt parents to decide that the school should have self-governing status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. Opted-out schools will undoutedly have few problems about swimming pools, but bigger problems will arise. Whatever option is taken, schools will encounter minor problems. The Under-Secretary is concentrating on minutiae.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HMI report on McLaren high school mentioned the need to review accommodation. It said that a mobile classroom were required, Central region had a stockpile of them, and could redeploy them as appropriate. The approximate cost would be £20,000, whereas to purchase one, place it on site and supply electricity, water and heating, would cost £40,000. That is the type of decision that an opted-out school, isolated from the local community, would have to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special needs were also mentioned. McLaren high has specialised provision for a handicapped child. The HMI report said that the school:
	<br><q><p>"had been allocated a specialised lift which connected the floors of the main building, a lift within the new library, ramps at various points in the school and an adattion of a toilet."</p></q>
When I was teaching in a Glasgow school, we examined the possibility of a lift for the disabled children who came to the school. It cost £50,000 or more for just one lift, which would have been totally inadequate for the mobility of disabled children throughout the school. Taking disabled children resulted in extra expenditure. In a climate of strict financial criteria, such issues would be relegated to second, third or fourth place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister say that they would not be relegated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has chosen a school in my constituency, which is a mistake, as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
I know quite a lot about it and he does not. When I last visited the school, I was told by the school council that it had been trying for three years to get a reply from Central regional council to a letter about the changing of a particular Monday that kept being made a holiday. That is the reality of the dialogue between parents and Central regional council. The school boards will change that. Is the honourable gentleman suggesting that decisions about priorities and capital expenditure in a school are made more easily by a remote authority than by a concerned board of managers? He would find it difficult to persuade the parents of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a party political broadcast about the school, for local consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about that honourable Gentlemen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands me. He still has not said whether, in such a financial climate, issues such as special educational needs will get priority. The HMI report stated that all concerned must draw satisfaction from the fact that the handicapped pupil in question
	<br><q><p>"participates in the entire curriculum, enjoys a good relationship with her peers and involves herself in sponsored swims in order to raise money for others similarly disabled."</p></q>
That has to do with the qualitative aspects of education. The report refers to McLaren high school, but it could be any in any constituency in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is asking me to answer the point that the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) raised about the substantial capital expenditure arising because of the recorded number of children with special needs. That will remain the responsibility of the education authority, whether the school is self-govening or not. The education authority will be under a duty to record the needs of children with special needs and to make provision for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we must consider another major issue—the financial resources available to education authorities. If a school opts out, it will get the notional sum from the authority, so there will be deprivation in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had practical experience of teaching in a Glasgow secondary school where the lively art and home economics depts took in blind children from St. Vincent's school and mentally handicapped childen from neighbouring areas. The idea was to teach art to blind children and to involve mentally handicapped children in home economics. That was a qualitative decision; it was not based on financial criteria. If it had been, we would not have seen that innovation. We fear that the Bill will atomise the provision of education resources in Scotland, and nothing that the Minister says can convince us otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that some children will not get into their first choice of school. Strathclyde regional council has been mentioned time and again, mostly in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
derogatory fashion, by the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). But over the past decade, Strathclyde regional council's education policy has been to view the school as a community resource by having the entire community come into the school and join in the classes. If financial criteria prevail in opted-out schools, such classes will be second rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost speechless. The honourable Gentleman keeps making those assertions. I can assume only that he has not read the Bill, because it provides that self-governing schools are under a specific duty to promote the use of their facilities for the wider community. That would include classes of the type that he mentioned. If the honourable Gentleman is serious about this, he should attack the Bill on what it says, not on what he thinks that it says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am serious because I know that financial resources are important. That is the key. That is why we come back to this point time and again, it is no good having platitudes in the Bill that we cannot follow up because financial resources are not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disruptive children and children with emotional difficulties may be dumped into other schools because of this selection criteria. What price will be put on units for such children when the buck rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Simple majority and choice have been discussed. If choice involves parents whose children are about to go to a school, it also involves the education authority. I referred to the ballot box. It takes only a small number of unrepresentative parents to change the character of a school. Unrepresentative parents are particularly important. We should vote against the simple majority provision. It is anti-democratic and the long-term implications will not have been considered by parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of isolation of opted-out schools is also important. Will they receive specialist services from the education authority, careers advice and other resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax—the community charge—is coming in and everyone in the community will pay for local services. That principle will be violated by an opted-out school because it will be funded by direct grant. It is an attack on local accountability for education provision. Local authorities will have to raise revenue through the poll tax to pay for schools over which they will have no control and which may take the best pupils. The education authority will be penalised under clause 28, so it is incumbent upon us to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I said on Thursday that our debate had emphasised a fundamental philosophical disagreement between Opposition Members and Conservative Members. That also applies to our debate today on clause 28. However, I am encouraged that our disagreement starts from a common premise. The principle of choice is reluctantly accepted by Opposition Members and enthusiastically embraced by Conservative Members. The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said:
	<br><q><p>"We accept that the parents' charter is working, and providing choice."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 16 March 1989; c.87]</p></q>
I am sorry that he has nipped out. His comment shows that the arguments for choice are beginning to get through to Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman for Dundee, East said that some parents will have choice at the expense of others. That was the essence of his case and the case being made by the Opposition throughout the debate. I understand that. There is a fear that if a school opts out, it will set a standard of excellence to which parents will gravitate, other schools will perhaps not fare so well and children who cannot get into the opted-out school may receive a lower quality of education. I doubt whether Conservative Members would accept that. We believe that the opted-out schools will raise the standards of all the schools. Nevertheless, I accept the Opposition's point that in exercising their choice, some parents may deprive others of their choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the honourable Gentleman's solution? His solution is to trust in the democratic system of local authority control, whereby the parents' choice will be exercised by their democratically elected councillors. The flaw in that argument is what happens to that minority of parents who do not vote for the councillors who are elected and who endorse an education that the minority of parents do not wish to see. They will find that they have no choice. His solution does not offer parents increased choice. The only choice it offers is the choice through the ballot box every four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have grasped the honourable Gentleman's argument. Our argument is that where choice is limited, there is privilege. That is why we want to extend choice in the widest possible way. In that way, one substantially reduces privilege and creates genuine choice. I agree with his interpretation of Socialist philosophy, but I do not want to pursue that argument too far. I have made my point on the philosophical front.

The essence of the case being made by Labour Members is that parents exercise their choice through the ballot box only at local elections. Those who do not vote for the elected candidates must simply put up with what they are dished out by the majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Choice has always existed in Scottish schools. There is a consensus about Scottish schools across all the political parties in Scotland, except the Conservative party. No one is imposing anything on anyone. Even before the parents' charter, parents had the right to ask to send their children to another school and most education authorities agreed to, and gave them, that opportunity. Rather than increasing choice for parents, the Bill reduces it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that Opposition Ministers who were in the House at the time voted against the parents' charter, so I am not sure where that leaves them. I acknowledge that there is great joy in heaven over the one sinner who repents, so the fact that the Opposition have come round to our side of the argument and have accepted the parents' charter and the concept of choice is to be warmly welcomed.

His argument seems to be that they are on all fours with each other in having a similar choice. How does he square that view with the fact that the elected representatives of the parents will be a minority on the self-governing school boards, whereas the elected representatives of the people in general will control the education authority? In other words, the democratic representatives on an education authority have the final say while the democratic representatives on a self-governing school board are in minority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are debating how best to establish a mechanism that will deliver choice for parents of school children in the best and most practicable manner possible. An interesting article in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday reported that parents have exercised choice by moving out of catchment areas. I have friends who moved 70 miles from one side of London to the other to reside in the catchment area of a school where they wanted to send their children. Parents will go to great lengths to try to circumvent any restrictions that may be imposed on their choice. In essence, the Opposition are repeating the old Socialist argument that if everybody cannot have choice, no one should have choice. Conservative Ministers believe that the Bill proposes an optional system, not a mandatory system, which will provide a better means of giving parental

choice and improving standards of excellence in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill poses a serious threat to the comprehensive system in Scotland, principally because of the reintroduction of academic selection in certain schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have defended the virtues of a simple majority. I wonder where they were in 1979 when a simple majority was not considered good enough to establish a Scottish Assembly. When the Secretary of State refers to the events of 1979, he says that it was not reasonable to push through the legislation about an Assembly in Scotland because the majority was so narrow, and that the fact that so many people were apathetic about the issue demonstrated the argument against such a fundamental constitutional change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right honourable and learned Gentleman will correct me if I wrongly attributed that argument to him, but if that was his approach to the constitutional change under the devolution Bill, why does he not take the same approach towards the fundamental change to Scottish schools that is presented by the move towards opting-out? I submit that, constitutionally, such a move is equivalent to the constitutional changes which were mooted in 1979, and which are still very much abroad today. The argument against devolution advanced frequently by the Secretary of State is that a simple majority is not a good reason to implement changes in the system of Scottish schools. Perhaps the right honourable and learned Gentleman can make a distinction between the two changes, because I cannot do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the Bill is the door that it opens towards academic selection. That is the fundamental reason why I oppose it. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that, at present, education authorities have the potential to change schools' character in the way in which clause 28 provides the potential for self-governing schools to change their character. That is not a good argument for the provisions. In today's climate, it would be unthinable for education authorities to introduce academic selection to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that no education authority has ever exercised that power? Would it not be a good idea if the Secretary of State were to remove it from the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my honourable Friend. An education authority, by its very nature, not only embraces the parents of children in one school, but must strike a balance between the interests of all the schools within its area. That is the key to why a move towards academic selection would be unthinkable for an education authority. Such a move would discriminate against some—probably the majority—of the people whose interests it must represent within its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very size of education authorities today - we can argue whether their size is desirable on other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
grounds - about which the Secretary of State complains, and which he uses as an argument in favour of the Bill, is what helps to prevent any move towards academic selection within an education authority area. Such a move is unthinkable, but with an individual self-governing school under the Bill, it is not only thinkable and possible but inevitable in a number of schools throughout Scotland. As justification for that opinion, I go back to a point that I was making earlier—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Front Bench spokesman refused many times to answer this question the other night. I know that the honourable Gentleman was unable to be with us, but is he telling the Committee that he expects a number of schools to take advantage of self-governing status? What numbers does he expect to do so? He is obviously taking his argument further and suggesting that many schools will make changes in their status after some years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes the point that I was trying to put over. The only reason that I can see for a school to adopt self-governing status is to open the door ultimately, to selection. If the Government closed that door in the Bill, their whole rationale would collapse and the Bill would be pointless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So how many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked how many schools in Scotland I think might move towards academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Brown: No; How many will opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman must understand that I believe that no school would move towards self-governing status under the terms of the Bill unless there was the possibility of the door being opened towrads academic selection. That is the carrot; that is the nub of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned four examples of schools, all of which are relevant to the Bill. I have mentioned them on several occasions, although I appreciate that sometimes the honourable Gentleman may not have been present. In none of those schools does academic selection apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the honourable Gentleman suggested, I was not present when he mentioned those schools. I stick to my argument—in the absence of fear of potential closure, academic selection is the grease that oils the wheels of the Bill. Otherwise—I return to what I said to the honourable Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth)—I cannot see why parents would move towards self-governing status, given that by doing so they would initially place themselves in a minority in making decisions that affect their schools. If the school boards that the Minister has set up put parents in so much better a position, and give them so many extra powers, and if they occupy a controlling position on the boards, I do not see why they would vote themselves into a minori-

ty position. If what parents want is to exercise power as part of a new board of management of a self-governing school, why would they vote themselves into a minority position? Surely what is at the heart of the Bill is not parents exercising power over the schools but an open door to academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the honourable Gentleman.

	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the honourable Gentleman says. It would nullify the point made by Conservative Members, that where such a move was undesirable, the Secretary of State could exercise a veto. He may exercise a veto, but he could not purge the divisions and bitterness caused by the exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents seek greater powers over schools, I cannot fathom the logic of them voting themselves into a minority position on a new board of management. The only carrot for them to do so would be the prospect of academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) I hesitate to get involved in the affairs of other honourable Members' constituencies, but will the honourable Gentleman comment on the row in his constituency over the use of schools on Sunday? I believe that the parents are up in arms against the Western Isles council, but the picture that he paints is one in which the education authority is always in tune with the parents' wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not satisfied that that question is relevant to the amendments and clause before the Committee. I permit the honourable Gentleman to reply to that point, but if he does not wish to do so, I suggest that he continues his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reply because even if the question was out of order, it referred to a school in my constituency. I never said that education authorities were always in tune with the wishes of parents at a particular school. There are many conflicts, and the education authorities are often wrong. In this case, the decision should be left to the school council or board. That does not mean in this case that the parents who feel at odds with the education authority should jump from that frying pan into the fire of a self-governing school run by a board of management on which they would still be in a minority. That would not be a solution to their problem. It cannot be beyond the wit of man to devise a solution that does not involve the sledgehammer of the self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "self-governing" is a misnomer because parents will be a minority on the board of management. It will be government by quango although parents will have elected representatives on the board. They will be quango-governed schools; schools governed by the type of institutions that the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
do not believe should run our national life. They are bodies composed of what the Government contemptuously call the great and the good. The Government are always abolishing quangos, but they now propose that quangos should govern indivdual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The move towards academic selection, which is at the core of the Bill, negates all Conservative Members' talk about choice because academic selection is the antithesis of parental choice. Academic selection effectively excludes some people and is the opposite of any attempt to broaden access, which is what we should all be concerned about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication of the remarks of the honourable Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) was that the Bill genuinely threatens comprehensive education only if it contains the seed corn to undo that system of education in Scotland. We did not think that the Bill contained that seed corn, but it does. The seed corn is the door that is being opened to academic selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office is careful not to rule out the possibility of academic selection in its document, issued in December 1988. Paragraph 12, on page 3, says:
	<br><q><p>"It will not be possible on changing to its new status for a school to introduce a qualifying test or selection on the basis of ability."</p></q>
The key words there are:
	<br><q><p>"on changing to its new status".</p></q>
That deliberately leaves the door open for such a school to introduce in future a qualifying test, or selection on the basis of ability. That is not an oversight or something left over from the status quo—that door has deliberately been left open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister gave assurances about league tables. He said in exasperation:
	<br><q><p>"I do not know how to cope with honourable Ministers who will not accept assurances given in consultative papers which say that there will be no league tables and that the results will be kept confidential."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, col. 699.]</p></q>
I am amazed that he should be amazed that we do not accept such assurances, he cannot expect us to be that naive, if he really wants us to accept his assurances, rather than simply putting his assurances into consultative papers, he should write them into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable gentleman probably misunderstood what I was referring to.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must have been confusing what my honourable friend the Minister for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) asked him.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The school board will receive a report on the overall performance of the school and the levels of attainment of the children.

Secondly, on testing at primary 4 and primary 7, if parents want their children to get into a particular secondary school, the head teacher of the secondary school will ask them for their childen's attainment levels at primary 4 and primary 7.

The Secretary of State has a right of veto; that has benefited in the Committee. The Secretary of State has given an assurance that he would exercise that veto over any school that wished to reintroduce academic selection. At least I understand that is what the Secretary of State meant when he said on Second Reading at column 643–1 [Interruption.] It will not be just within the first few years; the Secretary of State gave a firmer assurance than that. In response to a request from my honourable Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), he said:
	<br><q><p>"I can happily give that assurance. I have no intention of endorsing a proposal that would so change the character of a state school as the return it to the selective system that existed some years ago."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c. 643.]</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises an important philosophical point with practical consequences.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could help. Several Conservative Back-Bench Members have referred to selection for particular subjects.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a good explanation. It is one possible interpretation, which has been made by some Conservative Members.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two answers to that, and I shall give them both in English.

But the Minister is saying that it would be conceivable for parents whose children go to Lochaber high school to change its character so as to exclude other children in that locality. The way that the Minister talks about the prospect leads me to believe that he would have no objection to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is missing the point. It would be perfectly possible for Lochaber high school or the Nicolson Institute to be made selective now. It would require only a decision by the local authority education committee. Neither parents nor the Secretary of State would have to be involved. Under the Bill such a decision would have to have the endorsement of parents and the Secretary of State. The difference is that two hurdles that are not there now would have to be crossed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes back to the statement with which I began: for local education authorities to move towards selection in today's circumstances would be unthinkable because they have a duty and responsibility to all the parents in their area. The board of management of a self-governing school has a responsibility only to the parents whose children happen to be attending the school at that moment. It is easy to imagine how those parents could choose to move towards academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman says that it is unthinkable for a local authority to do that, does he also say that it should be unthinkable for a self-governing school such as the Nicolson Institute to have a selective intake for the teaching of a special subject such as Gaelic, as my right honourable and learned Friend suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister means by a selective intake. If he means that the Nicolson Institute should be able to change its character so as to exclude pupils who could not speak Gaelic, that would indeed be unthinkable. The local education authority has the responsibility to educate every child in its catchment area whether they are Gaelic speakers or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposition is this: if the Nicolson Institute, as a self-governing school, decided that it was important to encourage the Gaelic language and therefore set up a facility to attract children to study Gaelic, selecting them on the basis of their ability to do well in that course, would the honourable Gentleman be against the idea? That is the type of change that would be possible under the provisions before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no problem in adding a capacity to teach in Gaelic, for example, on to a school's existing needs. A school could expand its capacity. But I see a problem in a school setting up such a unit and thereby excluding others from being able to enjoy its facilities. If the Minister is talking about an added element in the school's provision to the community as a whole, we always welcome an enlargement of facilities and greater diversity of provision in any school. But we should not welcome such an element being introduced at the expense of other children in the community who have as great a right to be educated in that school as any other child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is touching on an important principle. He is saying that he would accept a situation in which the Nicolson Institute, while remaining the school for its catchment area, became self-governing, introduced particular facilities for Gaelic-speaking pupils and selected additional pupils able to take advantage of those facilities. Would that be an acceptable proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that it would be reasonable for the school to select. I said that it would be reasonable to provide that facility so that parents who wished their children to avail themselves of it would have that option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wider community interest is also involved because, from what I have heard, the Secretary of State would have no objection if an institute such as the Nicolson wanted to have Gaelic and therefore every pupil at that school had to speak Gaelic. But if a primary school in his own area opted out, became "exclusive" and expected all its pupils to speak Gaelic, would not there be problems when those children went to secondary school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my honourable Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden that there is a difference here, although I am going in the direction of diversity and choice. We favour choice and access, but academic selection is the antithesis of choice. That is obvious. To exclude people on the basis of academic ability is the antithesis of access. The Opposition are in favour of choice and access; Conservative Members are in favour of exclusion and selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do Conservative Members realise that choice has been removed from many Scottish schools because of the cost factor? As the Government over 10 years have cut back money for Scottish schools, they have had to remove subjects from the curriculum when, in the light of falling rolls, they could have provided a wider range of subjects. For example, the teaching of Latin and Greek used to be widespread in Scottish secondary schools and now it is practically non-existent. That is a clear removal of choice—for which this Government are responsible—from which all children could have benefited according to their abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend's remarks are entirely appropriate. But we are making some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
progress. We have discovered that the Secretary of State would endorse selection on the basis of—I am not sure how to pin it down—some notion of the ability to speak Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we now move through the subjects one by one, perhaps we can build up a more complete picture of what the Secretary of State would be prepared to endorse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the honourable Gentleman does so, perhaps he will tell the Committee how he sees the position, because we have established today that his honourable Friends accept that it is entirely appropriate to select children for abilities in music and dance. The honourable Gentleman appeared to accept that it would perhaps be entirely appropriate to select people because they were native Gaelic speakers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman shakes his head. Will he explain the distinction between selecting people who have a particular talent for music and dance and selecting native Gaelic speakers who would benefit from a particular provision in that language? Where is the philosophical divide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not say that I would endorse the exclusion of non-Gaelic-speaking children, for example. That is a parallel, because here we are talking about the exclusion of people of a certain academic ability. Therefore, the parallel with Gaelic must be the exclusion of people who cannot speak Gaelic, and I certainly would not endorse that. The whole point of a school such as the Nicolson is that it has to serve the whole community, and it tries to do that by having as wide a range of provision as possible and by servicing those with an aptitude for gaelic—but not at the expense of those without that aptitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend has accurately hit the point of the Bill - to exclude people from access from schools. Even the parents' charter set out in schedule 3 does not apply because no self-governing school would be obliged to accept a child if the education normally provided by the school is not suited to the age, ability or aptitude of the child. A child could be excluded on the grounds of not being able enough to be admitted to that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the nub of the matter and that is why my honourable friend's parallel with Gaelic is so strong. We are discussing not the exclusion of people because they cannot speak Gaelic, but providing a facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the Under-Secretary of State when we have completed this little jig. The point he made about music and dance is interesting, as is the fact that the Government set that out on the stall but keep the academic ability point hidden. There is a distinction between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was absolutely right when he gave the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
essence of that distinction - that the number of people who may take advantage of having a special aptitude and talent in music and drama are so few that economic efficiency requires that they cannot be provided for in any school. So special schools must be set up to cater efficiently for the few people with that special talent. That is the core of the difference - the difference between ability in music and drama and in general academic ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is making a penetrating philosophical point. He knows the geography and the schools in the Western Isles. Would it not be better if every primary and other school in the Western Isles were able to provide Gaelic for all children, rather than having one school which may wish to take advantage of these provisions and set up a specialist group for those who may be able to afford it or to travel a short distance to attend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in favour of diversity of choice and access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further difference between schools set up to service a talent for music and drama and those that service general academic ability. A talent for music and drama does not usually correspond to social gradations. I have the impression that although academic ability generally corresponds in the early years to social gradations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get the impression that the Minister disbelieves that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to disbelieve that. Perhaps he would explain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman do the following exercise for the benefit for the Committee? At the age of 11 I failed my 11-plus and went to a secondary modern school. At the age of 18, having passed A-levels, I went to the university of York. Will the honourable Gentleman say what social class I was in at the age of 11 and whether my social class had changed by the age of 18?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman's social class is not relevant to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman has just given a perfect argument against academic selection. He has shown what nonsense it was in his case. Presumably, he does not accept the verdict of the 11-plus upon his abilities and intellectual skills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I went to a secondary modern school which delivered me with a grade A in history, a grade B in economics and a grade C in English literature. It got me to the university of York and then to the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. None of those qualifications entitled the honourable Gentleman to make statements that are out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman's point goes against the notion of academic selection. It is clear that many people are stamped with the mark of failure at an early age and in later life they reveal their abilities. The idea of streaming children into the sheep and the goats is why selection is abhorrent to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the honourable Gentleman saying that the nature of intelligence or academic ability is hereditary or environmental? If he is saying that it is hereditary, as he did, what is the point of having comprehensive education when one of its objectives is social engineering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it was neither hereditary nor environmental. I made no great claims to knowledge about the source of intelligence. I said that there was a statistical correlation between academic ability as measured by attainment—for example, entry to higher education—and class background. That is an uncontroversial statistical correlation. It is controversial only in the sense that, having identified it, we should direct our energies towards getting round the problem. Statistically, it is known that the upper and middle classes benefit more from higher education. We should use Parliamentary time to open up access to educations to people from disadvantaged social groups and to people who have been branded as less academically able. The Bill is about academic selection and makes no move towards those aims. In fact, it does the opposite and opens the way to excluding people from those backgrounds from education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman believe that schools whose intake is determined by their catchment area open up choice or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not understand the honourable Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning the Committee discussed selection by academic criteria, by catchment area and so on. Does the honourable Gentleman agree that if the intake of a school is determined by where it is and that children go to that school regardless, that opens doors and widens opportunity and choice? If the answer is yes, will he explain how doors are opened and choice is widened when a child has to go to that school and no other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the honourable Gentleman is referring to the point made this afternoon about catchment areas and the fact that parents use their purchasing power in a roundabout way to move to a place where there is a particular type of school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a comprehensive school in the middle of a deprived inner-city area and a child is identified as academically gifted, will that child deve-

lop more or less rapidly by going to a neighbourhood inner-city comprehensive or to another school outside the area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
