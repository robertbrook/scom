	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 4, line 2, leave out "suitable" and insert "adequate".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you are refreshed after the Easter break, Mr. Hogg, and ready to enjoy the fruits of the Committee, as are we, on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 58 is a fairly straightforward, probing amendment. In section 1(1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, the words "adequate" and "efficient" are used. We are concerned to find out why the word "adequate" has been changed to "suitable". The change may imply a multitude of sins or there may simply have been a change of wording without much thought having been given to it. The Committee would like to hear the Minister's comment on why the wording has changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is right. I recognise the origins of the amendment. Under section 1 of the 1980 Act, education authorities are required to provide adequate and efficient school education for their areas. The point is that the term "adequate" refers to an education authority which has a territorial responsibility to look at its whole area, decide how many school places it needs to provide, and provide them. In relation to a self-governing school, the term cannot have such a clear meaning, and that is why we preferred to use the term "suitable" in the Bill. Unless the honourable Gentleman thinks that there is a new plot, he should look at section 99 of the 1980 Act which defines the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can serve a notice of complaint on the proprietor of an independent school. One of the circumstances is where the school is not providing
	<br><blockquote><p>"efficient and suitable instruction … having regard to the ages and sex of the pupils attending thereat".</p></blockquote>
The word "suitable" is simply a more appropriate term to use in the context of a school rather than an education authority. On that basis, I hope that the honourable Gentleman, having probed, will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister surely cannot conceive that I would think that there was a plot behind any clause in the Bill. We were worried that the change
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
from adequacy to suitability could mean a number of things which, in view of the Minister's comments, we shall not go into. The wording of an Act is important, but unless my honourable Friends wish to add further comments, we shall accept that the changed nature of an opted-out school means that the word "suitable" is more appropriate. However, we would make the point that "adequate" should always be the minimum that children can expect from their schooling, and our concern was that there should be any suggestion that schooling would be less than adequate. If suitability means what the Minister is suggesting, we are happy to accept that. On that basis, I await comment before withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to obstruct the Committee so early in its proceedings, but I wish to explore what the Minister said in a little more depth. In response to my honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) he said that "adequate" had been replaced by "suitable" because the responsibilities of a self-governing school are different from thosle of an education, authority. He specifically said that an education authority had territorial responsibilities. That implies that self-governing schools have no territorial responsibilities for the pupils who live in their immediate catchment areas. That is what worries me about the use of the word "suitable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If self-governing schools are to have no responsibility for providing education for children within their areas and must provide "suitable" education only for their own pupils, they could impose academic criteria on admission to the school and then provide suitable education only for those children who met those academic criteria. Under that definition, a school could say to a pupil living in its immediate area, "I am sorry but the education provided in this school is not suitable for you, and therefore you should not be admitted to this school."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explore that in a little more depth and give absolute guarantees that every child living within the area of a self-governing school has the right to be admitted to that school, irrespective of the criteria laid down for selection by the school's board of management?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked me to give a commitment that every child will be guaranteed a place in a self-governing school. No one could give that commitment because, if the school were full when a child came along, obviously there would be no place for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the difference between "suitable" and "adequate", "suitable" is a far stronger word than "adequate" in terms of standards within the school and opportunities for the pupils. "Suitable" implies that the education provided is appropriate for the child: "adequate" implies that it is sufficient. If the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is worried that self-governing schools may provide a lower standard of education as a result of the use of "suitable" rather than "adequate", his concern is misplaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>279</span>
The emphasis that Labour Members place on the problems of admission requirements in self-governing schools starts from the supposition that the schools will be oversubscribed on day 1 because they will be so popular with the parents. That will happen because they will provide a suitable education, not just in the technical sense of the word but suitable because it meets parents' wishes and aspirations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Minister has not replied to my question. I am not worried about standards; they should be the same as those of any other school in the education authority area. Standards should be the same everywhere: the very highest level of excellence. Nor am I worried that the schools will be oversubscribed. I am worried that the schools' boards of management will be empowered to lay down criteria for admission which may include academic ability. By substituting "suitable" for "adequate", the Minister is leaving an opening for the boards of management to tell pupils who would otherwise qualify for admission, "I am sorry but the type of education available here is not suitable to your needs. You must look elsewhere because this school caters for the academically bright."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to guarantee that "suitable" does not have that implication but means that every school must provide education that is adequate and appropriate for every child who happens to live in the school's immediate catchment area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The board of management of a self-governing school shall manage the school, shall provide suitable and efficient school education at the school."</p></blockquote>
It could not be clearer. It has nothing to do with admission requirements or rules that will operate if the school is oversubscribed. We shall discuss that matter later. The clause simply places a duty on the board of management to ensure that the education that the school provides is suitable to the needs of the children who attend the school. The parents' charter will apply. It gives parents the opportunity to send their child to a school of their choice and that will include self-governing schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister enlarge on another worry? The curriculum in the school might be suitable for children of both sexes and all ages, but it might be inadequate in the sense that resources might be widely stretched over too many pupils and there might be a poor pupil-staff ratio. For example, it might be necessary to cut classes in some subjects to accommodate financial problems. In those circumstances the educational material might be suitable, but in another sense its provision might be inadequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the honourable Lady knows, education authorities have a duty to ensure adequate and efficient education within their area. Therefore, they are free to devote whatever resources they consider appropriate to education. Self-governing schools will be funded on the same basis as education authority
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
schools and their resources will be commensurate with what the authority considers necessary for adequate and efficient education. Self-governing schools will use resources more effectively and efficiently than can education authorities, which run matters from a more remote location. The difficulties that the honourable Lady mentioned will not arise, and I cannot for the life of me see how the substitution of "suitable" for "adequate" relates to the level and provision of resources within a school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that answer. Is he confident that, given that an opted-out school will have the same budget an education authority school of a similar size, no such problems will ever arise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an opted-out school resources might be allocated to one subject at the expense of another. Parents might be anxious about the lack of resources allocated to some subjects and feel that their child' education is not being suitably catered for. What safeguards are there in the Bill to prevent that from happening? Will a self-governing school have total freedom to allocate its resources in any way that it wishes, provided that it teaches the subjects that it is obliged to? Under educational law schools are allowed to exclude some subjects from the curriculum and they might decide to do that. Alternatively, they might allocate resources in a way that some parents would regard as unfortunate. If parents are dissatisfied, what redress will they have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Self-governing schools will be subject to inspection by Her Majesty's inspectorate in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady has illustrated one of the major advantages of the Bill. Self-governing schools will be directly responsible to parents who will be able to bring the board of management to account. At present, parents in Strathclyde are finding it difficult to do that in their dealings with the education authority. Self-governing schools will be more responsive to parental wishes and I am delighted that the honourable Lady holds their views in such high regard. Parents and others will be able to point to clause 7 and the specific duty on the board of management to provide suitable education. If the board of management fails to do that, there are mechanisms later in the Bill to call it into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you can see, Mr. Hogg, my honourable Friends are less tolerant than 1.1 beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74 in page 4, line 15, after 'of, insert 'qualified'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a searching amendment. It is important to ensure that all teachers employed in schools, whether those schools continue in the state system or opt out, are qualified. When I first joined the teaching profession the General Teaching Council had just been mooted. At that stage there was some resistance to its establishment, but it has been broadly recognised that the employment of qualified teachers throughout our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>281</span>
schools has benefited the education system. We are moving towards a fully graduate profession in Scotland and we must put the word "qualified" into the clause. Clause 22 seems to contain a suggestion that we may employ non-registered teachers in certain schools, so I ask the Minister to tell us whether he intends that fully qualified teachers will be employed in all schools in Scotland irrespective of how those schools may be managed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is our policy that self-governing schools, like all schools in the state system, should continue to employ only teachers registered with the General Teaching Council. Self-governing schools will remain part of the public sector and it is appropriate that they should operate under similar regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations which will arise under clause 22(1) will contain terms similar to those which currently apply to public schools under the 1980 Act. Those regulations prescribe that every teacher employed by an education authority shall be a registered teacher. They also provide that where an education authority is unable to find a person holding qualifications appropriate to the specific post which it seeks to fill, it may either, with the approval of the Secretary of State, appoint permanently a registered teacher who does not hold the exact qualifications appropriate to the post, or it may make a temporary appointment of a registered teacher and continue the search for someone with the appropriate qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness, I should tell the honourable Lady that we are at present considering one possibility not only in respect of self-governing schools but in respect of other schools, too. That is the encouragment of parental participation and involvement with school sports teams and other such projects in schools. That matter is under discussion within the Department, and in the context of the amendment it is right to draw the fact to the Committee's attention. Professional footballers, for example, or suitably qualified parents, could become involved with school football teams both in and out of school hours. I do not suppose that that prospect will give rise to much controversy in the Committee or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to be controversial— the Minister has pleaded that I should not be—but—I should like to make a couple of brief comments. First, I am grateful that he has said that registered teachers will continue to be employed. That is vital and will reassure many people working in education that the Government do not intend opted-out schools to be able to vary terms and conditions of employment for teachers according to their whim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued by the suggestion that parents should be involved in sports in schools, not because I have sporting interests but because I did not know that the matter was being discussed. When will the proposals be published? How far do the discussions extend? Qualified teachers and physical educationists are also responsible for presentation work in anatomy, physiology and health and that aspect of PE teachers' work should not be diminished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have asked Raymond Miquel, the chairman of the Scottish Sports Council, to convene a committee comprised of representatives of a number of sporting interests to examine the decline in rugby and soccer teams. There has been a serious decline in schools sport teams and the committee will make recommendations on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also had discussions with the Scottish Football Association about opportunities for extending its training schemes with certificated courses. Although the association is prepared to make professional players available to go into schools and help with training and support, it has encountered difficulties. I agree with the honourable Lady that physical education teachers have an important role. We do not wish to cut across that role, but youngsters of both sexes must be able to become involved in competitive team games. The decline in the provision of sporting facilities inside and outside school hours is a matter of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady asked when we could make an announcement. As soon as Raymond Miquel's committee has reported, we shall consider its recommendations. We shall also continue our discussions with other interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the matter in the context of this debate to assure the honourable Lady and to show how we are progressing. We are sensitive to the anxieties within the teaching profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that response. I hope that he will involve in his discussions the all-party parly sports group for Scotland, which will wish to comment on the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned two sports in which I have not participated, but I shall not call him a male chauvinist. However, I hope that he will also encourage people to consider sports that are regarded more as the domain of women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 4, line 15, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"taking account of any current existing collective agreements entered into by local authorities and organisations of employees."</p></blockquote>
We shall take time over this amendment, because it provides an opportunity to discuss the question of teachers and non-teachers in opted-out schools. Although we shall attempt at all times to stay within the bounds of clause 7, we shall refer to other clauses that contain provisions dealing with teachers' conditions of service and non-teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Hogg, for raising the temperature of the Committee this morning, but we must put on record our appreciation of the work done by teachers and non-teaching staff in Scotland. The Opposition believe that they have been much maligned by the Government. In matters of success, standards, quality and excellence, education
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>283</span>
must of course be a partnership between parents and teachers, but the contribution made by teachers and non-teaching staff must also be acknowledged and valued, because they have done an excellent job. We accept that there are problems, but they can be tackled, morale can be improved and expectations of teachers and non-teaching staff can be fulfilled under the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met many teachers and non-teaching staff. Their morale is low because of the Government's continual attacks on their professional status. They recognise key problems of resources and investment and the crucial need for stability in Scottish education, which the Government are unwilling to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the optimism of the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) on the status of teachers. The amendment is to probe the Government on their long-term aspirations for teachers. The phraseology in clause 22 gives cause for concern. It says, "it may be prescribed" that teachers should be registered. Curiously, paragraph 5.4 of the Government's consultative document issued in December 1988 entitled "Self-Governing Schools: Extending Choice for Scottish Parents" says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Self-governing schools remain part of the state sector of education. As such they will only employ teachers registered with the General Teaching Council."</p></blockquote>
The word "will" in the consultative document has become "may" in the Bill. What is the reasoning behind that change? We would warmly welcome an assurance on the need to retain registration and degree status. Teachers and educationists in Scotland are looking over the border to England where licensed teachers are being created. Parents and teachers in Scotland are worried about what that innovation may lead to if it were transferred to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the honourable Gentleman listened to my reply to the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), but I said categorically that teachers employed by self-governing schools will have to be registered with the General Teaching Council. I do not know why the honourable Gentleman suggests that that may not be the case. Clause 22(1) is a direct copy of section 90(1) of the 1980 Act, so nothing has changed since 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision for self-governing schools is the same as for other schools. The honourable Gentleman's reference to what is happening in England leaves me bemused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The English education system includes the concept of licensed teachers, which we do not have in Scotland .This debate allows us to ask the Minister for an assurance that such a concept will not be introduced into the Scottish education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point of contention is that clause 22 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be prescribed that only registered teachers shall be employed, or continue to be employed".</p></blockquote>
I hate to be pedantic, but the consultative document says
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"they will only employ teachers registered with the General Teaching Council."</p></blockquote>
But the Bill says "may". If I misunderstand the context of the words "will" and "may", I shall stand corrected. Why does clause 22 use the word "may" whereas the consultative document uses "will"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 22(1), which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be prescribed that only registered teachers shall be employed, or continue to be employed, as teachers in self-governing schools, subject to such exceptions as may from time to time be prescribed",</p></blockquote>
is a direct copy of section 90(1) of the 1980 Act. It states that the Secretary of State may make prescriptive regulations. I told the honourable Member for Moray that we shall make such regulations, which will reflect existing circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain sceptical. The wording may be the same as that of other legislation, but in the context of the present debate on English legislation, my honourable Friends will need more reassurance that at the time of transfer only registered teachers will be employed and that in the opted-out school regulations new recruits to the profession will also be covered by the same provisions. We are talking not about a short-term transfer safeguard but about a long-term safeguard for the quality of educational provision in Scotland which, in the main, is the result of the excellence of the teachers and the sifting process that allows both degree status and registered status to be part of the access to Scottish education. As this is a probing amendment we shall look forward to the Minister's future contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response is crucial for the reassurance of the teaching profession in Scotland. There is genuine widespread concern about the English concept of licensed teachers. Can teachers regard the Bill as a cast-iron guarantee or is there a prospect of the Government introducing legislation, either now or later, to change the status of entry into Scottish education? These are substantive issues on which the profession and teachers seek guidance and assurances from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many valuable staff working in schools whose status might not be as secure as that of teachers. I refer again to the consultative document entitled "Self-Governing Schools: Extending Choice for Scottish Parents". Paragraph 5–4 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pay and conditions of service will accord with agreements made in the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee (SJNC)"—</p></blockquote>
that is, in relation to teachers. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For other staff the Board of Management will have to establish appropriate machinery for settling pay and conditions in each school."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that means that non-teaching staff will no longer be covered by nationally negotiated agreements. However, because of the nature of legislation, the Bill does not discuss or specify what that provision might be or explain why or how this overview of the national machinery will be discarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
The debate about non-teaching staff is comparable with that about hospital staff. There is always sympathy for nurses and doctors but ancillary workers, technicians and medics do not engender such public passion and sympathy. I wish to make a plea for technicians, administrative staff, auxiliaries, janitors, school meals helpers and cleaners. They are a valuable part of any team in the education sector and make a major contribution not only to the quality of education provision but to the general quality of life and community access to a school. Clearly, their conditions of service will change dramatically. Opposition Members realise that that is part of a wider privatisation process and the Government have at least been honest enough to admit that in other areas. In this case people who do not enjoy the best conditions and wages will be subject to a board that will have enormous powers to dictate their pay and conditions. The transfer arrangements suggest that non-teaching staff will move over on the basis of their existing pay and conditions, but the Minister must tell us what will happen afterwards under the powers that clause 7 will give to self-governing school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a surprising omjssion from the Government's consultative document — school meals. The English consultative document suggested that school meals are a reasonably important part of the service. I have seen no reference to school meals in the Scottish context. School meals figured in the English discussions and steps were taken to reflect that in the legislation and in the document published afterwards — the Dept of Education and Science circular No. 10/88 of 14 October 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The English legislation sensibly amended the Education Act 1980 to allow children in opted-out schools to continue to receive free school meals if their families were on income support. I cannot find reference to such a provision in the consultative document for Scotland or in the Bill. That may be an oversight, but it is very significant, given that 12,000 people are involved in providing the service and hundreds of thousands of children in Scottish schools benefit from school meals, which they either pay for or, because of their poverty, get free. What will happen to the schools meals service in view of its omission from the documents to which I have referred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are prepared to accept that that omission is merely an oversight, but could it be something else? In England, an opted-out school will have discretion for providing school meals, but it must provide free school meals for those children who satisfy the eligibility criteria. Opted-out schools will also be given part of the recurrent grant to provide for meals at their own discretion, contractually with the education authority or with a private contractor. The English legislation is clear. It is crucial that the Minister assures us that school meals have been catered for and that a solution has been reached, in relation to the clauses on finance, to ensure that opted-out schools provide free school meals privately, or contractually through the education authority . To safeguard the interests of school meals staff, it is important to put that on record and to receive a favourable response from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
The question of staffing can be dismissed by the Government as another example of vested interests. We do not accept that those are vested interests, in the context in which the Government usually attack them. The conditions of service of all staff are vital to the future of Scottish education, especially in a school that decides to opt out, because the circumstances will be different. We expect the standards of provision in an opted-out school to be no lower than those which are provided in an education authority school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is important and we expect that the Government will respond positively to our fears. Although assurances may be given, we shall need cast-iron guarantees to be written into the legislation when we discuss clauses 21,22 and 23 to ensure that our wildest fears will not be confirmed. Staff must have the assurance that regardless of what happens in the future, an opted-out provision will not be a major threat to their welfare, their contribution to education and their present standard of living—and non-teaching staff do not have, by any stretch of the imagination, a high standard of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further issue about contractual obligations and staff. Health and safety in schools is important, and non-teaching as well as teaching staff often do a valuable job in that area. I appreciate that that need not necessarily be covered in legislation, but I expect there to be firm guarantees, on a host of functions such as health and safety, that no decline in standards will.be permitted in any opted-out school as a result of cost-cutting or the transfer of resources from one area of education to another. We expect that the Government will assure us on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To assist the Minister and his advisers on my earlier reference to school meals, schedule 6 provides information about services that the local authority will be asked to provide to schools. Our worry about the school meals service is occasioned because there is no reference to amendments to any Act to take on board school meals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nonsense. Schedule 10(8)(9) transfers the education authority's duty to provide free meals to those entitled to them to the board of management of the self-governing school and they will be financed accordingly. The subject of the honourable Gentleman's amendment was discussed under the English Bill, but our debate is rather different and the Bill clearly provides for the matter under schedule 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, there was no consideration given to the matter in the consultative documents. Although there is a reference in the schedule, we must provide for staff and services and there has to be more than an overture—a paragraph of a schedule. That is why we seek assurances. We hope that in praising educational staff, the Minister's response will include firmer guarantees not only on free school meals but on the school meals service which we regard as being vital to any education service. We know that the Government do not share that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a probing one, and I am sure that in their contributions my honourable Friends will outline further the concerns that I have expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>287</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's reply to the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) when he made the point that it would be open to self-governing schools increasingly to employ people who were not teachers to engage in activities such as sport. That is relevant to what my honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said about clause 22. The word "will" was used in the consultation document but clause 22 states that it "may be prescribed" that only registered teachers are employed as teachers by self-governing schools. I have no doubt that the Minister has that intention, but it leaves open the option of employing non-teachers to become involved in activities that used to be undertaken by teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister probably has in mind the notion that Terry Butcher—who nominated him at the previous parliamentary election—could turn up at schools in Stirling and teach pupils not only about football, as a Rangers player, but about politics in sport. I hope that the Minister does not want to introduce politics into education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the recent successful industrial action carried out by teachers, one of the most important aspects was the boycott of extracurricular activities. The Minister's remarks this morning shows that he is considering ways of getting round future extracurricular boycotts by ensuring that non-registered teachers, who will not be involved in industrial action, are in place to take those activities. That is what the Minister has in mind in mentioning his concern for soccer and other activities in schools. He is not fooling any member of the Committee when he assures us that only registered teachers will be employed in self-governing schools. Only registered teachers will be employed as teachers, but all kinds of people will be employed in self-governing schools so that the monopoly of teachers will be broken and alternative centres will be provided for the Government, should teachers ever decide to take collective action again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment worries me because of the power that it gives the board of management to enter into contracts. Our amendment would say that any contracts into which they enter must take account of the existing collective agreements between local authorities and the trade unions representing the employees of the school. It is an important amendment because, as my honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central pointed out, the board of management will be empowered to establish appropriate machinery for setting pay and conditions in respect of non-teaching staff. That power could undermine seriously the wages and working conditions of janitors, technical, administrative staff, and, most importantly in the context of the Minister's remarks, school meals staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to suggest that the position of school meals staff will vary from school to school. For example, a rural school will no doubt have its own kitchen and school meals staff will make the food for the children. Therefore, under the Bill, those staff members would be automatically transferred to the employ of the board of management from the date of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
incorporation. The same will happen in some urban schools with their own kitchen facilities. However, in urban schools with no kitchen facilities, where the meals are provided centrally and transported to the school, school meals staff will remain under the employ of the education authority. The Minister is saying that there is no new legislation that applies to all school meals staff, but there is a rule that applies to some and not to others, depending on whether the school has an exclusive method of producing food. That is a strange way to legislate—to affect people's wages and conditions on the basis of the historical accident of how the education authority happened to provide school meals in a particular school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the Minister's real idea behind that. Clause 21(3) says that, at the time of incorporation, the wages and conditions of all employees—whether school meals staff or not—will be protected. But that protection does not last for ever; after incorporation, the wages and conditions must be renegotiated with the board of management. The opportunity then arises for the board of management to change me wages and conditions of all kinds of non-teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister would like to see as much privatisation as possible in public provision. The boards of management will ask why they should employ in-house school meals staff, janitors or anyone else to carry out non-teaching activities in the school. Those are not essentially educational matters, so the boards may consider putting them out to tender to private contractors. Will boards of management of self-governing schools be able to do that? If private contractors took over, school meals staff, janitors, administrative staff and anyone else not directly employed as a teacher would suffer a serious decline in wages and working conditions. That is what lies behind the Minister's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I served on the education authority of Tay-side regional council Mrs. Barbara Vaughan was the Conservative convenor of education. She always made a great fuss, saying that she did not see why school meals should be seen as a responsibility of the education authority, as they were not part of the school curriculum. It is hard to take part in the school curriculum when one is hungry, so school meals are important, but the Tories do not see it that way. They consider that school meals have nothing to do with education, and on Tayside council they were keen to take all such activities outside the sphere of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the clause, and clause 22, are all about. Perhaps the Minister will own up to it. Conservatives want the standards of school meals, cleaning and janitorial services to decline because they believe that they are not educational activities and should be put out to private tender. That is not because private contractors would do a better job but because they would do a cheaper job — and no doubt a shoddy one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is vital. The only way to uphold the existing standards of provision in schools is insisting that pay and conditions for those who carry them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>289</span>
out, as well as the standards of the services, are maintained. That can be done only by collective agreements between the employers and the trade unions representing the workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School meals are a vital educational matter. It is not simply that some children depend on school meals as their main source of nutrition: meals affect people's ability to learn. More importantly, the cheaper versions of school meals that private contractors would provide would probably consist of junk food. Everyone involved in education knows that many experts believe that junk food can affect behaviour and discipline in schools. I would abhor any diminution of standards in food provision, in cleanliness or in janatorial facilities in schools, yet that is what the Bill will bring about. The Minister's obsession with privatisation has already been revealed through his discharge of his responsibility for health care. He actively encouraged private contractors to pick up contracts in the health service. No doubt he would like to do the same for the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will change his spots, listen to reason for once and accept the amendment of my honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central. It would be the only safeguard that ordinary individual pupils would have to ensure that school ancillary services were kept at a high standard and not sacrificed on the altar of the Minister's obsession with privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps some information on current wage rates for the jobs that we are discussing would be helpful. Local authority cleaners now get £101.25 for a 39-hour week, which amounts to £2.596 an hour. Assistant janitors get £115.05 for the same hours, which is £2.95 an hour. A primary school janitor gets £119.65 for a 39-hour week, which is £3.07 an hour. A janitor in a secondary school or college earns £124.24 a week, which is £3.19 an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common knowledge that cleaners in the private sector in Scotland get about £1.60 an hour. That works out at £62.40, assuming that cleaners work a 39-hour week. So someone who has worked as a local authority cleaner and who transfers to a private sector firm will have an immense drop in wages of about £40 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of the Committee that considered the Local Government Finance Bill we discussed the enforced privatisation of local authority services. Those services are going out to tender right now in the Strathclyde region. The 	<i>Hansard</i> record shows that Ministers denied that the private sector would necessarily pay lower wages than the public sector, although everyone knew that was nonsense. What can one do when people will not accept the facts? The point of privatisation is to make sure that there will be rich pickings for the firms that want to run cleaning services for education authorities. Strathclyde regional council and other education authorities expect to lose cleaning contracts because they will not reduce wage rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a councillor involved in national wage bargaining on behalf of the employers, councils tried to ensure that all jobs were put on a proper footing by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
carrying out job studies and assessing their true value. Where necessary, pay was improved. That was done in the teeth of bitter opposition from the Dept of Environment and from the Treasury, which tried to do everything they could to force local authorities not to raise wages. To talk about equal rights for women is hypocritical when it has been shown how hollow those claims are. The Government did all that they could to prevent women cleaners getting a decent living wage. Such low-paid women who have been forced to accept a miserable £101 a week will now have to accept £62.50 a week. What does that Minister call that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) has already pointed out that many non-teaching staff receive low wages. Others work voluntarily, which is important in the school's community context, particularly in rural areas, where many facilities are available only in schools. Voluntary help and assistance by non-teaching staff helps immeasurably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister outlines the future of self-governing schools, as he conceives it, and the status of non-teaching staff, I hope that he will acknowledge the tremendous amount of work done by non-teaching staff, often voluntarily. Sometimes volunteers open the school for others who wish to use it for a community function; sometimes they stay on for many hours without accepting any payment. Such services must be appreciated. The Opposition deplore any moves by the Government to put teaching or non-teaching staff on a different footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between saying "it may be prescribed" and it "will" be prescribed. The Minister said that the Government do not intend that non-registered teachers should be used in self-governing schools Why, therefore, does clause 22(1) use the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be prescribed that only registered teachers shall be employed"?</p></blockquote>
The Minister cited the precedent of the 1980 Act. I am not happy with that explanation. Why was the word "may" used in the 1980 Act in preference to the word "will"? What was the rationale? I see no reason why that should be automatically carried over into this Bill. If the Government propose that it will be prescribed that only registered teachers and not non-registered teachers should be used, why do they not write that into the Bill? Why leave the option open? If that is not the Government's intention, such a provision is entirely redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confused by this wording. Clause 22 allows fox exceptions to the general rule. Why weaken the subsection by using the word "may" rather than the word "will"? The fact that it was used earlier is not a good reason to use it again if the Government genuinely intend that non-registered teachers should not be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is clear about school meals. Clause 21(2)(b) provides that meal staff re-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>291</span>
main with the authority unless they provide meals only at the school concerned. Schedule 10(8)(9) transfers the education authority's duties to provide school meals to those entitled to it to the board of management, which will be funded accordingly. So, the matter of school meals has been a red herring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Members for Glasgow, Mary hill (Mrs. Fyfe) and for Dundee, East asked me about competitive tendering. Local authorites are expected to provide their services as efficiently as possible to make more resources available for education. I expect standards to be better than, or at least equal to, those achieved now. Self-governing schools will be able to go out to competitive tender or bring in outside contractors to provide meals. There is nothing wrong with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that £1.60 an hour is a fair wage? If so, will he explain why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Lady believes that it is the function of education authorities, or the health boards that the honourable Member for Dundee, East mentioned, to provide employment on terms that she considers to be appropriate, I disagree with her. It is the function of education authorities to provide adequate and efficient education in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If education authorities are able to provide a school meals service of a given standard at a lower cost than they can now provide, they should take the opportunity. If people are prepared to work on a part-time basis at rates of pay that are freely negotiated in the marketplace, that is a matter for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady differs from me in that she sees the education system as something to be used by her friends in the trade unions to deliver their objectives. I see the system as being about delivering educational objectives for children, and the Bill will ensure that both self-governing and education authority schools will use resources cost-effectively and that the school meals service is of the highest possible standard and represents value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the education system as being partly about teaching decent human values and respect for one another. Therefore, one would not expect one's fellow citizens who provide necessary services to live in poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not prepared to condemn an hourly wage rate of £1.60, will he tell us what rate he would condemn as unsatisfactory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady invites me to stray into areas beyond the bounds of the Committee. However, on living standards and poverty, I point out that the Government have done more than any other to provide benefits and income support. Our reforms of the social security system have channelled money to those in greatest need, such as single parents and families with young children. If someone is in employment and his income is below a reasonable level, the honourable Lady knows that there are arrangements to supplement it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
It is symptomatic of the confusion that ran like a thread through the honourable Lady's speech that she should place emphasis on those issues. The school system is not the social security system and there are arrangements other than school meals for dispensing social security. School meals are provided to ensure that children are given a proper meal while they are at school, and the Bill provides that free school meals will be given by self-governing schools to those children who are entitled to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also makes proper arrangements for teaching staff. The distinction between teaching and non-teaching staff is important because teachers are currently covered by the SJNC arrangements which, as I explained earlier, will apply to self-governing schools. There are no statutory arrangements for non-teaching staff, but boards of management when employing them will have to take account of rates of pay elsewhere—and that includes those in the local authority sector. It is symptomatic that it does not appeal to have occurred to Opposition Members that self-governing schools might find it possible to make do with fewer staff and so pay more. In any case, the boards will make their own arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the board of management would have to take account of wages and conditions elsewhere and specifically mentioned local authorities. If a local authority lays down minimum standards for the provision of school meals when awarding contracts within its control, will they also apply to self-governing schools or will those schools be able to set different standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be open to the board of management to set standards that exceed those of the local authority sector if it wishes. I have already said that it will be closer and more accountable to the parents than local authorities are. In my constituency Central regional council unilaterally closed the kitchen at Doune primary school, which caused immense resentment among parents who did not even receive responses to their letters. There was no meeting with the director of education. A self-governing school will be directly accountable and decisions will be taken by the parents on the board of management. The standards of performance and delivery will be considerably in excess of those in some local authority schools. The point is that parents will determine the standards and the appropriate level of staffing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister explained that someone on a low wage could claim income support. I thank him for enlightening me. He believes in a system of income support for private sector employers who pay low wages. If they get away with paying low wages, the taxpayer must pay for the income support to ensure a decent standard of living for those forced to live on low wages. It is nonsense for the Minister to talk about freely negotiated wages because many people do not have the support of trade union negotiators. Trade unions were formed so that a janitor or cleaner did not have to act on his own. The Minister's disingenuous answer is no less and no better than what I expected from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady is a little confused. The changes to the social security system in response to the arguments about the poverty trap were intended to create incentives to people who accepted employment at low wages. To suggest that there is a cross-subsidy ignores the mechanism for the delivery of income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under competitive tendering many wages are higher than in the public sector. However, I acknowledge that holiday entitlement and sick leave might differ. If the honourable Member for Maryhill regards public service as a system to provide better terms and conditions of employment than those achieved in the private sector, and at the expense of the service being delivered—in this case, education—she and I part company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Few will be fooled by the Minister's comments, especially those who benefit from privatisation in the Health Service.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his speech, the honourable Gentleman mentioned health and safety. The self-governing school has a duty to provide school education for its pupils and a common law duty to provide adequate care, from which follow health and safety responsibilities.

The honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) who has left the Committee room, and the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) asked about the use of the words "may" and "shall". The honourable Member for Fife, Central was satisfied that the word "may" applied in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, but that was not sufficient for the honourable Member for Western Isles who wanted to know why the word "shall" is not used. Even if we substituted the word "shall", that would still leave a completely unfettered power to prescribe exceptions to the regulations which we require and so it would achieve no purpose. The arguments about "may" and "shall" are irrelevant. The Secretary of State will have the power to require that only registered teachers be employed. We gave that undertaking during the debates on the two amendments under discussion this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

registered with the General Teaching Council to be employed are provided through regulations. We have said that the regulations that we shall make will ensure that. If we wished to change that, we should have to change the regulations, which are subject to the House's approval. The issue is not one of adding clauses or making changes. The regulations for self-governing schools in the Bill are the same as those that were provided in the 1980 Act, and that we have used to require that only registered teachers are employed in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister guarantee that in the lifetime of this Parliament no regulation will be used to take away the registration status of teachers transferring, or of new recruits, to an opted-out school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand that question. If the honourable Gentleman is asking me about teachers who transfer to a self-governing school, I must tell him that they will be employed already in the education authority sector and registered with the GTC. Regarding teachers employed subsequently by self-governing schools, I have already given an undertaking that those schools will employ only registered teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That should answer the honourable Gentleman's question. As he is seeking a guarantee about what happens in self-governing schools, he clearly expects some such schools to appear within the lifetime of this Parliament, although he refuses to say how many. If self-governing schools appear in that time, they will have to employ teachers who are registered with the GTC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister obviously believes that the old jokes are the best. I shall make my question more specific. Will the Minister guarantee that, after the Bill is enacted and before the end of this Parliament, the professional status of teachers will not be affected by changes in the regulations that govern registration? It is a simple question. Many teachers will want to know the answer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people will want to know what the question means. The honourable Gentleman talks about changes in the status of teachers in terms of registration. The GTC decides what qualifications are appropriate for registration. It will also decide on any changes that are required. It is currently considering how the impact of 1992 and the changes within Europe will affect its regulations. The honourable Gentleman needs to have a chat with the GTC about its plans in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue, on which the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) concisely focussed the Committee's attention is whether teachers who are employed in self-governing schools will have to meet the same requirement for registration with the GTC as teachers who are employed in local authority schools. I gave her an unequivocal, categorical undertaking that they will have to be registered with the GTC. The honourable Gentleman is now asking me to give the Committee that during the lifetime of this

Parliament, the GTC will not change its requirements for registration. He may think that the Scottish office has great power in such matters, but he is mistaken. The GTC must make its own decisions. Although the Government have the option of making changes in the future, we have no such intention at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was nearly reassured until the Minister's final remark that the Government could make changes in the future but have no intention of doing so. I ask the Minister again for a guarantee that he will not use the powers of regulation which the Bill gives him to change the registration of teachers in Scotland. We are worried not about the GTC's powers to approve qualifications for registration, but about its continuing ability to provide the registration status that all Scottish teachers enjoy. The Bill makes no such provision, and the Minister has conceded that he would have the power to change that status. We want a guarantee to be written into the Bill that he will not use that power in the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the honourable Gentleman means when he calls for a guarantee to be written into the Bill. If he wants the legislation to contain a provision that will make it impossible for the Secretary of State to make regulations, he must table an amendment for discussion by the Committee. I do not think that it would be widely supported. The GTC especially would not favour it. Most people recognise a need for flexibility in primary legislation. I am not aware of any proposals to change the requirements for registration by the GTC, apart from those that pertain to 1992 and the requirements of the European Community. If the GTC presented a good case for change, the Government would support it.

The amendment is once again taken verbatim from one tabled during the debates on the Education Reform Act. Many of the arguments made this morning were considered at length by the Committee considering that legislation, as can be seen in clause 951 of the report on its proceeding. The honourable Member for Fife, Central wants the boards of management of self-governing schools to take account of national collective agreements. There are no such agreements for non-teaching staff. I assume, therefore, that this is a probing rather than a serious amendment. I suggest that the honourable Gentleman does not press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's idealogical froth has surfaced again. In the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 he broke the link between local authorities and education. He now seeks to do the same with pay, conditions and negotiations in this Bill. The School Boards (Scotland) Act provides a potential political battleground for parents and staff, and this Bill will have the same effect on pay and negotiations. The Minister's remarks about competitive tendering are revealing. He says that he will deliver education at the most competitive price, freely negotiated in the market place. That, however, is not the whole equation. The Opposition believe that the Committee must take account of justice and fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
One of my constituents worked as a cleaner for a local firm for 25 years. She was happy in her work, until the firm made private contractors responsible for the cleaning. She had to choose between working double the hours for the same wages and leaving. She had no recourse to a union or to any advice. It was Hobson's choice. The Opposition fear that many such cases will arise in a system of competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there could be differences in conditions of service. Those differences will be detrimental to most people. The Minister has said nothing to convince me otherwise. Boards of management of self-governing schools will be able to set their own conditions of service. That can only be a retrograde step, because we must see our schools as organic entities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) told the Committee that many cleaners in our area are paid £1.60 an hour. Will the Minister consider fairness and justice and say whether he wants a competitive tendering system in which employees are paid less than £1.60 an hour? Can people live adequately—or, to refer to our debate on the previous amendment, live satisfactorily—on such wages? That is the key to our worries, and the Minister has gone no way towards answering them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The Minister said that the Scottish joint negotiating committee on further education will negotiate on behalf of teachers. However, clause 21(3), which deals with staff states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Contract of employment between a person to whom this section applies and the education authority by whom he is employed shall have effect from the incorporation date as if originally made between him and the board of management of the school."</p></blockquote>
That will suffice where teachers in local authority schools transfer to self-governing schools. But what are the implications for conditions of service for staff who join a self-governing school after its incorporation date? The Clause could be as detrimental for teachers' conditions of service as it is for those of non-teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as undermining pay and conditions, the Minister has no regard for the quality of education in self-governing schools. Many factors must be considered when assessing quality, and the Minister is doing education a disservice with this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirmed that self-governing school management boards will be able to put ancillary services, such as school meals, out to tender. That may involve all the staff being sacked and new staff being employed. Clause 21(2)(b) makes it possible for someone working in a self-governing school's meals service to continue to be employed by the education authority rather than the board of management. How would such a person be affected by the management board putting the meals service out to tender and giving it to a company that employed completely new staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is clear for existing staff. There are no statutory agreements for non-teaching staff. The Scottish joint negotiating committee on school education sets national agreements for teachers. Existing staff who transfer from the local authority to the self-governing school would be employed on the same terms and conditions, which could not be changed. The problem arises with non-teaching staff who are not already within the school and who do not transfer from the local authority. The honourable Gentleman's case is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) asked how SJNC terms would apply to staff who join a self-governing school, not having previously transferred across. The discussion paper states that schools must meet SJNC terms as part of the conditions of grant. The honourable Member for Dundee, East looks unhappy, and I shall give way if I have missed a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I was drawing attention to a case that could arise where a self-governing school used somebody employed by the education authority to provide school meals under the terms of clause 21(2)(b). That allows the possibility of there being a person in the school who is employed not by the self-governing school's board of management, but by the education authority. What would happen to such a person if the board of management decided to put the school meals service out to contract? Would he be transferred to another school within the authority, or would he be sacked if a new contractor started to provide school meals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would need to be determined and resolved by the board of management. If the service were put out to competitive tender or the board sought to provide the service in another way, it would be because the board wanted to improve the service or obtain better value for money. In the case referred to by the honourable Gentleman, such a person would already be covered by whatever pay and conditions had been agreed and offered by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his answer. Will contracts of employment of staff who join a school after the incorporation date be different from those drawn up by the board of management for other staff on that date? Does the Minister recognise that that could lead to two different sets of conditions for school staff in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the honourable Gentleman is asking about contracts of employment or pay and conditions. The amendment is not strictly about contracts of employment, but the board of management will enter into whatever contracts of employment it deems appropriate. Differences between individual members of staff may reflect differences in contracts of employment. However, rates of pay are established on a statutory basis through the Scottish joint negotiating committee on further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has said that he intends to preserve the negotiating machinery for teachers, why does such machinery have to be abandoned for cleaners, janitors, school meals staff, auxiliaries and everybody else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not said that negotiating machinery has to be abandoned for them. The honourable Lady said that. My view is that boards of management should decide what they pay their non-teaching staff, while teaching staff will be covered by the Scottish joint negotiating committee which will continue to discuss their terms and conditions. There are no statutory national arrangements for determining the pay of non-teaching staff. I have not argued that existing arrangements should be dismantled; no doubt they will continue for as long as they are found useful. It will be for the boards of management of self-governing schools, in deciding pay and conditions for non-teaching staff, to determine whether they wish to take account of arrangements in the local authority sector, the private sector, or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not have said "disbanding" the negotiating machinery, as that machinery will remain for schools still within local authority control. Schools that opt out will have freedom to decide their own wage rates, so how will low-paid staff be protected? Is the Minister saying that each school will have its own negotiating arrangements and that all opted-out schools will not organise some sort of joint negotiating machinery throughout Scotland? Is he saying that each school will negotiate locally, as it sees fit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Horror of horrors! Schools will be able to decide what they pay cleaners. What is wrong with that? Schools may decide that it is more convenient to organise themselves collectively, or they may decide to take account of national agreements: they can decide what is appropriate for their school. That may result in cleaning ladies being paid more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a downright attempt to mislead the Committee. The Government have yet to quote a single case of anyone being paid more. Does the Minister deny that the average pay for cleaners in the private sector in Scotland is £1.60 an hour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to ask my advisers to investigate the rates of pay for cleaners in the private sector and write to the honourable Lady, although I am not certain that that falls within my responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the average wage, it will be open to a self-governing school to decide that it wants a high standard of cleaning, or a cleaner who also acts as janitor

or carries out other functions. Such a role would not be allowed by some education authorities. Consequently, an opted-out school may pay such a person considerably more .It is not for me, or for the honourable Lady, or for the education authority, to lay down rules to restrict the way in which schools meet such requirements. It will be a feature of self-governing schools that they will want highly motivated staff. No doubt they will devise terms and conditions of employment to ensure that, and they will be free to do so; that is a considerable bonus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said that I was trying to mislead the Committee. It is the honourable Lady who insists that everyone's salary will be reduced. I maintain that self-governing schools will be able to decide what is appropriate. If the board of management is made up of people such as the honourable Lady, cleaning ladies will not be paid £1.60 an hour. If the honourable Lady is representative of her constituents and if schools in her constituency decide to become self-governing, her constituents will be able to deliver the conditions in which she believes. She would welcome that flexibility rather than move amendments that would prevent it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Maryhill said that the average wage for cleaners is £1.60 an hour. A self-governing school could decide to alter pay and conditions and offer cleaners 80p an hour. If a cleaner came to the Minister's surgery saying that she had been employed in a school for 20 years and now that it had become self-governing she was getting only half the wage that she got before, what would he say to her?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made some extraordinary remarks in response to reasonable questions asked on behalf of staff who do a valuable job. We now seem to have the concept of the all-purpose worker. That idea stirred my memory of an Omega report from the Adam Smith Institute—[interruption.] I thought that that would elicit some response from the Conservative Back Benchers, who have been so quiet today. That interesting report reflected, as the Minister has done, on people's commitment to the school. It suggests that after doing a day's teaching, teachers might want to go on to provide the services that used to be provided by non-teaching staff. The all-purpose worker is a new concept in Scottish education, but in opted-out schools teachers, who have a difficult enough job already, may apparently be asked to perform other services for the community. No altruism would be expected, of course. They would probably receive a bonus for a little bit of extra cleaning or holding a lollipop at the crossing after school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall pursue the question raised by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). .Having decided to opt out, a school could transfer non-teaching staff to provide the school meals service, for example. A school with 200 or 300 pupils may employ 10 people in the provision of school meals. There is an inconsistency here. The Bill clearly states that the board will then be able to put the services out to tender or, if it wishes, negotiate a contract with the local education authority. What will happen to the staff already employed? They will meet the same fate as that met by Health Service staff when a private tender is accepted—they will be sacked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the staff are not sacked how can the board go ahead with private competition and tendering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The honourable Gentleman is referring to the Health Service in the context of the Bill. He should know that competitive tendering in the Health Service has resulted in savings from £7,000 to £15 million, and that 80 per cent, of successful bids have come from in-house teams that have remained in the employment of the health authority. I hope that he will withdraw the suggestion that, in the context of the Bill, competitive tendering in schools would result in staff being dismissed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not respond to that invitation. Contrary to my earlier comments, both the Minister and the honourable Member for Fife, Central have strayed out of order. Shall we return to the main debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I have been somewhat harshly treated, Mr. Hogg, as I had no role to play in the matter. I accept the judgment of Chair, as usual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for now, as my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East would say. As a postscript to the ministerial remarks, I point out the honourable Gentleman's skill in using my specific question to give a general answer concerning something that I did not ask about—value for money in private tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know what happened to a Health Service facility in Fife, where 260 people provided cleaning. Initial Health Care came in and 260 people were sacked and 160 were taken on with no leave or sick pay and wages which were lower than the rate of social security. However, I apologise for digressing in response to the suggestion that I withdraw. I do not withdraw one bit. The inconsistency in the Bill is evident for all to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Non-teaching staff may be transferred into an opted-

out school where the school board then decides to privatise the facility or seek a competitive tender. If the competitive tender is accepted, only one thing can happen to the staff—the sack. Let us not use fancy words when we can be more blunt and specific. They will be sacked. For the record, it is useful to note that the Minister, who has ignored the question before, is not intervening to tell me how wrong I am—or how right I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in my honourable Friend's remark about having all-purpose staff and teachers turning their hand to cleaning at 4 o'clock when they finish their teaching duties. In the light of the Minister's reply, is it not possible that some boards of management might involve pupils in cleaning activities after 4 o'clock and that the Minister would take no action to prevent them from so doing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This affects conditions of service of staff and my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East has made a most imaginative intervention. It is not an original idea, because the Omega report to which I have briefly referred has already used it. Why just have teachers cleaning up? There is also a suggestion that pupils and parents do their bit for the community and save costs so that more can be invested in education and teaching. Unfortunately, it is not an original idea, but if the concept of the multi-purpose worker in Scottish education is to gain further ground, we should look also at the multi-purpose parent and pupil. That would certainly appeal to a broad spread of educational interest in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the nationally negotiated arrangements for teaching staff, the Minister must be aware that there is negotiating machinery covering sections of non-manual and clerical workers. On the other hand, there are manual workers who are covered by annual increases in wages. It is clear—although the Minister ducked the issue— that in a school that opts out, the board will be able to choose the levels of conditions and wages. That will lead to poorer standards and conditions of service. If the recurrent grant is worked out on the unit costs that were referred to earlier, some opted-out schools will have no option other than to force down wages of vulnerable groups. If the amount provided—particularly in the case of school meals—is based on the English unit cost formula, the schools will have inadequate sums of money fully to recompense even if they so wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now totally confused. In recent months, the honourable Gentleman's argument has been that the self-governing schools will be better funded than the local authority schools and that is why people will go for self-governing status. He is now telling the Committee that they will be worse funded. Neither is right. They will be funded on the same basis as the local authority schools. What is his position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that the Minister keeps missing the point. I am sure that he does not do it deliberately, but it becomes a trifle boring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula for a recurrent grant—we have details of how that has been worked out, with great difficulty, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
England and Wales—is not just taken from mid-air and given out. It is calculated on the specific educational concerns in which the education authority is involved; the provision of school meals is one example. The Minister should deal with the technicalities instead of using rhetoric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a school meal provision is transferred at the same unit cost as in the recurrent grant to the education authority, the self-governing school may be unable to provide such a service with the same number of staff because it will be unable to take advantage of the economies of scale. We are concerned about vulnerable workers, such as school meal helpers. Will the Minister comment on how the recurrent grant will ensure an adequate income where discretion is left to opted-out schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to repeat what I said. Self-governing schools will not be worse or better off financially than had they remained within the education authority system. If they need to benefit from expenditure incurred centrally, that will be taken on board. The honourable Gentleman's argument is bogus. He seems to change his argument to suit his point. He spent many months arguing that schools would be bribed into becoming self-governing by the promise of additional resources, but now he is arguing that they will be deprived of a proper school meals service. Neither argument is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue this point, but the Minister may require more handouts from his officials. He misses the point about the construction of the recurrent grant system. I asked the Minister whether the provision of school meals would be based on the English formula whereby when a service such as the provision of school meals is being considered for inclusion in the recurrent grant, the unit cost is worked out. A central kitchen may provide a service for many schools and thus bring down the unit cost per pupil or per meal. If that unit cost were transferred, the opted-out school would not have the benefits of the economies of scale enjoyed by the education authority, and would be unable to provide the same level of service, staffing and conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not seem to have crossed the honourable Gentleman's mind that the self-governing school will be able to ask the education authority to enter into a contract to continue to provide the school meal service if that is the most cost-effective option. It could also look to a private provider or its in-house provision. The overall funding of the school will be consistent with the funding it would have received had it remained within the education authority system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be glad to know, Mr. Hogg, that I shall not pursue this matter because it is clear that the Minister grudgingly accepts that if unit costs for a large number of schools are transferred to an opted-out school, which may be the only such school in the area, financial difficulties may arise. The Minister said that self-governing schools could negotiate with the education authority to provide school meals. That suggests that certain opted-out schools will find

The amendment is a good piece of old-fashioned knock-about stuff tabled for entertainment value. I thought that the Labour party had moved on in the past few years. We would have expected such a suggestion in 1979, but not in 1989 when the new realism had begun to take effect. This fanciful amendment shows that the new realism has not yet reached Committee Room 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main aim of the Bill is to enable schools to opt out of local authority control if they so wish. It follows that, if we are to invite boards of management to decide the future government of their schools, we must give them the freedom to decide whether to have one cleaner or one janitor. If they are to be hidebound by all the collective agreements that may have been made in the past, we may as well not bother. The whole point of the Bill is to allow boards of management to take crucial, fundamental decisions within the overall budget, which will be the same as if the school remained under local authority control. Surely the board of management must be responsible for determining how the money is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, we may take the novel view that schools are about educating children as well as being employment agencies and food provision agencies. There was once a view that schools were there not to educate children but to provide vast eating sheds, to which children went simply to eat school dinners. In education debates in the 1960s and 1970s, we often spent our time concentrating not on education but on the provision and payment of janitors and school cleaners. Although I understand that they have a role to play, the fundamental principle of the Bill is that the money that is to be made available to the boards of management must be spent as they decide. If local decision-making is to mean anything, they must have the unencumbered freedom to decide how to apportion their budgets.

Opposition Members comments this morning have contained some red herrings. Other legislation already requires local councils to ensure value for money. Opposition members seem to think that there is no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
need for value for money if schools remain under local authority control. Thankfully, during the past few years the Government have ensured that local authorities submit all their activities to competitive tender. The Local Government Act 1988—I served on the Standing Committee that examined the Bill—now requires local authorities to do so. The amendment would undermine part of that legislation. It is against freedom and harps back to the old days of the 1960s and 1970s, when Governments made special, cosy provision for trade union leaders—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: COHSE is the operative word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is right. Under those agreements, the trade union leaders knew best and employees always got the best deal from collective bargaining. We now know that that was never the case, as collective bargaining is not always the way to advance an employee's financial interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is fanciful, knock-about stuff, which we would have had in a Standing Committee in the 1960s and 1970s, and is inappropriate for legislating for the 1990s. It is about protecting the trade unions and their cosy relationship with local authorities. It is against freedom of decision making by those whom we have invited to decide, but, in any event, there is now a provision for local authorities to submit their services to competitive tender. If the Bill is to mean anything at all—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I wish to conclude and I do not think that the honourable Lady will add anything to what she has already said to the Committee. Oh well, I shall give way, .but I do not wish to delay the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the honourable Gentleman. Which would contribute more to his freedom—being paid £2.60 an hour or being paid £1.60 an hour? He lauds the freedom of opted-out schools to set what standards and conditions of service they like, but why do the Government come down like a ton of bricks on those local authorities who wish to pay more than nationally negotiated wage rates or to improve conditions of service? Why is there freedom for opted-out schools, but not for local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that local authorities like to pay more than anybody else because it is not their money. It is the ratepayers' money and it is easy to pay more than the market rate when local authorities can simply bung up the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The supply and demand of cleaners and their wage rate should not be a matter for Government. It should be a matter for the market place. The normal rules of the market and wage bargaining processes should determine what the wage rates of cleaners will be. The Government do not set the wage rates for the cleaners of Barclays bank, the Midland bank and so on. There is no nationally negotiated rate determined by collec-

tive bargaining for cleaners in banks, but if the honourable Lady goes into any bank in Scotland or England she will see that it is perfectly clean. Why should it be any different for schools? The disciplines of the market should apply to any public building that is subject to the normal rules of hygiene. They should certainly apply to those schools in which a board of management has been given the right to run its own affairs. If the board is not allowed to decide on provision or the wage rates of cleaners, what on earth are we doing here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Barbara Vaughan, one of the Minister's colleagues was mentioned earlier. She said that school meals were not part of the curriculum and I agree with her and not my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) who said that they were. They are not part of the school curriculum, but they are an essential—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. They are not part of the amendment. It relates to collective bargaining arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I extended your patience, Mr. Hogg, but I am coming oh to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools meals are an important educational matter. Earlier, the Minister said that he did not want to see school meals as a form of social security. However, if the wage rates that we have heard about are to be implemented, school meals will become a form of social security because of the low wages that people are paid. In an intervention the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) called it a wheeze, but it is not. He mentioned vast eating houses and I used to teach in one of them, where 95 per cent, of the children were on free school meals. That was before the implementation of the Social Security Act 1986, which turned the screw even more. I realise how vital school meals are. For many children, they are the most nutritious meal of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister about the person who had been a school cleaner for 20 years and whose wages were reduced after competitive tendering. That is not fanciful, because one of my constituents experienced that. If a woman told the Minister that she had been working for 20 years and now received only 80p an hour, what would he answer in his role as the Bill's architect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman asked a hypothetical question about what advice I should give to someone coming to my surgery who had been paid £1.60 an hour and whose wages had been reduced to 80p an hour. If that person worked in a self-governing school, I should advise him to take up the matter with the board of management. The board will consist of parents and reasonable people who will expect reasonable terms and conditions of employment. It is also reasonable to expect that people will not work for 80p an hour. The honourable Gentleman should have more faith in his constituents than to wish to tie them to agreements reached by trade unions as opposed to agreements based on their best judgment about the needs of the staff and the school as a whole.

The honourable Member for Fife, Central made great play of the unit costs of school meals. The honourable Member for Maryhill argued that the rates of pay in the local authority sector are considerably higher than in the private sector, yet the honourable Member for Fife, Central insists that the unit costs are lower although the rates of pay are proportionately higher. Those two positions are inconsistent. Fortunately, it will not be my job to resolve the problem but that of the boards of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the honourable Member for Fife, Central is correct—that is just possible—that in some schools the unit cost of the delivery of the school meals service by the local authority will be the most cost-effective solution, it will be open to the board of management to enter into a contract with the local authority to provide that service. It has been suggested that the local authority might not be willing to provide that service to self-governing schools. My honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has tabled an amendment that would place a duty on the local authority to respond to requests for such services. The honourable Member for Fife, Central will no doubt support that amendment on the basis of his argument that self-governing schools might be denied a cost-effective service. I agree with my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) who, with his usual perspicacity, put the argument clearly and concisely. I hope that the honourable Member for Fife, Central has been persuaded by my honourable Friend's rhetoric and will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my honourable Friend enlighten me on one part of the amendment which worries me? Opposition Members have spoken a great deal about the rights of cleaning ladies, but I have not heard much about the rights and duties of those being taught in the schools. If a school that is currently paying more than the market price for cleaning ladies opts out and can obtain the same service more cheaply, will it be able to use the money that it has saved to buy books or provide more for the children? I am confused. Opposition Members do not appear to have talked about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is right, but he must appreciate that there is a difference between us and Opposition Members, who are concerned about their friends in the trade unions. It is in the interests of trade unions to have everything determined by national negotiation because that provides their raison d'etre. Conservative Members are concerned about quality of education and the delivery of an effective education service. It is only natural that my honourable Friend should emphasise books and resources for teaching materials. He is right to say that any savings can be spent by the board of management on the provision of books and of education, but he must always remember that Opposition Members must think of the interests of the trade unions as well as of those of the education system. That tends to colour the debate from time to time, and that is why we have been discussing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- division -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 4, line 30, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the notes on clauses, subsection (3) empowers the board of management to provide education other than school education. They give the example that a board of management could provide adult education at the school. The new power that the subsection gives to the boards of management should be explained more fully by the Minister. I hope to tease out of him a better definition of what is meant by education other than school education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-governing schools will create problems for education authorities by competing with them to provide school education and will make it impossible to provide a comprehensive system of school education throughout an education authority area and to ensure that the highest standards of excellence are available to all pupils in all schools. The subsection creates further problems for education authorities by allowing the new self-governing schools to compete with them for other sorts of education — further education, community education and any other education provided outwith schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to introduce a range of measures covering training. They introduced the youth training scheme for 16 to 17-year-olds and the new employment training scheme for the adult unemployed, and there is continuing provision for the academic part of apprenticeship training. Adult training, retraining, second chance education and so on are provided by the further education and committee education systems. They are critical because, as the Minister knows, recent predictions suggest that there will be a shortage of labour. It is vital to ensure that the resources available to train people coming into industry are properly planned and directed to those people and to those sectors of the economy that most need it. That requires a high level of planning of the provision available for such training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there are many large areas of poverty in which many single parents, especially women, have been out of the employment market for a long time and require bridging courses to enable them to take advantage of courses in further education colleges and community education. The courses that were previously provided under the community pro-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
gramme are now struggling to obtain funding to enable women to be in a position to begin to apply for courses for O-grades, Higher grades and other qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such courses are to be provided, they must be planned in the areas in which they are needed and must be directed towards those who need them most. That suggests that there must be a central role for the education authority in planning and providing such courses through the further education and community education organisations. Their job is difficult enough already, but they will have to co-ordinate their activities and complement them with those of the new local training bodies that have been set up under the Scottish Enterprise initiative. They must ensure that whatever is required by the local economy and training is met through further education and community education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems will be created by the care in the community programme. The Minister has sat on the Griffiths report for more than a year and made it clear during a recent Adjournment debate that he will not make an early announcement on what he intends to do about the recommendations of that report. If care in the community is to be available in Scotland at a local level, a wide and extensive range of training courses must be made available to those who will look after people at present in long-term institutional care who will come into the community and require support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the provision is properly planned and that resources are directed where they are required. It will be unhelpful if, in addition to the existing training bodies that abound to an excess in Scotland, the Minister adds another possible training competitor in the form of self-governing schools. That will not help the proper provision of training in the community, but will add a further element to cause dissonance and lack of coherence in existing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one objects to the adult education that is currently provided by education authority schools. For example, in Dundee many local authority schools allow adults to take O-grades and Higher courses—there are standard grade courses now, too. If that is what the Minister means by other types of education in self-governing schools, no one would object to that, although we shall continue to object strongly to self-governing schools as such. However, if the Minister intends that those schools should set up in competition with the further education colleges in our cities, with the existing community education provision and the private sector training agencies, that is entirely the wrong way in which to build a strategy to deal with the future training problems of Scotland. The Minister should be putting in place a comprehensive and planned network of training facilities instead of trying to break up and separate that training provision by having different bodies competing with each other to become the most lucrative rather than reflecting the needs of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will clearly spell out exactly what is meant by the other sort of education that self-governing schools will be able to undertake and how that will relate to the existing provisions. How will the Minister ensure that such provision is co-ordinated so that there is a planned network of training available to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
meet the needs of those living in our communities and the needs of the Scottish economy, rather than meeting the needs of individual bodies that may be out to make a quick killing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a revealing amendment. For some months, opponents of the Bill have argued that self-governing schools would become isolated or that they would no longer be available for people to take night classes and so on. The EIS has used that argument frequently in public meetings. Yet the Opposition have tabled an amendment that would deny self-governing schools the ability to provide such facilities. We start from the standpoint that self-governing schools should retain all the essential characteristics of local authority schools and should be able to provide a range of facilities, such as further education, voluntary instruction courses, social, recreational and cultural activities, physical education and training, organised leisure-time activities, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am stunned that the honourable Member for Dundee, East wishes to prevent self-governing schools from offering those facilities to their communities on the ground that it would cause competition with the local authority and make it difficult to organise things. That sums up why the Opposition are against the Bill: They cannot stand the idea of diversity, competition or alternative provision. Many people in the communities will be served by self-governing and local authority schools and will welcome the diversity of provision that the Bill will offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the honourable Member for Dundee, East will withdraw his amendment as it is inconsistent with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
what his party says publicly about self-governing schools in Scotland. It would be a regressive step for us to suggest that such schools will be unable to provide those facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I thought that that was a sensible amendment and hoped that my honourable Friend the Minister would accept it. My honourable Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood failed to say that that was what the clause was about and that the amendment would outlaw that.
