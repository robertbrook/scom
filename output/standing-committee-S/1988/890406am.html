<p><i>Amendment proposed [4 April]:</i> No. 68, in page 4, line 48, to leave out subsection (6).—<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 46, in page 4, line 48, after "(6)", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the provisions of subsection (6A) below."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 45, in page 4, line 50, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6A) Before making, varying or revoking any standard or general requirement the Secretary of State shall consult the board of management of the school, the head teacher, duly authorised representatives of recognised teachers organisations and parents of children attending the school".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion<span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, at the close of business on Wednesday morning I had just finished moving amendment No. 68 and was waiting for the Minister to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland(Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was still in the throes of moving his amendment. It would require the Secretary of State to consult the board of management, the head teacher, the teachers' union representatives and parents before making any general regulations for self-governing schools. Amendment No. 68 would remove any facility for making general regulations for self-governing schools.<br><br>
I am slightly puzzled as to why it is considered to be desirable for the self-governing schools to be in a position where it would not be possible for us to make such regulations. If the concern of Opposition Members is for—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith<span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister does not yet have his brief. Would he be grateful if I gave him a little time to search for it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can see that the Minister is having a little difficulty.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know that that is what the hon. Member is doing. The Minister may want to find his papers. I understand the problem. I could suspend the sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), as always, is helpful, but I can just about manage to get myself through the amendment without the papers, which do not appear to be in my folder.<br><br>
The provisions are fairly clear. A set of general regulations operates in the schools, and they are amended from time to time. The last occasion on which they were amended was when the late Willie Ross was Secretary of State, when there was a major amendment. It is necessary to have the regulations because they govern the overall conduct of our schools in matters such as the length of the school year. The self-governing schools clearly have to operate within that context.<br><br>
Where we make changes to regulations, it is normal for us to carry out a consultation. There are exceptions. The most recent exception was when we laid the regulations that are now attracting so much interest in relation to the 80 per cent, rule on school closures. On that occasion it is true that we did not consult, but Opposition Members will recall the special circumstances that pertained at that time.<br><br>
I reassure the hon. Member for Dundee, East that we would consult generally on any regulations. The amendment is not necessary, and I hope that he will withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald<span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us whether it would be an appropriate regulation—within that general body of regulations—for the Secretary of State to require a self-governing school not to introduce selection on the grounds of academic ability?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, we shall discuss later the basic character of the schools and their ability to make changes. Changes of the sort that the hon. Gentleman mentioned have to be endorsed by the parents and the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will not be able to change the arrangements for admission to a self-governing school without the proper procedures set out in the Bill being carried out. Fundamental changes in the school's scheme of government will require the endorsement of the parents.<br><br>
Opposition Members are worried about the introduction of selection, but the present rules for schools maintained by education authorities allow an education committee to make a change of that type at the stroke of a pen. No consultation is required with parents or the Secretary of State. The Bill will introduce considerable safeguards.<br><br>
I now have my papers and see that I have nothing of substance to add. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Minister's answer, I remain as unconvinced as ever by, let us

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
say, the Prime Minister's smile. I do not wish to detain the Committee because we want to move on to the important business contained in a later clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause sets out the powers and duties of the board of management. Those powers, subject to some exceptions, are wide. I thought that this might be an opportunity to discuss the powers as they relate to the teaching of religious studies.<br><br>
I refer to an article in <i>Life and Work</i> written by the Rev. Robert Anderson, the minister of Overtown church in Wishaw, who was recently appointed chaplain at Edinburgh university. He makes some interesting points about the Bill, which are especially relevant to the clause. Early in his article he makes strong points about the decline of religious education, and I believe that that should be of concern to all members of the Committee. Referring to the Bill, he states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under new Government legislation the Church of Scotland could have the same educational privileges as does the Roman Catholic Church. It will be possible for our Church to administer its own schools. Government block grants will provide funds."</p></blockquote>
He adds—this is another strong point:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our Church seems to be afraid to seize the historical moment and use it for the glory of God.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Church of Scotland could and should sponsor and organise a network of Christian schools throughout Scotland… We cannot forever be ambulance people. We must prevent individual and social decay by stopping it at the source."</p></blockquote>
He also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Teaching staff would be recruited on the basis of profession of faith and academic and technical competence… It is Christian mission strategy."</p></blockquote>
That is powerful stuff. At the start of the article he states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Religious education is a joke in most schools"—</p></blockquote>
he is, of course, talking about Scottish schools. He goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Millitant anti-Christian policy has determined much of the character of education over the last 30 years."</p></blockquote>
I have seldom seen such a powerful and well-argued case in any article by a minister of religion in favour of religious education. Yet here is a minister of religion who has no political axe to grind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is against the poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That makes my point. I do not know whether Mr. Anderson is a Conservative supporter,—<i>[Interruption</i>] Indeed, it is irrelevant. However, he is a man of God who says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Militant anti-Christian policy has determined much of the character of education over the last 30 years."</p></blockquote>
He believes that the Bill provides an historic opportunity to reassert the importance of religious education in our schools. The boards of management will have the power to bring religious education back to the forefront, which the whole Committee should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
welcome. I hope that other members of the Committee who speak will place emphasis on that point and on the article by the Rev. Robert Anderson.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) in his remarks about the most significant intervention in the debate about the future of Scottish education by the Rev. Robert Anderson. As my hon. Friend said, he made some impressive statements. Whatever his political views, I am sure that the Church of England would welcome such men into its ranks.<br><br>
The significance of the article is that it is in contradiction to the general stand by the Church of Scotland. However, it shows that views are changing in Scotland. The Bill provides the opportunity for the debate to be opened up. Clearly, there are now divisions in the ranks of the Bill's opponents.<br><br>
This is an historic opportunity for the Church to run its own schools. I hope that it will be seized. At present there are 74 denominational schools in Scotland, and they are all Catholic. This is a tremendous opportunity, for those of us who are concerned about the moral dimension of teaching, for the Church of Scotland to ensure that the sort of teaching that it would like to see is incorporated in schools and that schools are not left simply to politicians of whatever description, particularly Socialist politicians, who are opposed to the concept of denominational schools. I should also like to tell the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who has disappeared suddenly—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall pass on the message.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was quoted in an article in <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> on 26 March as having said:
<br><blockquote><p>"As Labour begins to look like the next Government,"</p></blockquote>
I do not know where he got that idea from, since the opinion polls still leave the Conservative party well ahead—
<br><blockquote><p>"everyone begins to sit up and take notice of what we say and do … Many of those Tory placemen previously ignored us, but they now shift uneasily"</p></blockquote>
I think that the people who are beginning to shift uneasily are Labour supporters, who are concerned that they are no longer getting the uniform support that they received in the past in opposing the measure. Cracks are appearing. Sensible people in Scotland are beginning to realise that the Bill will give enormous opportunities.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will support the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth). My hon. Friend the Minister will recall that at Scottish Question Time yesterday, I drew attention to the important article by Mr. Anderson. It should be emphasised that education in the Christian tradition is available in Scottish schools: that is, the Catholic tradition. In non-denominational schools, for all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
practical purposes, there is, with minor exceptions, no significant religious content or emphasis. Mr. Anderson's views will certainly strike a chord with many people.<br><br>
It is also worth emphasising the possible importance of such schools in relatively deprived areas where demand for education with a Christian emphasis will be considerable.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston<span class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is the third Conservative Member today to emphasise that, as a consequence of the Bill, sectarian education can be provided and that religions can establish their own schools, such as Church of Scotland, Catholic, Presbyterian or Moslem schools. Is that Conservative party policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that that is only an aspect, and not the total range, of choice that should be available to parents. From my point of view and, I believe, from my hon. Friend the Minister's, I believe that in deciding to stop having single-sex schools, Strathclyde was denying parents a choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that Mr. Anderson was not talking about setting up sectarian schools but about boards of management having greater power to emphasise religious education and moral teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that was the point that Mr. Anderson made. However, I must point out to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) that if parents want a humanist emphasis, for example—<i>[Interruption.]</i> If that is what a group of parents want, there are strong arguments for allowing such a choice.<br><br>
I have referred to the religious aspects, partly because they have been in the public debate and partly because they are a practical example of the extension of education choice—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) wish to intervene? I cannot make out his sedentary gems of wisdom and wit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just noting your support for witchcraft in schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must not use the word "your". I am certainly not a supporter of witchcraft.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Hogg. Readers in Scotland will no doubt be interested to note that it is the view of the Labour Front-Bench spokesman in this Committee that religion is witchcraft.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whether or not the characteristics of schools include the matters to which the hon. Member refers comes later in the Bill. If the hon. Member remains with the powers and duties of boards of management, he will definitely be in order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I was tempted down an unwise path by the hon. Member for Srathkelvin and Bearsden, who is speaking officially on behalf of the entire Labour party this morning. He expressed the view that religion is witchcraft. I shall return directly to clause 7.<br><br>
Does my hon. Friend the Minister believe that Mr. Anderson's wishes would be best met by the powers and duties given to a board of management under clause 7, by more general powers, or by new clause 1, which we shall discuss later? The powers and duties set out in clause 7 refer to existing schools that assume self-governing status. I do not criticise Mr. Anderson, but it is not clear whether he is referring to the route described in clause 7 for the envisaged network of schools or the more general route, which would be possible under new clause 1.<br><br>
I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that at Question Time yesterday I suggested a meeting with people interested in the extension of choice in Scottish education. I am not asking him for a specific commitment as I have not made a specific request, but I wish to give him notice that I might want to return to that point later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in some ways a rather unlikely champion of the established Church of Scotland. My great-grandfather was a minister of the free Church of Scotland, so my family tradition is that of the free Church. However, Mr. Anderson's article proves the value of the Bill because it shows that the greater opportunities that it offers are opening up a new debate. The Bill provides opportunity and choice, such as the capacity of the Church of Scotland, if it sees fit, to set up a network of its own schools. I agree to that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is speaking in support of setting up denominational schools. It might be possible to debate that under other provisions of the Bill, but not in relation to clause 7, which deals with the powers and duties of a board of management. I am sure that he can make his point without straying too far out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always anxious not to stray from the path of virtue and order. I am aware that the clause is devoted to the powers and duties of boards of management, but it is through the exercise of those powers and duties that choice can make its impact. There are dangers in denominational schools, but there are also significant advantages. It is unfair of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) to describe them as sectarian, because that has an emotive content which I think unfair. Used in the wrong way, the powers and duties of the board of management of a denominational school could certainly be used for the worse. But there are ways in which they could be used for the good of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be an unfair description, but it is accurate. What is education provided by a denomination or religion that establishes a school particularly for its own adherents other than sectarian?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0226">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be lured away from the issue before us, having been rebuked earlier by you, Mr. Hogg. However, with my eye firmly on the powers and duties of the board of management, I say to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber that religion can be used as a divisive force, and when that happens, it is sectarian. That has definite connotations of division. That is bad. Equally, Church schools in England and Scotland have a history, from the Catholic tradition, of providing very good education, particularly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said, in deprived areas. I am sure that the Church of Scotland emphatically does not wish to stir up sectarian passions. Through the powers and duties of the boards of management in the schools it could provide better and more traditional education in deprived areas, especially the inner cities where it is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct about my views. Does he agree that is is important to stress that under clause 7 a board of management might set up a school with such an emphasis, but that that is not an exclusive concept? Catholic single-sex schools appeal to people of other religions, notably Islam. Many people who are not Christians may nevertheless be attracted to the type of school that my hon. Friend referred to because of the more traditional education provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I have been dealing with the established Church of Scotland and with Mr. Anderson's order. The merit of the Bill is that the powers and duties of the board of management can be exercised in such a way as to give a wide range of choice and opportunity. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood is right. That choice extends right across different religions and different approaches to education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for drawing the Committee's attention to the profound matters that are at last being dealt with in this stand part debate.<br><br>
There are two reasons why the clause should be supported unanimously by the Committee. First, the boards of management will reduce the power of the state. Secondly, they will provide opportunities for parents, if parents choose to take them up.<br><br>
In many senses, the proposals for the boards of managements' powers and responsibilities are radical, as one would expect from a radical Government. It was interesting to read the article by Mr. John Scott in the April 1989 edition <i>of Life and Work.</i> He reminds us that many of the responsibilities of the boards of management are a return to more traditional ways of life in Scotland. The article says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In fact the establishment of school boards"—school boards are the same idea as boards of management—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"means a return to the Scottish tradition of local schools founded, managed and staffed by the local community."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The clause is not about school boards. I am impressed by hon. Members' enthusiasm for <i>Life and Work,</i> which is approved reading. I hope that hon. Members who are quoting from it will turn to page 56 and read my excellent book review in this month's issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should need your guidance, Mr. Hogg, as to whether it would be in order to quote from your book review.<br><br>
I was not seeking to discuss school boards, but merely to link the concept of school boards with boards of management, which are the same idea. Boards of management are a return to a traditional way of running schools that the Scots have had for many years.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The clause should be supported because of the state's role in respect of the new powers that we are giving the boards of management. The Rev. Robert Anderson made two significant remarks:
<br><blockquote><p>"Since 1872, the State has been responsible for education."</p></blockquote>
I presume that Opposition Members will want that to continue.
<br><blockquote><p>"The God-centred dimension has slowly been eroded to the point of insigificance."</p></blockquote>
If there is a causal relationship here, it is disgraceful. He also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There was an intention in 1872 to preserve the Christian dimension in education. No-one could have foreseen the insinuation of atheism and agnosticism into the decision-making spheres of our educational system."</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately, that has happened under state control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend read the Church of Scotland's submission to members of the Committee? It makes many interesting points, but I have yet to find a mention of God or religion, which seems extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point.<br><br>
He is drawing the Committee's attention to the
spiritual and mor dimension—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. God and religion may not be mentioned in the Church of Scotland's submission, but neither are they mentioned in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) will have heard that point of order. Frankly, I am not sure how to respond to it. The hon. Gentleman's remarks were not strictly in order, but I am sure that he will develop his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. As you were not sure how to answer the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), perhaps I could assist you. Clause 7(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The board of management of a self-governing school shall manage the school, shall provide suitable and efficient school education".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0227">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
My hon. Friends and I have been concentrating on the duty to provide suitable education, so references to the Kirk's contributions to the debate are important. We regard suitability as embracing religion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amos</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Hogg, but it was a valuable comment. Opposition Members do not seem to want to engage in a discussion on the spiritual and moral aspects of the board of management's duties. They must respond to the Rev. Robert Anderson's points about the "disillusionment of teachers" and the "lack of discipline". He also refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"The dismissal of Christian influence to the periphery of school life".</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members must say why they do not want the management of some schools to change. If the Rev. Robert Anderson's remarks are true—they are undoubtedly true in many cases—what is the Opposition's solution? By allowing schools to opt out, we are giving parents the responsibility to return to some form of traditional values.<br><br>
The boards of management will give parents the opportunity to re-order the duties and responsibilities of the management of the school so that the spiritual and moral aspects that we have referred to today can be taken into account and thus end disillusionment among teachers. Parents will feel that when their children leave school they will have learnt more than just academic and technical subjects and will have gained a new dimension to their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 7 goes to the heart of what Conservative Members want to see happen in opted-out schools. The most important duty that is placed on the board of management is to ensure that suitable and efficient school education is provided. It is the suitability of that education which has in the past been called into question and has necessitated the Bill. The Government introduced this Bill and the Education Reform Act 1988 for England because there was a growing public perception that school education was becoming unsuitable. As, after two decades, the comprehensive experiment was not delivering what its founding fathers thought it would, there was a growing feeling that a new type of education was required.<br><br>
I want the opted-out schools to offer education that has the standards of excellence that have been sadly lacking in the recent past. What is wrong with an opted-out school using clause 7 to return to the days when children had to sit examinations? I hope that the boards of management will use the powers available to them to set their own internal examinations. Perhaps children will once again be asked to multiply 9,090,999 by 90,909. Perhaps once again children will be asked to reduce to its simplest Form: 1/2-1/12+1/15-1/20.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing<span class='memberconstituency'> (Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly interested in the hon. Gentleman's use of figures. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
understand that he said yesterday that he had spent six hours on Tuesday with nothing to do in a Standing Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that the <i>Official Report</i> shows that I participate fairly actively in the Committee. When Opposition Members make slightly longer speeches, I am also able to get on with one or two other matters at the same time. I think that the hon. Lady would agree that when the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald)) speaks it is possible to do quite a lot of other work as well as Committee work.<br><br>
I want opted-out schools to use clause 7 to ask the children the sort of questions that parents were once asked. Why cannot examinations be set in the schools that test the pupils to the full? Why cannot pupils be asked history questions such as what happened on the following dates: 1174, 1263, 1297, 1314, 1513 and 1603? What Scottish sovereigns were imprisoned in England for a lenghty period?—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure that that point is relevant to the powers and duties of the boards of management, which is what we are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that it is vital—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. That must be the fourth or fifth time that you have had to ask a Conservative Member to return to the clause. Is it in order for Conservative Members to filibuster—[Hon. Members: "Oh."]—on their own Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a word, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer that point, Mr. Hogg. Not one Conservative Member, apart from the Minister, has spoken for longer than 10 minutes throughout our proceedings. However, we have had to endure speeches by the hon. Member for Western Isles that have lasted more than an hour. So I hope that we shall not have such points of order from him again.<br><br>
It is vital for opted-out schools to use the new freedom to set the standards that were set in the past in Scotland, when children were asked those questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the first of my hon. Friend's arguments, but it is important to remember that, whether he or I or the Minister takes that point of view, under clause 7 it is up to the parents to agree with us. There is no question of imposing our views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting— <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Our proceedings are interesting and I am sure that the three Opposition Members who are talking among themselves will want to follow what is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point, which was underlined by my hon. Friend, is that my suggestions will have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
approval of parents because they will have voted for the school to opt out. That decision will call forth higher standards. The opted-out schools will provide a suitable education by testing the children at a much higher level than at present. It is time that Scottish children were once again required to answer questions such as what Scottish sovereigns were imprisoned in England for a lengthy period, what led to their imprisonment and by whom Scotland was ruled in their absence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Clause 7 gives extensive powers to the boards of management, but it does not include imprisoning sovereigns. The hon. Member should come back to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but my point is that schools will want to set examinations to ensure that the standards are sufficiently high. They will want to put the questions that used to be put to schoolchildren in England and Scotland, but are no longer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman know?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the Highlands and Islands Commission grammar school bursaries examination paper of 1883, which contains the questions to which I referred. The hon. Member for Western Isles may be interested to know that the first part of the paper, for which half an hour was allowed, was a translation into English from Gaelic—[Hon. Members: "Pronounce it properly."] Hon. Members have an unfair advantage over me. Perhaps I should put this examination paper on the table and my hon. Friend the Minister might give a bottle of whisky to any hon. Member who can complete in six and a half hours the questions that were asked in 1883 of a pupil aged 14—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members are getting a little excited. The hon. Member should speak to the Chair in a conversational tone; he need not shout.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hogg. Perhaps you can preside over the competition. I shall ensure that copies of the examination paper are left here. It states that no help is allowed, but I think that some assistance might be permitted. When the hon. Member for Western Isles, who is leaving the room, next makes a lengthy speech, the Opposition might like to attempt the paper. It is of the highest standard, and was set for the sons of crofters, when they could obtain the thorough education for which Scotland was famed in the 19th century. We can regain that standard of education only by passing clause 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I am not sure how to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). I assume that he had a 26 fl oz bottle of whisky in mind as a prize, rather than a larger one. I should be very happy to provide it.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that he will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
give a 26 litre—<i>[Laughter.</i>]—I mean a 26 fl oz bottle of whisky to anyone who completes the paper accurately?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Provided that I am exempted from taking part in the competition, I shall be happy to put up the prize and to make the appropriate marking arrangements. I have not studied every question, but I think that it is asking a lot of the Committee to expect answers to all the questions. I am happy to put up a bottle of whisky for the hon. Member who attains the highest score.<br><br>
My hon. Friend made an important point about clause 7 and the duties of the boards of management. Scottish education was broadly based and rigorous, stretching children to the limit of their abilities and providing every child with an opportunity. I hope that the boards of management, in exercising their responsibilities under clause 7, will take account of opportunities for children.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) issued a press release, which stated that the Committee would discuss a clause that is six clauses ahead of the one that we are considering. That was raised during Scottish Question Time and I know that the hon. Gentleman is anxious to press on, so I do not wish to detain the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is willing to give way, and I am sure that he will do so soon. He is, however, entitled to develop his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your protection, Mr. Hogg.<br><br>
My hon. Friends made a series of important speeches about religious instruction in schools. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) seemed to find that a joke, and he talked about witchcraft. In the bad old days, dissident women in Scotland were burned as witches. It is obvious that the Opposition believe that any dissent, or alternative view about education must be squeezed out of the system and that people must accept whatever the education committee is prepared to offer them. That is why the Opposition oppose the Bill and especially clause 7, which enables the boards of management to provide a form of education that meets the wishes and aspirations of parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not only parents who want more choice for their children. Has my hon. Friend read an article that suggested that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) visited him to request his support for diversity of supply in education? Interest is not, therefore, confined to parents, but extends to Opposition Members.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never rely on reports in the Scottish press to ascertain what has been happening in my office. I have been approached by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy), who is rightly worried about school provision in his area and is seeking to represent parents' interests. I have met parents interested in the Bill.<br><br>
However, I wish to stick closely to clause 7 and the arguments made by my hon. Friends so that the Committee may make progress. I have studied the interesting article by Robert Anderson and am surprised that it has not caused comment among Opposition Members. It raises questions that reflect on the duties of boards of management in self-governing schools. Even the Bill's most jaded opponent could recognise from the article a cry by a man of the Church for more emphasis on religious teaching in schools. Many parents will respond enthusiastically to that cry. It is mistaken to associate interest in religious teaching solely with denominational, or special Church schools. Mr. Anderson's argument is that schools are not putting sufficient emphasis on religious education. Multi-denominational schools could rectify that, and clause 7 provides boards of management with the necessary powers.<br><br>
Mr. Anderson's assertion—that many people in the Church supported the Bill, but were afraid to admit it because the Government were proposing it—was interesting. He states in the article:
<br><blockquote><p> "Whether we agree with this Government's politics in general or its education policy in particular, an opportunity is nevertheless being presented to us which we should not ignore."</p></blockquote>
That opportunity can be delivered through clause 7.<br><br>
As Opposition Members have detained the Committee into the early hours of the morning, it was astounding to hear the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) complaining about filibustering by my hon. Friends. Indeed, the only speeches on the importance of religious instruction were made by them, which is depressing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not complaining, but merely stating that while it is normal for the Opposition to filibuster, it is remarkable for the Government to filibuster on their own Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Nobody is filibustering, because that is out of order. The Government cannot be accused of filibustering now, although we shall see how matters proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. If the hon. Member for Western Isles believes that a series of five speeches lasting five or 10 minutes delivered by my hon. Friends about religious instruction in schools on a clause stand part debate is a filibuster, his view of the importance of religious education is even more jaded that I first imagined. The subject is not a priority for Opposition Members, who rather wish to ensure that the education offered by education authorities—whether sufficient or not—is the only education that people will receive. The Government wish to see more variety and diversity in the system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an article in today's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
<i>The Scotsman,</i> which alleges that the Bill is being "bulldozed through the Commons" by the Government. That accusation was made by the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that it is the Opposition who are trying to bulldoze the Bill through without considering the merits of its most important clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have different priorities. Some of their amendments reflect the interests of trade unions, of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and of other bodies. To be fair, other Opposition amendments reflect the interests of parents, of the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, and of the Scottish Consumer Council. However, others had to be hastily withdrawn after the Opposition had worked out exactly what the amendments meant. The Opposition withdrew overnight an amendment that was originally proposed by the SPTC, giving schools providing for special needs the right to opt out, which was in conflict with the amendments dealt with in their press release yesterday. I am sure, Mr. Hogg, that you will call me to order if I stray much further down that road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is attempting to debate amendments that have been withdrawn, and I hope that he will refrain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hogg, but I was provoked by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). I shall try not to succumb to the temptations that he lays in my path.<br><br>
Conservative Members knew that there is a demand for schools to be allowed to create their own ethos, a fact that the apostles of uniformity in the education establishment find disconcerting. Clause 7 gives schools the opportunity to create an ethos that is not dictated by the education authority.<br><br>
There is a demand in Scotland for schools with a distinct Christian ethos, which is now provided only by the denominational schools. The record of those schools shows—<i>[Interruption].</i> Does the hon. Member for Fife, Central want to challenge anything that I have said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister justify his statement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only schools with a religious ethos are the denominational schools—that is self-evident. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand that, it would explain why there have been no worthwhile contributions to the debate from Labour Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minster saying that schools such as Lenzie academy do not have a religious ethos?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lenzie academy and other schools would be the first to claim that they do not have a distinct religious ethos. The only schools in Scotland that would claim a religious ethos are the denominational schools. Such an ethos contributes

to the education process. I am glad to see that there are some within the Kirk—[Hon. Members: "Be careful."] Opposition Members say, "Be careful." They do not want to debate the issues, because they know that the Bill, especially clause 7, enables boards of management to provide—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is sneering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are parents in Scotland who would not want their children to go to a school with a distinct religious ethos. Equally there are others who would, and the Bill provides for the creation of educational diversity, in which Opposition Members are not interested. I am glad that there are now some within the Kirk who recognise the potential of—<i>[Interruption].</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is talking so loudly that I cannot hear the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that there are some in the Kirk who recognise the potential of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he welcomes the extension of sectarian education in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would welcome boards of management using the powers granted to them in the Bill to meet the desire of parents for schools to place an appropriate emphasis on religious education. The hon. Gentleman used the word "sectarianism". That is an emotive and unwise word. Under the parents' charter, many denominational schools attract large numbers of parents because of their distinctive ethos and climate. Notre Dame, which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has already mentioned, is a good example.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The education committee of the Kirk, to which some of my hon. Friends have referred, does not seem to have understood the legislation's potential, as pointed out in the article in <i>Life and Work.</i> It appears to believe that a self-governing school will be a private and selective enclave, whereas our purpose is that such schools, and all public schools, should be as open as possible to all who want to attend them. The boards of management will be obliged to meet that requirement, in accordance with the wishes of the parents. Self-governing schools will not be for only the better off, as the education committee of the Church of Scotland suggested. They will not get special treatment on resources. They will provide a genuine alternative, which will especially benefit pupils from deprived areas. There is plenty of evidence, from research and from school inspectors' reports, of the importance of expectations as an indicator of a school's effectiveness. There is no doubt that low teacher expectations of pupils' capabilities damage pupil performance. The self-governing option allows a school to establish a positive ethos, whether or not it is based on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
religion, and to set challenging targets, of the type described by my hon. Friends, to pupils of all abilities.<br><br>
We seek diversity where the Opposition seek uniformity. Clause 7 provides for that diversity, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>

THE SCHEME OF GOVERNMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 89, in page 48, leave out lines 18 to 22 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(b) a person who is eligible for election to a board of management as a parent member, will not be eligible for appointment to that board, and;"[Mr. <i>McLeish.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment applies to the board of management of a self-governing school the same provisions that exist under the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 whereby parents and staff who are eligible for election may not also be co-opted.<br><br>
I am slightly puzzled by the amendment. We had a good debate, in which my hon. Friends participated, and which was headlined in one of the Scottish newspapers to the effect that Conservative Back Benchers had supported a Labour amendment on opt-out. My undertaking that I would look again at parental majority was hailed as a movement on my part.<br><br>
The amendment would remove our ability to deliver the parental majority because it would prevent—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. He moved the amendment formally; if he would like to explain why it would not do that, I shall happily give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond, later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would make it no longer possible for parents to be co-opted. As head teachers will be members of the board of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
management, and as it was proposed in our previous debate—which I undertook to consider—that the board of management remain broadly in line with the school board, the effect would be that there would be equal numbers of parents and other representatives. The other representatives would include staff, the head teacher and the co-opted members. Under the amendment, it would not be possible to have a co-opted representative who was a parent; therefore, it would not be possible to have a parental majority. I ask the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to withdraw his amendment on the basis that it would defeat the object that he worked so hard to achieve the other day, when I undertook to look again at establishing a parental majority—unless the commitment that we saw from the Opposition to parental majorities has produced a palace revolt inside the Labour party and it is now necessary to retract what they fought so hard to gain from the Government during our deliberations.<br><br>
I was disappointed that the hon. Member for Fife, Central sought only to move the amendment formally because I should have been fascinated to hear his reasons for it. But he has said that he will respond and I suggest to him that he would do well to withdraw the amendment and allow the Committee to move on to the next amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the important matters to be discussed later, I shall not respond to the political rhetoric that now characterises the statements from the Under-Secretary. Suffice it to say that the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, which is funded by the Secretary of State and is withering away in terms of support for this objectional measure, is concerned about the balance between the parents and the co-optees. We want a balance on the self-governing school boards between genuine non-parental interest and parents within all communities. The purpose of the amendment is to obtain from the Minister an idea of the distinction between the two groups. Whether there is a parental majority or not, it is essential that the co-optees represent a fair spread of opinion. If the schedule is not amended self-governing school boards could contain parents representing parents and a large number of parents representing co-opted interests. That might not be an inconsistency in terms of the profile of the activities of a self-governing school board, but there is genuine concern about the overweighting of parental interest as against the legitimate aspirations of co-optees who have a certain regard for and contribution to make to the school.<br><br>
That is the justification for the amendment, but as usual the Minister has risen to an ideological bait without giving any cognisance to the substance of an amendment that has been prepared and put forward by an organisation which he has taken great credit for, nurtured and financed, but to which he will not now give a reasonable response in Committee. I give the Minister an opportunity to say something about the points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something constructive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend suggests, something constructive. If not—in view of the

Minister's comments, he is unlikely to accept the offer—we would withdraw the amendment, having received no assurances and no further illumination of the points made by the SPTC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not find that a convincing response. If the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment because the SPTC gave it to him, the SPTC would expect him to be consistent with the Opposition's policy. On 23 March, in respect of amendment No. 54, I undertook to re-think our position on the composition of the governing body in order to provide for a parental majority. The hon. Gentleman may recall that our deliberations were curtailed because of the sad news that greeted the Committee that morning, but the undertaking was given. Some of my hon. Friends supported the Labour party's amendment but, to my astonishment and that of my hon. Friends, Opposition Members expressed the clear wish—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Should not the Minister deal merely with the specific points I raised on the amendment, or can we open up the debate to discuss the issue of a parental majority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The Minister is entitled to make a speech that he feels is appropriate providing it is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My speech seems to be causing the hon. Member for Fife, Central some discomfort. I think that arises because of the absurd position into which he has got himself.<br><br>
On the School Boards (Scotland) Bill the hon. Gentleman took a position against a parental majority on boards of management. On amendment No. 54 to this Bill, he was in favour of a parental majority. He is now tabling an amendment which would remove our ability to deliver a parental majority, and he has told the Committee that he moved it only as a favour to the SPTC, and that he is not committed to it.<br><br>
I know the position of the SPTC and I shall meet it on Friday to discuss its views. However, I should like to know the Opposition's position. Do they want a parental majority on boards or not? If they do, they should not table an amendment that would remove our ability to achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister ruling out the possibility of a directly-elected parental majority on a board of management? Does he mean that the only way to achieve a parental majority is by the addition of co-optees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall whether the hon. Gentleman was present for the debate on amendment No. 54. If he reads that debate, he will see that the Labour party's position was that there should not be additional co-optees, but that co-optees should be consistent with the school board. The Opposition said that there was no question of changing the numbers of elected parental representatives. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to debate that, we shall have the opportunity to do so.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
The Government's position is to have the same composition as on school boards and to add co-opted representatives. The Opposition were against co-opted representatives in the former debate as they felt additional representatives would get rid of the parental majority and democratic accountability. If the hon. Gentleman says that we should have more elected representatives, that implies that we should have more co-opted representatives than were on the school boards. On amendment No. 54, the Labour party said that we should not do that. It is not I who am in a difficult position, but the Opposition, who have not worked out their position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which question does the hon. Gentleman want me to answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that in the review that will consider the parental majority, the point contained in the amendment will be looked at? If he does, will he tell the Committee, so that we can get on with our business?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What exactly does the Hon. Gentleman wish me to do? What does he mean by "looked at"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister read the <i>Official Report</i> of our Committee proceedings? We moved an amendment that was supported by Conservative Members, and we meant what it says. We have asked for the parental majority and the Minister has agreed to consider it. Let us not get into any intellectual tautology about where we stand on that issue. The amendment seeks to ensure that we do not end up with parents dominating both the elected positions and all the co-opted positions. We wish to know whether that would compromise the issue of fair representations.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The Minister is shaking his head, but the point is simple. Will fair representation from the community sector be compromised if elected members and co-opted members are all parents? The amendment was submitted by the SPTC to strike a balance, and was supported by the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am thoroughly confused. I do not understand what the hon. Gentleman is asking me to do. It would be helpful for the Committee if he spelt out his standpoint. If he is arguing that the co-opted representatives should not be parents, it would not be possible for us to achieve the parental majority for which he was arguing on amendment No. 54.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a great deal of respect for the Minister's political ideology, but I always have a great respect for his intellect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A mistake.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am on record as saying that, and will not withdraw it. It may cost me a few votes within the party in later life. I wonder why the Minister is confused. The point of the amendment is to discover whether the parental majority as elected would be compromised if every member of the self-governing school board was a parent. Would the Minister consider that a problem? If not, and he can convince us of why not that is fine. I would offer to withdraw the amendment, to ease the programme for today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now understand why the hon. Gentleman is confused. He used the phrase the "parental majority as elected." What he has not grasped is that the head teacher is a member of the board of management. Since the board reflects the same composition as the school board, there is no parental majority as elected. The number of parents will be equal to that of the head teacher, plus the co-opted representatives, plus the teacher representatives. It is because the hon. Gentleman thinks that a parental majority will be elected that he is confused. The only way in which a parental majority can be delivered, as discussed on amendment No. 54, is by co-opting a parent.<br><br>
If we accepted this amendment, the board would be unable to co-opt a parent and deliver the parental majority that the hon. Gentleman wishes. When tabling amendments and asking me to consider matters before Report—which he is anxious to do—he should take account of the meaning of those amendments, and the consequences of the actions that we are willing to take following proper debate and consideration. Perhaps, in the light of that, the hon. Gentleman would withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is inevitable that such debates add confusion upon confusion. It would have been interesting if the Minister had glanced over his shoulder, as he would have seen the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were looking quizzically at the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were looking quizzical. The question was whether the parental majority was being considered further. The Minister seems to have made up his mind that there will be no parental majority, but that can be left for another day.<br><br>
The simple point is this. Is the Minister happy to have parents involved in everything apart from teaching? Is he sure that that will not compromise the overall contribution of the community element? If so, will he say so, and I shall then withdraw the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for detaining the Committee. I am happy with what is in the Bill. When we discussed amendment No. 54 the hon. Gentleman asked me to rethink the provision in order to create a parental majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister rethinking?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rethinking whether I was wise to take the hon. Gentleman's advice, because, clearly he had not understood the provisions in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister confirming that he is reconsidering the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman pressed for a parental majority. The Bill provides that there should be additional co-opted representatives, which means that there would be no parental majority unless all the co-opted representatives were parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about elections?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of parents will be elected to the board of management.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the parental majority. The Minister is becoming confused himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that that is the parental majority, but he has not grasped the point. According to amendment No. 54, which he tabled and I agreed to consider on the basis of his arguments, the composition of the board of management would be the same as the composition of the school board. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is with me so far—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but the Minister must accept—I am sorry if this is an acrimonious point—that he responds from a ministerial position. Will he answer specific questions and not delay the Committee-delay being part of the Conservative party's strategy today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am not prepared to accept charges that I, or my colleagues, are detaining the Committee. I have spoken for no more than 10 minutes in any contribution. When we were appointed to this Committee, the Opposition said that we would sit here, get on with our correspondence and take no part in the proceedings. I hope that we have shown that we take the Bill seriously and make serious contributions. I resent the hon. Gentleman's accusation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a point, but it is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rest on the point that a simple statement by the Minister will suffice. We shall await with interest a further contribution on Report, or elsewhere, on the concept of parental majority. It is evident that there are differences between what my hon. Friends understood when the matter was debated earlier and what they now understand to be the role of parents and of elected parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not receiving that message.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that if the hon. Member for Fife,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
Central (Mr. McLeish) had wanted to make progress while keeping the amendments that Opposition Members table logical, he should surely not have moved amendment No. 89?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right, but to be fair to the hon. Member for Fife, Central, it is as well that he moved the amendment—albeit formally,—because it has exposed a blockage in the Opposition's thinking. The hon. Gentleman is quoted in the press today as saying that how we respond to amendments is an acid test of the Government's willingness to listen to outside bodies. I regard every amendment as important, whoever tables it. Our ability to respond is an acid test of how seriously we take the Committee's proceedings and when I listened to the hon. Gentleman's arguments for moving amendment No. 54, I was convinced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. It was not my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) who moved amendment No. 54, but the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I am happy to rest on the shoulders of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) the credit that is due. I wished to respond to the Opposition's desire for a parental majority, but this amendment reveals that the Opposition were not aware of the consequences of that amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall just make my point. Perhaps the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) will then be able to rescue the hon. Member for Fife, Central and explain the position to him.<br><br>
Following the discussion about a parental majority, I asked officials to consider it. The amendment would make it impossible for me to deliver such a majority and I was trying to explain why to the hon. Member for Fife, Central. The composition of a board of management would be the same as that of a school board as a result of the amendment. I undertook to consider that but have reached no firm conclusions. The hon. Gentleman's colleagues pressed us to adopt a composition for a board of management which reflected that of a school board. Unlike the school board, the board of management will include the head teacher as a member, so there will be no parental majority. When the hon. Gentleman talks about an elected parental majority he is talking about the school board, not the board of management. This amendment would prevent a co-opted member from being a parent, so there would not be a parental majority. The hon. Gentleman has given no guidance on how the Government could accept the amendment and also deliver his other objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to clear the matter up. Amendment No. 65 was tabled by the hon. Member for Fife, Central and his colleagues during the sixth sitting on 23 March. I read the amendment and liked what I saw. I suggested to my hon. Friend the Minister that he should accept it, but the hon.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
Gentleman withdrew it. I assume that on Report my hon. Friend the Minister will table an amendment with exactly the same wording as the original amendment. The hon. Member for Fife, Central nods his assent. That being so, we must not, under any circumstances, accept this amendment, which should not have been moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall comment later on the matter. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>[SIR RUSSELL JOHNSTON in the Chair.]</p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 48, line 29, leave out from "be" in line 29 to end of line 31 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"three years but shall be renewable as specified in the articles for another two to four years".</p></blockquote>
In contrast to the handling of the previous amendment, I should like to revert to a more traditional method, and speak to this amendment at the start of the debate. In that way, we may be able to make speedy progress. Having made one speech of approximately six minutes this morning, I do not propose to speak for any longer than that. I hope that I shall not be accused of filibustering, or endeavouring to delay the Committee's proceedings. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) said, when Conservative Members contribute to the proceedings, we rigorously keep our speeches brief. In welcoming you to the Chair, Sir Russell, let me assure you that I shall be fairly brief in putting forward an amendment whose purpose is clear.<br><br>
Amendment No. 86 would limit to three years the term of office of appointed members of the board of management of a self-governing school, with members having the option to renew their period of office for a further two to four years. That is a more flexible formula than the specified period of between five and seven years in paragraph 4 of schedule 1.<br><br>
The amendment was suggested by the Scottish Consumer Council. We have already considered broad issues concerning the term of office of members of the board of management, especially when debating clause 4. However, our discussions concentrated principally of the terms of office of the parent members of the board. The argument for a more flexible formula is that some people may be discouraged from offering their services if they are expected to serve a term of office of five to seven years. That is a fairly lengthy period of office to which to commit oneself. However, it is important to have continuity in the membership of the board, so that no disruption is caused by too many members having to learn the ropes at any one time.<br><br>
There is a point in the first term of office of appointed members being set down as three years, rather than the four years that will be served by other parent and staff members of the committee. The point is to avoid too many members of the board
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
changing at the same time.<br><br>
It is the practice of many representative public bodies to appoint members for three years and thereafter for the appointment to be renewable for two or more years. The amendment would secure the initial commitment of members of the board without prejudice to the long-term continuity of the board of management. It would widen the number of candidates who might put themselves forward for appointment to the board by making membership of the board more attractive.<br><br>
I hope that Opposition Members are listening to what I am saying on this important amendment. I apologise to the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who is clearly listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am hanging on the hon. Gentleman's every word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. As she knows, I hang on every word of her considered and generally brief contributions to the Committee—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Russell. It would be easier to hear my hon. Friend if conversations were not being held elsewhere in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is usual for hon. Members to listen to contributions carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment has no theological or partisan content; it concerns a practical matter. When I read the Scottish Consumer Council's submission to the Committee, I felt that the issue was worth considering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. No party politics are involved, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and Opposition Members will agree that the amendment is reasonable. Five to seven years is a heavy commitment for people to make when they do not always know what life holds for them that far ahead. Members of all political parties know to our bitter experience that people are sometimes unable to complete three of four-year terms on a district or county council. A seven-year term is long; my hon. Friend the Minister should consider the amendment seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is important; for once, I am in sympathy with a Conservative amendment, but not with the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). The critical issue is not whether people are prepared to commit themselves to seven years on a board of management, but how we ensure that, whatever activities the board of management becomes involved in, it is democratically accountable for its decisions and actions.<br><br>
In our previous debate, the Minister misrepresented my wish to ensure that there was a democratic majority on boards of management. I remember clearly saying that the technical worthiness of amendments Nos. 54 and 40 was in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
question and that we did not support them in detail but were arguing for the principle of a democratic majority on boards of management. That is why it is important that when we consider terms of office, we ensure that appointed members are not allowed to exercise influence within a board of management in an undemocratic way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why did the hon. Gentleman feel it appropriate, in the context of the school boards legislation, to describe the parental majority as the tyranny of the majority and express grave reservations about it, if he now says that parental majority represents democratic control?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with that during our debate on clause 54, when the Minister asked exactly the same question. He can read my answer in <i>Hansard,</i> but to save him the bother I shall repeat it. School boards are different; they were set up with the idea that there would be ceiling powers. I argued on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill Committee that parental majority would be divisive because it would give parents huge areas of control over staff and other elements within the school, and would set parents against staff. However, the value of a school board was that, ultimately, it was funded and controlled by the education authority. Self-governed schools will be not under education authority control but under the direct control of the Minister, who is unaccountable to the Scottish people for the way in which he exercises his office. The context is different, so it is important that there is some form of democratic accountability between the board of management and the people whom it represents.<br><br>
The Minister made that point himself. He said that it did not matter what functions and powers were given to the boards of management because ultimately they would be accountable to the parents who elected them. That is what worries me about the appointed members and their terms of office. Not only are the people who are appointed or co-opted on to the boards of management unelected, but they can carry out functions which give them tremendous influence. The board of management might form a sub-committee to deal with one area of its powers such as, for example, fund raising, and that sub-committee could be entirely made up of appointed members who have never been elected. The sub-committee could then be given delegated powers to made decisions about how that money should be spent. That is very unhealthy.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will examine that and ensure that it would not be possible for boards of management to set up sub-committees made up entirely of non-elected members and to delegate significant functions to those sub-committees for them to carry out in a completely undemocratic manner. That was my worry when I spoke on amendments Nos. 54 and 40 and that is my worry here, too. At least the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood reduces the term of office which non-elected members can serve on a board of management to a much shorter period. That must be a step in the right direction, althought it is not everything that I would want in relation to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
powers and functions which are given to co-opted members.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. I know that he will accept it because otherwise the hon. Member for Eastwood would not have tabled it. There has doubtless been some backstairs agreement that the Minister will accept the amendment. I hope that he does because although the Opposition will oppose to the very end the concept of self-governing schools opting out of local authority control and setting themselves up in competition with all the other schools left under education authority control, if they are to exist they should at least be kept under some kind of democratic control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not like what he has just said to remain on the record. I assure him that I do not know whether the Minister will accept the amendment. Indeed, I dot no think that I have discussed it with him. I admitted that I had not thought up the amendment myself and that it was put forward by the Scottish Consumer Council and could have been tabled by any member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. Obviously I attributed to him much more influence than he in fact exercises in the Conservative party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that that shows that there is no discussion or co-operation between the Minister and his Back-Benchers on this matter? Are they perhaps at odds on these issues?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all free spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not go so far as to describe Conservative Members as free spirits. It shows that there is no co-ordination or strategy on the Conservative Benches. Conservative Members act entirely under their own steam. If this is a Scottish Consumer Council amendment, the Minister is likely to reject it because he is opposed to any Scottish organisation which tries to influence the work of this Committee. He is against trade unions, local authorities and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council. He is always moaning about groups which try to come between him and the parents and his beloved self-governing schools. I hope that for once he will listen to reason—the amendment is very reasonable.<br><br>
It is important to ensure that people who serve on the boards of management of self-governing schools in an undemocratic manner, in that they are not elected and are not accountable to the people, are at least limited to two-year or four-year period of office rather than five or seven years. The Minister argued that these co-opted members should be parents. The risk is that they could be parents of children in the third year and if they served for seven years their children would be long gone and they would have lost interest in the school but would still have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0236">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
considerable influence through their membership of the board of management. That would not be helpful.<br><br>
Co-opted members will have to represent those requiring special education or particular attention as well as the wider community interest. If they are not doing their job on the board to the satisfacton of parents they should be removed. Under the Bill, they could be on the board for as long as seven years and could exercise tremendous influence. That would not be very demoratic. The amendment would change that arrangement, and I hope that the Minister sees reason and accepts it.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. Norman Hogg <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood was suggested by the Scottish Consumer Council. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said that I was almost certain to accept the amendment because I had spoken to my hon. Friend the Minister for Eastwood about it, but I have not.<br><br>
The Scottish Consumer Council met me on Monday and we discussed its views on the Bill. I pay tribute to the Scottish Consumer Council and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, which have been of tremendous help to both sides of the Committee with advice on amendments. The hon. Member for Dundee, East also said that I almost certainly would not accept the amendment when I discovered that it was proposed by the Scottish Consumer Council. That was unworthy. My briefing says that I should resist the amendment, but I was so persuaded by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood that I began to wobble. The best that I can do, given that we are examining parental majorities, which has now been given a new dimension, is to consider my hon. Friend's arguments about the terms of office and appropriate break points for the co-opted members. I am happy to give my hon. Friend an undertaking to consider the amendment and the arguments for it and come back at a later stage with a conclusion which also reflects my earlier undertakings of the composition of the boards of management. Therefore, I hope that he will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment which has become more important following the Minister's earlier comments. The reflection that those comments cast on his undertaking of Thursday 23 March makes us more hesitant to accept this undertaking to consider these important points. He seems to be backtracking on the assurances he gave on 23 March because he said that the parental majority on a board of management was not to be democratically elected.<br><br>
I was in hospital at the time, but I took great care to read the report of the debate on 23 March. It is clear that the Opposition acknowledged the technical defects of their amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be right for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that I have gone back on my

undertaking. I am committed to consider the case for a parental majority. My earlier remarks were in respect of the amendment, which seemed to suggest that the Opposition did not wish us to deliver that commitment. The hon. Gentleman should not suggest that the Government will not try to reflect the wishes of the Committee, or at least those members of it who are clear about what their wishes are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can interpret the earlier amendment as ruling out a parental majority only if he thinks that a majority can only be achieved by the addition of co-opted members.<br><br>
On March 23, the Opposition made it clear that we wanted the democratic influence on the board of management to be decisive. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) acknowledged the technical problems of amendments Nos. 40 and 54. However, he concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"We want the Minister to ensure that the boards of management are controlled democratically. As the Bill is drafted, that will not be the case. Will the Minister reconsider the matter?"—<i>[Official REport, First Scottish Standing Committee.</i> 23 March 1989; c.270.]</p></blockquote>
We understood that the Minister was about to do that.<br><br>
Democratic control is important and that is why I support amendment No. 86. One of the dangers in the Bill as it stands is that co-opted and non-elected representatives on the board of management will have excessive power. We want to redress the balance and ensure that the democratic input is decisive. The Minister asked why that was not the Opposition's position on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, but on that, the problem was different. School boards are subservient to a directly elected body: the education authority. School boards, or the board of management of a self-governing school, should always be answerable to a democratic body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is a clear distinction between the school boards, which remain the preserve of the education authority, and the boards of self-governing schools, which are essentially being nationalised. We shall develop that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The key point is that school boards have remained under the control of directly elected education authorities. That democratic acccountability justifies the education authority's ultimate power over the boards. The power or ultimate veto of the new boards of management should also be under democratic control. We fear that such control is missing in the Bill as it stands. Amendment No. 86 is an important attempt to redress the balance between directly and non-directly elected members of the board of management.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am honoured that this modest amendment is attracting speeches of a considerably greater length than mine in proposing it. I am rather puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's argument because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0237">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
the amendment would make no difference to the balance of the board's membership.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would make no difference to the balance of membership, but it would make a difference to the balance of power between the directly and non-directly elected members because it would diminish the terms of office for non-directly members. If the Minister is going back on the assurance that we understood him to give on Thursday 23 March that the directly elected, democratic element on a board of management would be the decisive, majority element, it is important that we accept the amendment. We must also try in other ways to diminish the power and authority of the non-directly appointed members to ensure that the democratic voice is dominant, whether in the context of school boards where the education authority, which is elected by all members of the community, can claim to be the democratic voice or in the context of a board of management on which only the parental representatives will have the claim to legitimacy conferred by democratic election. Parental representatives must have the decisive voice because of their democratic mandate.<br><br>
Why would parents wish to alter the system of school boards? They elect directly the majority of members on school boards and, in another election, members of the education authority. That means that all the people who have a locus on a school board are in some way accountable to them as parents or as electors of the local council. It would be baffling if a parent were to give up what are in effect two votes over his "representatives" on a school board in exchange for a board of management on which his "representatives" were in a minority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech, but he must confine his remarks to the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, Mr. Hogg.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, this rather fine amendment would reduce the time that co-opted members would serve on a board. He mentioned that it would alter the balance of power. Power in a committee can be based on a number of factors, but if often depends on the time element. In the earlier stages of his membership a person might be less inclined to exercise his powers. Was that the point that my hon. Friend was trying to make? If so, will he develop if further?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are various ways in which power can gather round particular members of a committee because of its voting procedures. However, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, the tenure of office of individual members can be a key ingredient in determining their influence and power. Having been there much longer and gained more experience than the directly elected members of the committee, they might be able to use that experience to claim a greater right to influence within the community.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
When the directly elected members join a board of management for the first time after a fresh election, they will be finding their feet for a few weeks. The majority on the board of management will consist of people who have been there for one, two or three years more than them, and it is easy to imagine how those non-elected people will be able to run rings around the directly elected parental representatives. They will know the ins and outs of procedure and of the school—its finances and its problems—and will be aware of the background to issues that come before the board of management.<br><br>
The entitlement of the non-elected members of the board of management to a longer term of office must inevitably lead to their having even greater power and say over elected members. I say "even greater" because the very fact that elected members will be in a minority will already give greater weight to the non-elected members. A second weight comes in on the side of non-elected members with their longer term of office.<br><br>
The Minister is already going back on his assurance that he would consider ways of giving the democratic element the majority voice on a board of management. That assurance is what we took from the debate on Thursday 23 March. He is not saying that he has looked at it, that it is impossible and the technical details are too difficult; he seems to be ruling it out altogether. There is no way that the democratically elected members of a board of management are going to be the majority voice on that board. If that is the case, the amendment has even more force and urgency than before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman giving way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman had finished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman wanted to intervene. He may have seen on my face that I was coming to the end of my remarks. I thought that he might wish to respond to my point that the Minister's withdrawal of the assurances that we thought we had received makes his amendment all the more forceful and urgent in order to redress the imbalance of power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Where all members of the Committee have expressed their basic support for an amendment and the Minister has said that he is willing to go away and think again—presumably he would advise my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment—is one not left with the conclusion that only a filibuster can be taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must draw their own conclusions. As long as speeches are in order, they can be lengthy. The Chair can do nothing about that.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I seek your guidance on a matter of procedure. I understood that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) wanted to proceed to other matters, but I am delighted to have a debate on my amendment for as long as the Committee wishes. I intend to withdraw the amendment, but am I correct in thinking that if I seek to withdraw it and another hon. Member then speaks, the amendment cannot be withdrawn but must be negatived and cannot then be tabled on Report? If so, that presents my hon. Friend the Minister with a difficulty if he considers the amendment later in the light of Opposition Members' speeches and decides to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the hon. Members question is correct. However, if the amendment is withdrawn, there is no guarantee that it will be selected on Report, although it can be tabled. The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is entitled to address the Committee, although the Committee knows that he intends to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am grateful for your reply, but wish to clarify the matter. I am not objecting to the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) speaking for his customary hour and a half, as long as he does not accuse us of filibustering.<br><br>
If I ask leave to withdraw the amendment and another hon. Member subsequently speaks, I do not think that my amendment can be withdrawn; it must be agreed to or negatived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So that we do not all get confused, I shall deal with that point alone. The hon. Member's interpretation of the proceedings is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Am I also correct in thinking that if the amendment is negatived in Committee, it cannot be proposed on Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no such ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Committee is anxious to make progress and, as I am sympathetic to my hon. Friend's amendment, I shall accept it on condition that on Report, when we consider the matter overall, we take account of any points made in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our proceedings are becoming bizarre when, on a point of order, the Minister informs the mover of an amendment that he will accept the amendment. I have not the faintest idea how to rule on that, but I note what has been said. I am sure that Opposition Members will take account of the fact that the Government's intentions have been clearly spelt out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to take account of the Minister's assurances and expressions of sympathy with the principle of the amendment, were it not for the fact that he has gone against the assurances that we thought that he had extended on Thursday 23 March.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has the power to solve the problem. If he sits down, you, Mr. Hogg, can put the Question, we shall vote on the amendment, and the amendment might be carried. Whatever the Minister wishes to do is then irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I give the rulings, although I am always open to advice. The hon. Member is noted in the House for dishing out advice on a grand scale, but I advise on the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Will you confirm that if the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) were to resume his seat and no other member of the Committee were to rise in his place, you would put the Question? If the amendment were carried, the Minister's views would then be irrelevant, for we should have written the amendment into the Bill. Will you confirm that that is right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any notion that at any point in the Committee no hon. Member would wish to speak renders that question entirely hypothetical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In any case, the Minister was about to go on to say that he would accept the amendment, provided that the Committee also understood that he was not obliged to support it on Report. If we could have an assurance from the Minister that he will not table any further new amendments that would in any way diminish acceptance of this amendment, we might be able to progress faster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Hogg, that you were right to rebuke me for trying me to be helpful to the Committee on a point of order. Perhaps I can be helpful to the hon. Gentleman. I understand him to be in favour of the amendment. If he sits down, the Committee will be able to vote on the matter, and I shall support the amendment.<br><br>
There are wider issues concerning the composition of the board of management and the parental majorities, which I have undertaken to return to on Report. I simply wished to leave room for manoeuvre. In the light of the Committee's clear wish, and in order to make progress, I make that offer to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At other times I should be happy to give the Minister room for manoeuvre, but I fear that he has much undermined my confidence, and—I fear—the confidence of my hon. Friends, given his earlier remarks, which put a gloss on the assurance that we thought that we had received on Thursday 23 March.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment. I am still considering some of its ramifications. Therefore, I am grateful for what my hon. Friend has said to help me understand it better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will also have points to make in his speech, which will be as helpful to me as my points are enlightening and informative to him.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly floundering, and I should like to help. I appreciate his difficulties. His hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) told the press earlier today that he wanted a debate on clause 13, so the hon. Gentleman is clearly on instruction to keep talking any old rubbish so that the hon. Member for Fife, Central can talk about that clause on Tuesday morning. To save the hon. Gentleman from talking rubbish, perhaps I can make a long speech on the next group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not in my power to allow the hon. Gentleman to make long speeches, but in your power, Mr. Hogg. Certainly, I invite the hon. Gentleman to try to do so. I regret his reference to the amendment as "any old rubbish". It is an important amendment—one of the key amendments. I commend the hon. Member for Eastwood for having tabled it. It has grown in importance during today, a growth reflected by the increasing attention that the Committee is bringing to bear on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told the hon. Gentleman that, if the amendment was pressed to a Division at the end of our debate, he would vote for the amendment. I understand the hon. Gentleman to be suspicious that, on Report, the Minister might introduce his own amendment deleting this amendment. I should have thought that the Opposition would be delighted if such an eventuality were to occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would not be delighted, because we know the way in which Members of Parliament and the votes are stacked up. Despite the fact that we get the largest number of votes of any party in Scotland, we know that our view would be defeated in this House.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, may I ask the hon. Gentleman—and the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish)—why, believing that this was such an important amendment, they did not table a similar one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I freely accept that there are many matters that I consider important which I do not think of first. Sometimes my hon. Friends do—and sometimes, even Conservative Members. When they do, I am prepared to congratulate them for having thought of them and for having spoken to <i>ihem—[Interruption.]</i></span></p>

quarter of an hour ago, nearly all interventions have come from Conservative Members. I am not sure what is going on; indeed, I am not sure which amendment we are debating. Perhaps one of my hon. Friends would tell me, as I do not know how to vote.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I believe that our proceedings are becoming high farce. If I ever get the opportunity to do so, I shall withdraw the amendment.

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Main Question put accordingly and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 50, line 37, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"The member of staff shall have the right to be represented by a member of their professional association of trade union, a colleague or a friend at any hearing conducted by the board of management or any persons authorised under the articles of management".</p></blockquote>
This is a major amendment and I am sure that many of my hon. Friends have prepared long supportive speeches which will be in order and bring life to our debate by concentrating on key issues that I shall introduce.<br><br>
We value a debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Hogg, as you preside with a great deal of firmness and fairness. I sincerely hope that your fairness will be in evidence this afternoon, as I believe that it will be required, although I am not asking for total licence. We shall debate important clauses later this evening and possibly in the early hours of tomorrow morning.</span></p>

giving notice of his intention to conduct a filibuster. Have I interpreted his words correctly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should finally rule that there is no such thing as a filibuster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, for defending free speech in the hallowed Palace of Westminster.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to bring self-governing schools into line with agreed practices and procedures in the Scottish educational system. It suggest that a member of staff shall have the right to be represented by a member of a professional association or trade union, or by a colleague or friend, at any hearing conducted by a board of management. It is not an attempt, as the Minister might describe it, to involve vested interests in the defence of vested interests. The measure proposes to introduce a form of wide accountability and support in circumstances that may occur in the functions, activities or procedures of an opted-out school.<br><br>
A time-honoured custom and tradition built into both trade union procedures and the practices of many educational, industrial and political organisations is that the right to be heard shall be ensured. We want that right to be specified in schedule 1, we seek to go a little further with this eminently reasonable amendment. In the spirit of glasnost that emerges as the possibility of a long sitting looms larger, we may even find that Conservative Members will join us in supporting the amendment.<br><br>
We have tried to draw a distinction between the trade union aspect and the civil and individual liberties that relate to professional and non-professional activities in a school. The basic right to which I referred has been enjoyed by members of school staff for a long time. Disciplinary procedures can prove aggravating in any organisation, so we are keen to provide for circumstances that might arise in an opted-out school in which the procedures and safeguards that exist in the traditional education authority system and school framework do not apply.<br><br>
When a school is in the process of opting out, many difficult decisions will need to be made in relation to both professional and non-teaching staff. A debate earlier this week highlighted the growing threats to the staff of schools involved in moves to opt out.<br><br>
Each part of the Bill should be considered as part of a jigsaw. It is crucial to include the reference to that earlier debate. Our anxiety is about those whose conditions of service have already been worsened by the Government. We see in every walk of life in Scotland that the shadow of privatisation has meant poorer conditions, lower wages and less security. That reinforces the need for safeguards to be built into the Bill. The matter should not simply be re-examined by the Minister and his colleagues, even if they are willing to be supportive. It is elementary justice to identify that need.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
I mentioned the sensitive changes that would ensue in opted-out schools and the types of problems that could arise. Some members of staff might suffer grievances about wages and conditions of service. But we should also examine the human side. We should guard against developments that could affect the children's quality of life. I was interested to see a letter from the education committee of the Church of Scotland, which expressed concern about the Government's proposals. It considers the children's interests to be paramount. The proposals are laced with parents' concerns, but attack vested interests, trade unions, teachers and other professionals. We must remember that the children are the most important part of any school. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I appreciate the enthusiasm now being generated by what we see on the annunciator screen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did we hear the hon. Gentleman right? Did he say that he appreciates or supports what I have just seen on the annunicator screen?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is absolutely out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your judgment, Mr. Hogg, in such matters. I said "appreciate".<br><br>
The pupils are the centre of our attention; that, I think, is supported by Conservative Members. In the light of today's earlier debates, it is important to talk about the Church's contribution, which is relevant to the amendment. In the Government's ideological drive for privatisation, it should not be forgotten that schools are essentially about educating children. The Bill should contain safeguards to minimise antagonism, insensitivities and hostilities between members of staff and boards of management, and among parents, co-optees and representatives from the teaching profession. It is essential that the Bill should allow justice to be done and seen to be done. I am confident that such a safeguard will blunt the excessive edges of this nasty piece of legislation.<br><br>
If the Government are interested in natural justice, in the quest for accountability and in child-centred teaching, where the pupil is the key focus, they must take into consideration the functions of self-governing school boards. I knock on the head any suggestion by the Government that we are thinking only of trade unions. The Government should lift their horizons above the notional knockabout rhetoric.</span></p>
