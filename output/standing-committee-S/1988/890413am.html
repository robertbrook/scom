	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 7, line 31, leave out "twelve months" and insert "four years".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 35, in page 7, leave out lines 40 to 44.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a reasonably important amendment in which we seek to give some stability to a school which has had a ballot in relation to self-governing status. If another ballot could be held 12 months after, it could be disturbing and lead to instability, which would be bad for the teaching and for the general running of the school. We seek to prevent an annual attempt to change the organisation of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several issues emerge. A ballot could mean that every aspect of the school would be disrupted for a period. Teachers, parents and the pupils' education must be considered, as there will be instability during the ballot. Consequently, a lot of energy would be expended on the ballot process—energy which would be better earmarked for the school's proper purpose of educating children. To repeat such a process annually would not be in children's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the potential conflicts that would arise in a ballot that had been fiercely contested. They would be unsettling for the whole school, so a one-year lapse between ballots would not be healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know why 12 months was chosen, rather than a longer or shorter period. Is it likely that circumstances could dramatically change in the school, in the catchment area or in the way in which a local authority deals with a school in such a period? What would happen when a ballot had taken place in which there had been a narrow majority in favour of rejecting self-governing status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman expect that a considerable number of ballots will produce either a negative result in relation to opting out, or a low majority on a positive result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>602</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on that, because it is not germane to the issue. We are discussing a ballot that has been held and produced a narrow majority in favour of not opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make my point. I shall let you come back in a minute. Contain yourself—we have been sitting for only five minutes. I know that the programme is to get up and go early on, but if you bide your time you will be able to expend your energies later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should be careful about how he uses the word "you".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for that, Mr. Martin, and I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for whom the remarks were intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a ballot has been held and shown a narrow majority in favour of not proceeding with self-governing status, there will be enormous pressure with the school—possibly with assistance from the Government—for recurring ballots. Our amendment would give stability to a school, which is essentially concerned with education, and ensure that groups which felt dissatisfied with the result of the ballot could periodically seek to have the majority against opting out overturned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of my comments, I shall quote to the Committee the justification for the amendments by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When a proposal is made to ballot parents on self-governing status, the school will enter a period of uncertainty and apprehension, until a decision is reached by the Secretary of State, if the result of the ballot was in favour. This is unavoidable. If the result of the ballot was against the school becoming self-governing, a year is much too soon to allow a school to be thrown into that uncertainty again. Moreover, the composition of parents is unlikely to change significantly in one year and the ballot result is unlikely to be different from the previous one. The provision for an annual ballot of parents would be an unnecessary use of public resources, both in terms of finance and manpower."</p></blockquote>
The SPTC concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could trivialise the procedure."</p></blockquote>
This is a succinct complement to our comments about uncertainty and seeking to give stability to a school. Although we believe that the educational debate is of necessity about politics—it is about resources, priorities and the judgments that have to be made about pupils and parents—we would not welcome the politicisation of schools. It is in that spirit that we hope that a period of relative stability would always exist after a decision had been taken one way or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the general thinking behind our modest amendment. What constitutes a reasonable period of time is always a matter of judgment. The Government have specified 12 months; in our judgment, that is too short a period. Four years has been suggested as a period of relative stability, but that may not be appropriate either. The debate should focus on the principle of whether it is in the long or short-term interests of a school and, more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>603</span>
importantly, the pupils who are looking for an education, to have the opportunity to hold continual ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the length of time that a child is at school. A primary school may hold a fiercely contested ballot which shows only a small majority against self-governing status. Children are at primary school between the ages of five and 11 or 12. It would be a tragedy if, over a period of two or three years, the school was continually holding ballots on opting out, with the same arguments recurring and the possibility of interference in the ballot procedure, which we shall discuss later when we consider the excellent amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A ballot would cause uncertainty in a school, but if the debate were made more complex and intense by a widening of the battle nationally or regionally to involve the Government, organisations such as the grant-maintained trusts in England and local—I am not exonerating anyone—that would not be healthy for education in the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the amendment apply to ballots which result in a narrow majority not to opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one instance about which we are concerned. The hon.Gentleman has made a fair point. But the amendment might also apply to ballots which resulted in a decisive rejection of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Decisive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It covers the whole spectrum of possibilities. A continual debate on self-governing status is not in the interests of children at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interference by a wide variety of organisations would worsen an already delicate situation. I hope that the debate on the amendment will be about what constitutes a reasonable time rather than about the specific periods of the 12 months in the Bill, or four years, which some hon. Members may find inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the purposes of Standing Committees is the exercise of give and take to test arguments. We should all be prepared to give way when our arguments are challenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members never give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way now to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to say that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) has refused to give way to Opposition Members on several occasions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should not discuss that matter. The rules are clear. It is for the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>604</span>
who has the Floor to decide whether to give way. The hon. Gentleman should confine his remarks to amendment No. 36.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I am in an extremely contented mood this morning. I apologise to the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). I said that I would allow him to intervene further, but instead I allowed the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes to intervene. I apologise for that omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to assist the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) by giving the results of some research that I have undertaken. He made it clear that the amendment applies to ballots which result in either narrow or decisive majorities against opting out. When he answered my question—or rather did not answer it—he may not have been sure what the results might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 2 November and 20 February no less than 37 ballots were held by schools whose governing bodies had suggested that they should opt out. My research showed that the turnout was generally good. The lowest was 53 per cent, and the highest was an extraordinary 81 per cent.—far higher than most parliamentary elections, let alone local government elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure of 81 per cent, may be an underestimate, because a school in Tameside had a turnout of about 86 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the mistake. Looking at my list, I now see that in Park High in Lincoln there was a staggering turnout of 88 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the comments of the hon. Member for Fife, Central, it is interesting to note that of these 37 ballots, one had a 100 per cent, yes vote and on no occasion did the yes vote decline to less than 50 per cent. In 21 out of 37 ballots, the yes vote was over 80 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have been sent the results of the excellent research that we have been hearing about. They show that on one occasion the yes vote was extremely low. The hon. Gentleman may wish to put the Committee right on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to debate the matter with the hon. Gentleman, but the list shows that of 37 ballots, 21 had a yes vote of more than 80 per cent. As we live in a democracy, it is conceivable that in some such ballots there will be a low yes vote. I am not arguing about that. The statistics show that there was a remarkably high turnout and yes vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central tried to convey the impression that decisive or narrow majorities voting against opting out could create uncertainty and confusion, and that parents should not be given too regular an opportunity to exercise democracy. When we examine what happens in practice we see that, given the choice about their children's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>605</span>
education, parents invariably and decisively vote for more control to be given to parents, governing bodies and school boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments miss the essential point, which I conceded in the reply to the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). The amendment covers a wide variety of options in relation to what has happened in a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is the continual disruption that would ensue in a school, its area and its local authority if ballots took place time and again. So choice for parents must be balanced by the disruption that it may cause to pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is saying. His arguments are somewhat convoluted. No evidence suggests that there will be confusion. On the contrary, it suggests that when parents are given a choice, they vote only once, and vote decisively yes. So the amendment is simply not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. He seems to be saying that his research shows that in the majority of cases, parents decide decisively that they want to opt out. If so, why does he defend the Bill's provision that that decisive vote should be for annual re-balloting? Why not wait for four years before the parents and the school are subjected to the same process again? Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that a decisive vote is sufficient to be accepted for four years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to my original argument. The hon. Gentleman's question could be turned on its head. What is Labour party policy on those matters? Is it against parental choice? I have sat through many local government committees and know that annual elections are now official Labour party policy. From what Labour Members have said this morning, they now seem to think that annual elections are decisive, and could cause confusion. But democracy never causes confusion. Did not Winston Churchill once say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."</p></blockquote>
What do the Labour party really believe in? They repeatedly say in Committee, "We know best" and "Officials in the town hall know best."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman consider whether a school is about education or politicisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an extraordinary question to come from the Labour party. The Scottish education system was the envy of the world and was set up during the Reformation, on the basis of democracy, to give opportunities to the sons of crofters. The Labour party politicised it and forced the comprehensive system on Scottish education. The Labour party fiddled around with the system for political reasons. There is nothing about politicisation in the Bill; it aims to return rights and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>606</span>
powers to parents, so that they can decide what is best for their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that those parents' rights should include the right to exclude the children of other parents from schools on the grounds of general academic ability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to raise the old canard which we debated at length earlier. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that that is not the purpose of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman in favour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be delighted to debate at length the merits or demerits of selection on academic or other prowess, but we have already held that debate. This morning's debate concerns what is likely to happen in a ballot. Parents are intelligent enough to form their own views. Evidence shows that far from causing confusion, ballots give simple results. They result in a yes vote and, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman presented an interesting argument. He seems to suggest that the more decisive a result from a ballot, the more it should be open to question every year thereafter. He gave the example of 21 ballots where 80 per cent, or more voted in favour of opting out. That result is decisive. There is no point in arguing about it, because parents have obviously used their academic right to exercise their vote and choose to opt out. Why they choose that option is open to debate, but we should acknowledge the result. However, if 80 per cent, vote yes, 20 per cent, must vote no. It only requires 10 per cent, of parents of children in a school to initiate another ballot. The hon. Gentleman now concedes that whatever the result of a ballot about opting out, a ballot will take place every year, because those who are discontented with the result will wish to initiate another ballot the following year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the example on Tuesday evening where it would be possible in a school of 500 pupils for between 50 and 100 parents to initiate the ballot procedure whenever they wished. Whatever the result of the ballot, between 50 and 100 disgruntled parents can guarantee that there will be a ballot every year. That is what the Government have achieved. Even they must concede that it is not a healthy development for the education offered in such a school because, as my hon. Friend for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) pointed out, every year it would distract parents, teachers and pupils from the real business of the school. If the amendment is not accepted, there will be annual ballots in self-governing schools. I am in favour of annual ballots in Parliament because the Government would then have to acknowledge that they have no right to impose such legislation in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the majority that might be required to allow a school to opt out of education authority control. The legislation clearly states that a simple majority of the votes cast in the ballot is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>607</span>
sufficient, but it also states that it is the Secretary of State for Scotland who will decide whether the simple majority of votes cast is sufficient to justify the school being allowed to opt out. On the few occasions that the Secretary of State has turned up in Committee we have tried to press him to give us an idea of the standards that are likely to be applied. Will he accept a simple majority? If not, what percentage of the potential electorate will he accept?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to a senior figure in Scottish Homes who said that if 80 or 85 per cent, of tenants voted to decide whether to choose a private landlord, Scottish Homes might not accept as sufficient a vote of even 51 per cent, of the 85 per cent, in favour of a private landlord. We do not know what standards the Secretary of State for Scotland will apply. If he is keen that a particular school should opt out he might say that if only 51 per cent, of the 85 per cent, voted in favour, he will give the go-ahead for opting out because there is provision for annual ballots and the position could be retrieved next year if opinion within the school changed. That is a possibility, so perhaps the Minister is insisting on annual ballots to give the Secretary of State for Scotland greater freedom to allow minorities to take schools out of education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of a school with an electorate of 1,000 parents of which 85 per cent, or 850 vote in a ballot. If 51 per cent., or 426 of those who vote, want the school to opt out, the Secretary of State could consider that to be sufficient under the legislation even though only a minority voted in favour of opting out. Another ballot could be held next year.

We should ensure that ballots can be held only every four years to protect the education of the children and narrow the Secretary of State's scope to allow schools to opt out even on a minority vote. The amendment is not about politics or whether the Tory party can claim that X number of schools opted out and the Labour party can claim that X number of schools chose to remain under education authority control. It is about the education of children. Annual ballots will be inevitable under the Bill, so it is the Minister's responsibility to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments should be considered seriously in the spirit in which they have been tabled because we must consider what might happen after a decision has been taken. I draw the Committee's attention to a survey in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 6 April of the attitudes of a range of schools to opting out. The purpose of the amendments is to consider the position of schools which have had a ballot and have decided not to opt out, either by a splendid majority against or, as the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) described it, by a decisive majority.

The article, by Paul Marston, considers schools which choose to say no. Let us imagine that a school has held a ballot and there has been a decisive majority against opting out. The amendment would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>608</span>
prevent that school from having another opportunity to consider the issue for four years. However, the attitude of a school or of a group of parents to opting-out is not kept in isolation: if a school down the road chooses to opt out and its record changes, their attitude might change. The evidence for that comes not from me but from the survey of those schools which choose to say no. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 70 schools not considering opting out were asked if they would change their mind if a neighbour went grant-maintained. One quarter said they would, one third said they might".</p></blockquote>
If we passed the amendment we would be telling those schools which might want to reconsider their decision after seeing what happened when a neighbouring school opted out that they could not do so for another four years. As my hon. Friends and I have already pointed out this is rather like the sale of council houses which began with a slow trickle but eventually was like the breaching of the Aswan dam. The Labour party's policy on that issue had to change and it will have to change on this, too. Once one or two schools opt out the trickle of schools will become a flood. Opposition Members know that as well as we do which is why they are seeking to write in this amendment. I suspect that one or two of them have read this article. They have read that one quarter of schools which choose initially to say no would be prepared to change their mind if a neighbour went grant-maintained. They do not want any opportunity for a change of mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The more one looks at the facts and figures, the more one realises on just how few occasions there is the narrow majority for or against which the hon. Member for Fife, Central talked about. Incidentally, I made a mistake and I apologise for that; 19 of the schools voted yes by 80 per cent, or over. I said that it was 21 schools. Ten schools voted yes by 50 per cent, or over. Of the schools which voted no, only 2 voted no in the range of 50 per cent, to 60 per cent. The evidence shows that there are few occasions on which there is a closely fought result and the majority against is very narrow. The argument advanced by the hon. Member for Fife, Central was not based on fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have access to the same factual information as we do. I notice that the hon. Member for Fife, Central has left the Committee Room again. It is unfortunate that, after moving this serious amendment, the shadow spokesman is not present to hear our arguments. We are responding geniunely and seriously to him, using published, factual evidence on which to base our case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) says is absolutely true. According to the published data that is available to all members of the Committee, and on the basis of the evidence since 2 November last year, the scenario that the hon. Member for Fife, Central postulated when moving the amendment will not occur. Even if we concede the hon. Gentleman's case—as the Committee will know by now, I am a reasonable man—that there could be a narrow majority in one year, he is saying that we must

set in stone for four years the school's inability to reconsider, despite 	<i>The Daily Telegraph's</i> analysis that the school's decision would be affected by the decisions of neighbouring schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are willing to listen to alternative suggestions put forward by Conservative Members. Successive ballots year after year could result in much divisiveness and uncertainty in the schools so afflicted. The hon. Gentleman may not want to set in stone for four years a particular decision after a ballot, but does he not think that a midway point between four years and 12 months could be reasonable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least it is clear that the hon. Gentleman accepts that four years is unreasonable. I do not agree that what the hon. Gentleman suggests could happen. On the basis of what has happened so far, that is unlikely to happen. It is important for schools to have the opportunity of reconsidering their decision in the light of decisions that may have been taken by schools down the road. I draw to the attention of the Opposition the first paragraph of the article entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools who choose to say no".</p></blockquote>
That is why I oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the arguments of the hon. Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), but I come to a different conclusion. If, as they postulate, a ballot is decisive, that would allow the opportunity for stability and for the school to get on with its decision on whether to opt out. It is amusing to imagine those hon. Members going to their constituencies and discovering their party to be 2.5 percentage points behind the Labour party in a poll in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> To the call from some of their constituents for an immediate general election, they would say, "No, we must have time for our policies to get through to the electorate and then they will understand it." If Mrs. Thatcher had been subjected to a general election in 1981, two years after her election—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer to Members of Parliament by their surnames.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Prime Minister had been subjected to a general election in 1981, we would have heard no more of her. That was the nadir of her fortunes. She said that she wanted people to appreciate her policies and that she would gladly hold an election in 1983. If that is good enough for the Government, it is good enough for each and every school. If the Minister is reasonable, he will accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to quote the Scottish Parent Teacher Council because the Minister may have a surprise for us after meeting its representatives on Friday. However, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the results of a ballot of parents are against applying for self-governing status, then this must be accepted by all parties and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>610</span>
the school allowed to settle down to continue, without further disruption, the education of children in its care."</p></blockquote>
For some time I have argued that the Minister wishes to see instability in Scottish education. The fact that a ballot can be held every 12 months reinforces my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, 1,982 schools have rolls of fewer than 300 pupils. Ten per cent, of parents can petition for a ballot. That means that in those schools 12 to 15 disgruntled parents could petition for a ballot every year. That will lead to a rolling campaign because each ballot will take at least three months out of each year. There will just be a nine-month respite before another ballot is forced on the school. We want education to take place in a stable atmosphere, and that is in the interests of both parents and pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public resources and manpower will be spent every year to test whether a school wishes to opt out. Let us consider the impact of that on the staff. Many of them will be fearful enough at the thought of having to change from local authority to self-governing status because it may affect their conditions of service. A ballot will disrupt the work of the school and lower the morale and well-being of the staff. If they are subject to instability every year, I imagine that some of them would consider moving to other schools. The Minister should realise that schools produce their best results when there is stability and when the staff have been at the school for some time. They get to know the children and an understanding develops between parents, staff and children. That is how educational prosperity occurs. It is the same as in industry where progress is made when there is an understanding between employers and employees. A yearly ballot would diminish such an understanding by creating instability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes referred to a flood of other schools opting out. I imagine that the results in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> are correct, because people in education authority schools would see the instability in the proposed system. The staff would be worried and would wish to move, and prospective parents would be worried when they see that an opted-out school receives a special purpose grant. The Minister has the ace card when it comes to finance. He has not revealed his plans, but I suggest that finance and resources could also play a significant part in the decisions of parents. Prospective parents would not wish to subject their children to the vagaries of a system in which there is a rolling ballot every year because 12 to 15 parents want that. They want their children to attend a school where they can be sure of the stability of the education. The Government's proposed system will ultimately reduce choice, not enhance it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's tablets of stone decree that there shall be choice, but the Minister must think seriously about our amendment. If he is willing to listen to good arguments, he will amend the provision to at least every four years to protect education in Scotland and the children in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to a particular amendment. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman can read. He is not driving a wedge between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of our argument is that we do not want a yearly ballot. We want stability, unlike Conservative Members who want instability, which will wreck public education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments, especially those put by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), who pointed out that the amendment was suggested by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. Although he questioned the sanity of the council in our previous sitting, I am glad that the hon. Member for Fife, Central is again tabling its amendments and putting a case for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument to be put, but it can be substantiated only if the Committee believes that the council is in a better position than the parents and the school board to exercise common sense without knowing what may arise in the future. Of course, it would be undesirable to have a series of ballots on an annual basis. I should not expect a school board, or 10 per cent, of parents, to embark on such a procedure unless there were something seriously wrong in the school. It is difficult to imagine continual pressure for self-governing status being supported by the school board or by 10 per cent, of parents if something were not seriously amiss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a matter of judgment but, on balance, we believe that 12 months is a reasonable period between ballots. It is long enough for people to see a dramatic change in a school's circumstances— perhaps an education authority may change its policy on a closure proposal. If I accepted the amendment, a school might hold a ballot on self-governing status which was narrowly rejected, and a year later the education authority might propose to close the school. If I accepted amendment No. 36, the education authority could bring forward such proposals four years hence and the option of going for self-governing status would not be available. In some circumstances, that might be a matter of great regret to the parents concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To underline what my hon. Friend has said, may I again draw his attention to the findings by Paul Marston in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 6 April, which said that some 33 schools were encouraged to consider opting out because they wanted to escape from the political interference and a specific policy that was affecting that school from the local education authority. The amendment would prevent them from doing that for up to four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

is an interesting survey. It is significant that the hon. Member for Fife, Central did not disagree with any of the figures that my hon. Friend gave the Committee. Of course, that was because the hon. Gentleman was not in the Committee at the time. I have never served on a Standing Committee where the Front Bench has been abandoned in such a way. It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman was not here to hear the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is particularly unfortunate that the hon. Member for Fife, Central was not here when I gave some figures to the Committee. Let me repeat them. Of the 39 schools where ballots were held, 19 voted yes, with a majority of more than 80 per cent., and 10 voted yes with a majority of more than 50 per cent. Of the 10 schools which voted no, only two voted no by narrow margins. Therefore, the whole basis of the hon. Gentleman's speech was inaccurate—[Hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey is very interesting. It certainly changed my views on self-governing status in a way which I suspect the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) would not like. In the survey, 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> sent questionnaires to 600 schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Schools in England have an opportunity to apply for grant-maintained status— the equivalent of self-governing status. The hon. Member for Dundee, East wishes to deny schools in Scotland that opportunity, which is why he is opposing the Bill. We should consider the experience in England, because on this occasion England is the guinea pig, not Scotland. If it were the other way round, as happened with the community charge, no doubt the hon. Gentleman would say that Scotland was hard done by. But on this occasion we can see

the benefits which have been enjoyed by education in England, and see how that can enable us to make a judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not work. Keep it in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that we might as well keep it in England. At our previous sitting, I thought that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman's position was that proposals that applied in England should be applied across the board. The hon. Member for Fife, Central nods in agreement. The Education Reform Act 1988 allows for a ballot to be held every 12 months. It appears that the Labour party's argument varies daily. At our previous sitting, we were told that the Bill should be the same as the 1988 Act; today we are being told that it should be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give us the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the argument. First I shall respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out of 600 schools, replies were received from 213 from all regions of England and Wales. The schools were asked whether they were considering an application for grant-maintained status. Of those which replied, 143 answered yes and 70 said no. What puts a completely different complexion on our deliberations to date is the main reasons that schools gave for considering applying for self-governing status. Of the 143 schools which were considering applying, almost three fifths said that they were not facing a reorganisation proposal, such as a closure or change of status. The survey shows that most schools currently contemplating opting out of local authority control in England are attracted by the prospects of financial benefit and management autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, was even more dramatic. It concerned what was described in the article as the second wave schools—that is, schools which are in the neighbourhood of schools that have already applied for grant-maintained status, or whose applications have not yet reached the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons why schools are now considering self-governing status are interesting. For example, 33 of the total number of schools wish to escape from the political interference or bias of the education authority; 32 schools want managerial freedom and autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have argued that schools are interested in self-governing status only as an alternative to closure. The survey shows that that is incorrect. Even if we accepted that, we would not accept a provision that would prevent a self-governing status ballot from taking place. It is open to an education authority to put forward a proposal for closure at any time. If the time between ballots were extended to four years, schools would be vulnerable to closure by committing the cardinal sin of holding a ballot and perhaps failing narrowly to reach agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>614</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that most of the schools seeking grant-maintained status are doing so to flee the clutches of Conservative-controlled local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman thinks that he has trapped me into going against my argument. I highlighted from the article those schools that were complaining about political interference. It was interesting that they were slightly more likely to be controlled by Labour than Tory local authorities. Of the schools that were considering opting out, 39 per cent, were in Conservative-controlled local education authority areas and 36 per cent, were in Labour-controlled education authority areas. The hon. Member for Western Isles made our point for us. Schools should be able to reflect the interests of parents, and escape political interference from whichever side of the political division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of political interference, will the Minister reflect on the energetic campaign by the Grant Maintained Schools Trust in England to encourage schools to opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is going a little wide of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we accepted the amendment, which would prevent schools from considering self-governing status for four years after they had a ballot, the opportunities for the Grant Maintained Schools Trust to advise and help parents would be significantly reduced. As that is the Opposition's objective, we know that they are interested not in making the legislation work effectively, but in making it ineffective. They wish to deny parents the opportunity of choosing to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer next to the matter raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes and for Gainsborough and Horncastle. The second reason why schools are seeking grant-maintained status is that they believe that it will enable them to improve and provide a type of education that commands the support of parents. The amendment would prevent schools from taking account of developing circumstances. The arguments of Opposition Members about how continuing ballots will cause disruption reflect the view that parents will not operate with common sense in respect of the conduct of their children's schools. I am prepared to trust the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not think that it would be sensible for the Committee to accept amendment No. 35. It would remove an important escape clause whereby the Secretary of State may consent to a new ballot being held, notwithstanding the usual provision for a minimum period between ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be circumstances in which it would be right for such a ballot to be held. It would be intolerable if there was a strong demand from a school to ballot but it was time-barred from doing so and could not apply to the Secretary of State for a waiver. There could be circumstances in which there was doubt about the conduct of a ballot or about whether it was carried out properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister answered my question about yearly ballots by saying that it was difficult to imagine them happening, and that things would have to be seriously amiss. I do not believe that. The Minister has firm political views which he has held for years. If he is defeated on matters such as education, health and so on, he ensures that they are eventually adopted by introducing them year after year. I am sure that he has been knocking at the door of the Secretary of State for Scotland as much as he has been knocking at the doors of other Secretaries of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to parents who wanted the school to opt out, but what procedures are there to prevent their rolling campaign continuing? We want schools to have some stability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, a petition would be required, or the school board must take a decision to go for self-governing status. School boards will face elections every two years in the usual way under the Bill, which provides for rotation. There could be a narrow result in the ballot and a change in circumstances. If I were to accept the hon. Gentleman's advice, the opportunity for self-governing status would not be available to a school.

The hon. Member for Dumbarton says that I feel strongly about certain matters, which is true. I like
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>616</span>
to win. If a particular group disrupted a school in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman, it would find support for its proposals declining rather than increasing, which would be thoroughly counterproductive. The hon. Gentleman wants me to write into the legislation restrictions that would not allow the flexibility that is required. He wants that to wreck the Bill. He does not want the procedure to work effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perhaps out of line with his Front Bench spokesmen. In our last sitting, the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen freely admitted that they wanted to exclude primary schools on the basis that that would undermine the Bill.

I understand the arguments behind the amendment, but it would introduce an inflexibility which would deny opportunities. As my hon. Friends the Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes and for Gainsborough and Horncastle have rightly said, evidence based on experience south of the border shows that acceptance of the amendment would be a mistake, failing to assist the development of self-governing status if Scottish parents opted for it. I therefore ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that Conservative-held authorities in England and Wales will note the Minister's statement. Schools opting out are voting to get away from Conservative political interference and the imposition of uniformity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and other Conservative Members were unfair about my earlier intervention. When I inquired whether there was a mid-point between 12 months and four years that they would regard as a reasonable period during which a ballot could not be held, I was not saying that four years was unreasonable. I was simply seeking to provoke some appreciation from them that 12 months is too short a period. Indeed, when the Minister said that a succession of annual ballots on opting out would be undesirable in certain circumstances, he was conceding that 12 months is too short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were the chairman of a local education authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Heaven forbid!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>—and I disliked a school, what would I do if the hon. Gentleman's amendment were available? Knowing that a further ballot could not take place for another four years, it would be impossible to take into account new circumstances that arose early in that period. That is why the amendment is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the county of Humberside, for example, the chairman of the local education authority might announce that a certain school will close. A new set of circumstances would then arise. That would apply in Scotland, too. The amendment is unsatisfactory. Four, or even two, years is too long a period to cater for sudden changes of circumstance. A new local education authority might take control. A new Tory authority might be elected which threatens to take action that might be unpopular with parents, who might then suddenly want to take advantage of the opting-out procedures. Therefore, the period should be as short as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only example that the hon. Gentleman has provided of a circumstance that could radically alter the prospects of a school and require a quick response by parents is a threat of closure. If he is genuinely worried about that, a suitable, reasonable and constructive provision could be included in the Bill to make an exception for threatened closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman would not seriously suggest that the election of a new Tory education authority would be sufficient grounds for parents immediately to embark on a ballot without knowing the policies of that new education authority. After a year or two they might decide that the policies were not as bad as they had feared. So a minimum two-year waiting period would be reasonable. If he reflected on it, even the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes would agree with that. The only exception that he might still insist on would be the threat of closure, and that could be provided for in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some Tory authorities want to provide education on a medium to long-term basis and are against schools opting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to people fleeing from authority. Does he have in mind the article by Paul Marston in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 31 December which referred to Ravensbourne girls school having rejected opting out by 432 votes to 158 in a 59 per cent, poll? They were opposed by the education authority. One of the governors, Colin England, allegedly abused his position by writing to parents offering his services as an independent financial manager. Is that why parents want to flee from interference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a Tory-held education authority, and I shall leave it to the Minister to criticise such authorities for interference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>618</span>
I realise that speaking to an amendment after—or even before—the Minister has spoken can be a futile task. It may be doubly hard to get him to reflect on the matter after he has completed his remarks. Nevertheless, I shall throw in a couple of suggestions. We are worried about the disruption and uncertainty that would hang over a school if there were a succession of annual ballots. The Opposition would consider reasonable compromises from Conservative Members to cope with that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear to me that the hon. Member for Western Isles does not agree with the amendment. It is not for Conservative Members, who accept the Bill as it stands, to amend the Opposition's amendment. The hon. Gentleman suggests that he would happily support an amendment that specified two, not four, years and included a provision allowing an immediate ballot if closure were threatened. That is different from the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I detect a clear difference of opinion between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: there is a difference. But he is wrong to consider that an indication of my disagreement with the amendment as tabled. I am prepared to accept any compromise that the Government might suggest. Any improvement to the Bill, however small or marginal and wherever the credit may eventually lie—even if it is with the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes—is to be welcomed. The Bill as it stands is full of great dangers for the future of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the argument as it develops. I understand that Conservative Members are worried that it would not be possible to hold a ballot in exceptional circumstances. Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Government accepted the amendment they could amend clause 15 on fresh ballots and allow exceptional circumstances to be covered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed—not that I am keen to increase the powers of the Secretary of State any further than they have already been increased by the Bill. But if there was a choice between increasing the Secretary of State's powers and successive annual ballots, with their resulting disruption and uncertainty, that might be a reasonable suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now floating an entirely different proposal. He has picked up the point about giving powers to the Secretary of State. He now proposes an amendment which gives the Secretary of State the ability to agree an additional ballot within a fixed time. Why did not the hon. Gentleman table amendments on those two separate proposals so that the Committee had an opportunity to debate them? It is extraordinary to start arguing for alternative ways of doing things in the context of an amendment which he clearly finds unacceptable or thinks is unlikely to be accepted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>619</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that it is unlikely to be accepted by the Government is not a good reason not to table it. The Minister is wrong to think that I do not find the amendment acceptable. Given the way that the discussion has gone so far I recognise that it is unlikely to be accepted by the Government. I am raising, within the scope of the amendment, further possibilities, hoping that we might get some response from the Government. If the Government appreciate some of the concerns which the amendment tries to resolve, there is time between now and Report for them to table appropriate amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Setting aside the Government's selective amnesia, are we not seeking to be eminently reasonable this morning? The Government suggest 12 months and we suggest four years. We would like some debate and flexibility about what may be a better balance. Such flexibility has been injected into the debate this morning, and it is essentially what my hon. Friend is trying to achieve in this further debate, in view of the unreasonable position that the Minister has apparently adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. I hope that the Minister will not adopt an entirely negative attitude to the worries that have been voiced. I think that he appreciated some of those worries when he said that a succession of annual ballots would be undesirable and disruptive for the school concerned. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes said that some of the suggestions that I had put forward would make for a reasonable amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make the matter clear to the hon. Gentleman. For the reasons that I gave in my speech—which for some reason the Opposition Front Bench spokesmen were not prepared to hear, even though I gave them credit for raising a serious point—I believe that 12 months is the maximum period that should elapse. I pointed out that the hon. Gentleman takes a different view to that of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), as he thinks that the mention of a four-year period makes this a wrecking amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is still being unfair. I do not disagree with the amendment. However, given the response from Conservative Members, I am probing to see whether any other permutations of such an amendment would be acceptable to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that it would be acceptable to have a further ballot within a two-year period only if the Secretary of State gave his consent, he could table an amendment along such lines on Report, and make the case for it. However, he is floating a whole range of issues and expects my hon. Friends and I to table amendments to our own Bill, with which we are perfectly happy, or we would not have presented it for Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not expecting the Minister or Conservative Members to table these
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>620</span>
amendments themselves. However, I am seeking to find what Conservative Members might find acceptable in an amendment. If we then chose to table such an amendment, we could do so on Report in the reasonable hope of finding some support. Given that we do not often have the chance for cosy chats with the Minister about the Bill, this is probably the best forum for seeking to explore acceptable possibilities. Given that the gatling-gun of the Government's majority will be wheeled out at the various battle stages of the legislation, any improvements we can make to the Bill—however small, however incremental—are improvements that we would welcome. It would be helpful if the Minister could say whether he could consider such an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have to think twice about the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). One of the aspects of the Bill that I deplore is its increase in the Secretary of State's powers, but if it prevented the greater disadvantage of possibly successful annual ballots, I might consider it. I would welcome the Minister's thoughts on such an amendment. He also said that a succession of annual ballots would be desirable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said that a succession of annual ballots would be undesirable, perhaps he would consider on Report an amendment that contained the concerns dealt with in this amendment, but gave a figure for a number of ballots beyond which there would have to be a two or three-year hiatus before the next ballot. His final case was that if there were a succession of annual ballots, something would be amiss and there would be a strong demand for change. That is not so, because the succession of annual ballots could be called for by a succession of 10 per cent, of the parents. That is not indicative of any growing change or of any strong demand for change, but of a tiny minority of parents who insist on trying to get their own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is minded to reject the amendment, but nevertheless recognises the undesirability of having a succession of annual ballots, will he tell us whether he would consider it reasonable or acceptable for us to table on Report an amendment to get around the undesirable situation that he himself has laid out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr Macdonald) has made a fairly persuasive case for his position, but has not really made his position clear. He has floated a series of possibilities, one of which was that the Secretary of State should have a power to give his consent to a ballot within a defined period—which I think he suggested should be two years—where the circumstances merited it. Another was that the Secretary of State might not be involved, but the period would be two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) argued that the Secretary of State can already insist on a new ballot. That is not quite correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was insisting that the Secretary of State can order a ballot already; I said that something
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>621</span>
could be written into clause 15 to cover the concerns of the Minister and his hon. Friends. I do not want the Bill to go on to the statute book at all; I was simply trying to explain that the Secretary of State could intervene to cover the exceptional circumstances that would not be covered in a period of four years between ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 14(2), the Secretary of State can give consent to a request by 10 per cent, of the parents or the school board, where the circumstances justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having laid before the Committee the idea that the Secretary of State might give approval, the hon. Member for Western Isles then realised the contradiction in the position that he has taken— incorrectly—on the Secretary of State's powers. Most of the Secretary of State's powers under the Bill exist where something has gone wrong or where there is a conflict. They are not day-to-day, hands-on, management powers. The hon. Gentleman said that the powers of the Secretary of State should be limited, but he was floating the idea of giving him an additional power. In a perfectly honest way, he said to the Committee that he was not sure whether he would be happy with that because it contradicted his earlier position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wants to think about that and come back on Report with an amendment, we will consider it as we would consider any other amendment, but it is for the hon. Gentleman to work out what his position is. I am afraid that I am not going to listen to a series of arguments, and perhaps be overcome by the persuasive power of the hon. Gentleman—which is fairly strong—and then find myself being attacked by him for adding to the Secretary of State's powers. The hon. Gentleman needs to think about it, go away and perhaps come back on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) flew so many kites round so many hares that my hon. Friend the Minister may think that his speech was part of what 	<i>The Scotsman</i> described as the Labour party's new policy of line-by-line trench warfare. If that is true, Parliament may have to take matters in hand and impose a timetable motion so that we can debate those matters properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being unfair to the hon. Member for Western Isles. When he indulges in trench warfare, his speech lasts rather longer than the speech that he has just made. We may not have had a line-by-line analysis of that report, but there has been a certain amount of time-wasting and filibustering. If the Government decided to act as my hon. Friend suggests, the Opposition's conduct so far would make a convincing case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Western Isles wants to consider his position and come back on Report when he has decided what would be appropriate, we shall consider an amendment at that stage. I hope that he will also take account of my hon. Friend's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>622</span>
If he can devise an amendment that provides the necessary flexibility and adds to the protection, we shall consider it. I am sorry that he has been unable to table an amendment in the terms suggested in his speech. I cannot possibly recommend the present amendment, which calls for a four-year moratorium on ballots. The hon. Gentleman's speech showed that he recognises the reasons why I could not do so, and I hope that he will join us in opposing it and table a more reasonable amendment later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have said that we are trying to be reasonable. The Minister misrepresents my hon. Friend for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). It makes no sense to table a series of amendments that propose 12 months, 12 years, 50 years or whatever. The amendment proposes an alternative period of time. The essence of my comments, which has been reflected by my hon. Friends, is that we think that the 12 months adopted by the Minister is unreasonable. We have suggested four years. If the Minister is saying that he will consider further amendments at the appropriate stage, that is a positive step. We are not insisting that the specific time identified in the amendment must be adopted, but that 12 months would lead to tremendous instability in Scottish schools. If we can assume, however, that the Government are willing—as the Minister's remarks show—to consider a more flexible amendment, that will have a bearing on whether we push the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was giving no undertaking beyond those that I gave previously. I was saying to the hon. Member for Western Isles that he could table an amendment on Report. The hon. Member for Fife, Central is right that it would be ridiculous to table amendments with a series of timescales. The hon. Member for Western Isles introduced a new principle of the Secretary of State having the power to decide whether there should be another ballot. I should have thought that the hon. Member for Fife, Central would be opposed to that, but the idea could be discussed as another amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a fair point. My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles did allude to the possibility of the Secretary of State assuming such a power, and that is inconsistent with our overall views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our main concern is to avoid disruption and instability. We may discuss hypothetical examples and mention English experiences, but our clear concern, supported by several Scottish organisations, including the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, is that wherever possible we should build into legislation checks and safeguards that have children on the bottom line. That is not an idle comment. The Bill's impact will be assessed on what it does for the standards of excellence in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to be reasonable. The Minister has said that if we wish to table an amendment, which may contain reference to his ministerial powers or another timescale, it could be debated on Report. If he assures us that he would be willing to consider a further proposal, without him necessarily committing

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>623</span>
himself to accept it, I shall be willing to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for the Opposition to table amendments at a later stage, but whether they are selected for debate is not a matter for me. If an amendment of the type suggested by the hon. Member for Western Isles is tabled, I shall, of course, consider it. However, I make no further commitment because I shall need to know what the amendment contains and how it would meet the points made by my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for my hon. Friend the Minister, but if I saw such an amendment on Report, I should vote against it for the reasons that I outlined in my speech. It is essential to make the Bill as tight as possible and to keep the time limit between ballots short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend warned me that he was in Committee to prevent backsliding on my part. I may be backsliding a little now. However, he and my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) are right to say that there are important concerns regarding flexibility and that they should be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles is a clever man. He may be able to devise an amendment that meets the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes. If he can do that by Report, and if it is selected for debate, I shall consider it then. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, I am not prepared to say that I shall vote against the amendment until I see what it contains. However, it will be difficult to devise an amendment with the required flexibility. I leave it to the Opposition to decide how they wish to see the Bill amended, but I am happy to leave it as it stands and to keep it in line with the Education Reform Act 1988, as we were urged to do on earlier amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contributions made by the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) are always interesting. It is important to hear the official view of Back-Bench Members. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes perceived the Minister as backsliding. That is not my perception, but perhaps there are differences between us on what constitutes backsliding. We are in a difficult position. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes is honest because he, as the conscience of the far Right, has twice highlighted it when the Minister has suggested that he would consider the Opposition's reasonable amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many organisations feel strongly about the issue. It will be remiss of the Opposition not to press the amendment to a vote, if all the Minister can say is that it is up to the Opposition to devise an amendment and that, if it is selected on Report, he may or may not support it. That view was reinforced by the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes who said that he would vote against the amendment, regardless of its content, when it was submitted, and what it meant for the Scottish school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>624</span>
There is a dilemma. I do not wish to be pedantic about the problem. It will cost the Government nothing to vote the amendment down, but I cannot seek to withdraw it on the basis of the Minister's qualified assurances. In view of what we have heard, we shall push the amendment to a vote. Numerous organisations depend on a response to this matter and we have received no firm assurance that the amendment will be considered in a different form later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my job to help the hon. Gentleman, but is that course of action wise? Is he not denying himself the opportunity to return to the matter on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a clear point. That is the dilemma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a way round it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to hear the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes elsewhere in the House suggesting that he is the fount of all parliamentary wisdom. We are well aware of parliamentary procedure, but this is a test of the Minister's assurances, not a test of the Opposition. For example, on parental majority we now find that instead of an elected parental majority, which the Opposition were discussing, the Minister was talking about consideration of a parental majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not overwhelmed by the reassurances that we have received. The problem is whether to withdraw that amendment and hope to deal with a similar one later with no assurances from the Minister, or to vote on it now. The test on the public record and the test for Scottish public opinion will be on the measured response. We do not believe that we have received a measured response, and, therefore, intend to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave no commitment on the amendment, but I said to the hon. Member for Western Isles that if he devised an amendment to meet our concerns, we would consider it on Report. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes advised the hon. Member for Fife, Central correctly. I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman considers it necessary to push the amendment to a vote. He can easily withdraw it, and we can return to the matter later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We return to the essential dilemma, because the Minister gave more than a vague hint in his opening comments. He said that, in view of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles, he would be willing to consider another amendment, subject to its form. If the Minister will clarify what we will be able to do on Report, I will reconsider withdrawing the amendment. Will the Minister be specific about what we shall be able to do on Report and respond to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going nowhere. I am perfectly content with the Bill as drafted. My hon. Friend the

Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes obviously feels strongly about the matter. A series of speeches were made. I am giving no commitment to table another amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles raised a different proposition, which could be raised on Report. Whether he does so, is a matter for him. The hon. Member for Western Isles raised many possibilities and by pressing the amendment to a vote, the hon. Member for Fife, Central may prevent his hon. Friend from continuing a discussion in which he played an important part. I do not wish the hon. Member for Fife, Central to read into that that I should be favourably disposed to whatever the hon. Member for Western Isles proposes, because I do not know what that will be. During his speech, I counted at least four possible options, and he may want to consider other options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 104 refers to clause 14(6), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a ballot is held in respect of a school in accordance with this section, the Secretary of State shall pay, or reimburse the school board in respect of, the whole or any part of such expenses in respect of the ballot as appear to him to have been reasonably incurred by that board."</p></blockquote>
By including the key phrases
	<br><blockquote><p>"the whole or any part of"</p></blockquote>
and "appear to him", the subsection gives wide scope to the Secretary of State for Scotland to refuse to fund at least part of the expenses incurred by a school board in carrying out a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that all expenditure incurred by the school board in balloting parents would be met by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The amendment was suggested by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, which is much respected by the Minister. The council feels that school boards must be confident that the cost of holding a ballot of parents will be met in full, otherwise the conduct of the ballot may be compromised. If the school board were liable for any of the cost, it may be felt that the ballot was not conducted properly and did not give a true reflection of parental opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs involved in holding a ballot are set out in schedule 3. Each school board will be asked to make all the necessary arrangements for the ballot, which will be laid down by a body prescribed in regulations by the Secretary of State for Scotland. As the Secretary of State for Scotland will lay the regulations before the House, it is certain that a majority of hon. Members will support them. Can it be assumed that the Secretary of State for Scotland is not only responsible for the regulations but also for defining the prescribed body that will specify the arrangements? The arrangements must be in accordance with the guidance that the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>627</span>
State lays down. That means that the Secretary of State for Scotland is ultimately responsible for the arrangements for the ballot, so it is reasonable to expect him to fund the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3 also states that there must be a postal ballot of all parents. Therefore, when the Bill is enacted, that will be a statutory requirement and the board of management will have no choice. It must hold a postal ballot, and will incur expenditure, but it will simply be complying with statutory requirements laid down by the Secretary of State for Scotland. If he insists on a postal ballot, it is reasonable to expect him to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3 also sets out the information that boards of management must give parents before a ballot. They must give information about the ballot itself and about the procedure for acquiring self-governing status. The notes on clauses explain that boards may have to prepare for parents a summary of the relevant parts of the Act and specific information about the school. If 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 parents are involved, it will be an expensive exercise. If school boards are to meet the statutory requirements, they must be confident that they have the necessary funds. It is essential that it is made clear that the Secretary of State for Scotland will reimburse all expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule includes the phrase "as may be prescribed". At this stage, we do not know what the Secretary of State may prescribe that school boards must provide to parents. Further expenditure could be involved. It is important that the Secretary of State provides the money to carry out his instructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Besides requiring school boards to give information to the parents, schedule 3 also requires the school board to make the same information available to staff in the school. The information must be made available for inspection, free of charge. There is no way that the school board can recoup any money for that process. That is another cost that must be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Tuesday morning the Minister conceded that amendment No. 108, which we shall reach later, may meet the points raised about parents being given adequate information on the full consequences of applying for self-governing status. He said that amendment No. 108 would
	<br><blockquote><p>"probably meet the requests from my hon. Friends and from Opposition Members to ensure that proper information is available to parents in reaching a conclusion."—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 11 April 1989; C.498.]</p></blockquote>
The amendment would add to schedule 3(4)(a) the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"about the consequences for the school of acquisition of self-governing status as may reasonably be expected to enable him to form a proper judgement as to whether such status should be sought for the school."</p></blockquote>
That covers additional information and the Minister is likely to agree to that in the debate on amendment No. 108. Therefore, it is important that the money for making the additional information available is provided to the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the Minister will justify the inclusion in clause 14(b) of the phrases
	<br><blockquote><p>"the whole or any part of</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>628</span>
and "appear to him" on the basis of schedule 3(6), which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to section 14 of this Act, and to the foregoing provisions of this Schedule, the arrangements shall be such as the school board thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
That gives some scope to the school board, but for the life of me, I cannot see what kind of scope. The Minister may say that he will not commit the Secretary of State for Scotland to meeting the whole expenditure of the ballot procedure. If so, will the Minister tell us what kind of expenditure he imagines a school board may incur which it would not be justified for the Secretary of State to cover and for which the school would have to find its own means of funding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard this morning that it is not for us on the Committee to tell parents or their elected representatives on school boards or boards or management how to conduct their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the democratic procedure is strictly adhered to and that people take a decision about self-governing status on the basis of the fullest possible information being made available. We have to guarantee that there is funding to allow that to happen. Under clause 14(6) as drafted, that is not the case. The Secretary of State has the option of refusing to cover at least part of the expenditure. While there is that uncertainty, school boards may be concerned about making this or that information available, because the Secretary of State could say that he is not prepared to fund the provision of the information. On that basis, school boards would be liable for the expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want that to happen. We want to ensure that people vote on the basis of all the available information. If the Minister believes that information should not be given to parents before they make a decision on opting out, he must tell us what it is and why it would be unjustified for the Secretary of State to fund the expenditure necessary to make such information available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 189. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) made a constructive and interesting speech. I support his view that the democratic process should go through unimpeded. I hope that all members of the Committee agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether amendments Nos. 104 and 105 would improve the situation. I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say about the conditions that the Secretary of State will think fit. I wondered about that when I read clause 14(7) which amendment No. 105 would remove. I am sure that the provisions is included to remove any "funnies". I hope so. If not, I expect the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who gave his full and unqualified support to the democratic process, to support amendment No. 189. I acknowledge that it is a probing amendment. My hon. Friend the Minister will probably tell me that it is flawed, but the intention behind it is important. It is supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood whom the Scottish media and probably the Labour party think tabled it. However, the amendment was put

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>629</span>
down in my own handwriting as were the others that stand in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to protect the basic principle that the democratic process must be unimpeded. The parents and the school boards must have the freedom to act without fear or intimidation. The Committee might wonder why I stress fear and intimidation. The hon. Member for Dundee, East made my case for me. I understand that he has had to leave to vote in another Committee. I am sorry that he cannot hear what I am saying but I am sure that he will read it and agree with me. He stressed how important it was that the school board should not have to face the costs that would be required in carrying out its legitimate statutory duties. That was my fear when I read the clause as drafted. What would happen if the local authority were opposed to the school board's ballot and threatened the board with vexatious litigation? It would be an impediment to the democratic process if the authority threatened the board with legal costs. The local authority should understand at the outset that if it indulges in such intimidation, it will have to pick up the costs of the school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept the principle of the amendment if he cannot accept the detail. If it were accepted it would be an effective deterrent—it will surprise neither the Opposition nor my hon. Friends that I support deterrents— and would prevent the threat of massive legal costs. However, the disruption of the democratic process could be even more important than the threat of legal costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when my hon. Friend the Minister replies he will note the speeches made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East and I, which are not dissimilar. We are both concerned that the democratic process should continue unimpeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps what I am about to say will prove the advantage of having hon. Members representing English constituencies on the Committee. Examples of what my hon. Friend described have occurred in England in the past few months. I draw to his attention the cases of Audenshaw high school in Tameside, the London Nautical school in the Inner London education authority, Wellfield school in Durham and Small Heath school in Birmingham. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to persuade the Minister that there are problems in England that we do not wish to see in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention. I had no idea that there were such cases pending when I tabled the amendments. Based on the record of the past 10 years, ordinary people have been intimidated by local authorities in many different ways. We have had to introduce legislation to deal with that. That was news to me and I was glad to hear about it. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will now consider fully my remarks and accept that we must protect school boards against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
the fear of possible legal costs as a result of such intimidation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will know that amendment No. 104 was suggested by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council. The SPTC argued that school boards must be confident that the costs of holding a ballot will be met in full by the Secretary of State. I assure the Committee that that was our intention in the Bill. However, after again scrutinising our drafting, I agree that the Bill leaves it open to the Secretary of State to decide to pay something that might be less than the reasonable expenses of the board. Our intention is that he should pay its entire expense, provided that he is satisfied that the costs are reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not do that job technically, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall table an amendment on Report that would deal with the matter. As the Secretary of State will be disbursing public funds, he should be entitled to be the first judge of whether the expenses are reasonable. The amendment would leave it unclear about who would decide what is reasonable expenditure. That lack of clarity could leave room for dispute, where there should not be any. If the Secretary of State were challenged on his decision about what is reasonable, a remedy must be sought in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect that a significant dispute will arise. A school board will not usually incur expenditure on the conduct of the ballot, as we are providing in schedule 3 that all the necessary arrangements will be made by a prescribed body. A later amendment— No. 106—inspired by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities refers to that provision. We have in mind that the prescribed organisation would be one such as the Electoral Reform Society. In practice, the organisation's invoice for its expenses would probably be submitted direct to the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be able to attach conditions to the payment—a power that amendment No. 105 would remove—to ensure that the details of, for example, the ballot paper's layout could be standardised and acceptable to the Secretary of State. The amendment is useful, and if the hon. Member for Dundee, East withdraws it, I shall come back with an amendment which would have the same effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment of my hon. Friend for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) identifies one way in which a school board could be vulnerable. I hope that we never see a board subjected to the attacks that have occurred south of the border. We must ensure that boards are given every possible legal protection against such tactics. It is not clear in the Bill that a school board could rely on having its legal expenses met if it were subject to legal proceedings arising from the ballot. It is essential for school boards to have that security. I agree that it is right for the education authority to meet those expenses. If an education authority vexatiously took legal action against a school board simply to block and obstruct what that board tried to do, it is right that that authority should bear the costs of such action and answer to its auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>631</span>
The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North is perhaps too narrowly drawn. Under section 17 of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 the education authority must determine for each school board for each year an allocation of money to meet administrative expenses, the expenses of training members of the board, and other outgoings, and for carrying out any functions delegated to the board under the 1988 Act. There could be uncertainty as to whether any incidental expenses incurred by a board, for instance in preparing proposals for self-governing status under the Bill, could properly be met from the funds available to it by the education authority under the 1988 Act. Some of the expenses, especially those in connection with holding the ballot, will be met by the Secretary of State, under the provision of clause 14(16). There is a later amendment, No. 192, proposing that the Secretary of State should also meet the expenses of publication. Usually, those would be the only expenses incurred by a board in the early stages of the opting-out process. But apart from these it would be proper that the education authority should be placed under an obligation to pay for all the board's properly incurred expenditure under this legislation, and if my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment, I undertake to table one which would embrace what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Tayside, North referred to the wider issue of disruptive tactics by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify what expenses a local education authority is entitled to incur in its attempts to oppose a school opting out? My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) referred to the rights of the little man against the big bureaucratic battalion of an education authority that may be completely out of touch with what the school wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am determined that the legitimate wishes of Scottish parents will not be thwarted or frustrated by local authorities through the chicanery, intimidation and unfair tactics that we have read about in the newpapers and which have been hinted at this morning. When a school is considering opting out, there will be different views that must find expression. We want to see the issues being thrashed out in a fair and open discussion, so that the voters can take informed decisions. Above all, voters should be able to make free decisions. They must not be manipulated by campaigns of misinformation, cowed by threats or frustrated by procedural trickery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) that my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North has tabled amendment No. 190, referring to the conduct of local authorities, for later consideration. That will be the appropriate time to discuss such matters. I think that I have given the Committee my clear views on that matter. Vexatious litigation is a matter that will be covered in the amendment that I shall table later. I ask the Opposition to withdraw their amendment on the basis that I shall bring forward proposals to meet it and the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to make it clear that I take very seriously the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I base my view on what has happened in English schools and, as my hon. Friend said, we might be able to make a contribution in that respect. On a number of occasions, local authorities have used their considerable powers and legal back-up to intimidate governing bodies. I have a description of the sort of questions put to governing bodies. For example, they are asked
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the governing body have been properly constituted; whether the parental petition has been properly 'received' by the governors; whether teacher governors should have participated in the discussions; the nature of 'consultation' with the LEA"</p></blockquote>
and so on. It may be that those questions are all good in themselves, but when they are all taken together and pursued in a vindictive and intimidatory fashion, that is a serious matter. Therefore, I consider that my hon. Friend's amendment is important. We have a situation in which lay people are up against professional bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's intervention was rather lengthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I had intended to make a speech, but I was forestalled by my hon. Friend the Minister so I have made it by way of an intervention. I hope that I have made my point and impression on my hon. Friend the importance that I attach to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and, as I have said, I accept the principle behind the amendment of my hon. Friend for Tayside, North. The problem with his amendment is that it does not go far enough. He may find himself in an unusual position in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the commitment that I am giving to the Committee is to go rather further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) will have his opportunity to make his points under amendment No. 190, which seems to go rather further than would be wise. However, the Committee will discuss that when the amendment is open for debate. As for giving members of school boards the security of knowing that they will not be open to vexatious litigation, legal challenge or concerns about funding, my hon. Friend is on to a serious point. He is right to point to the experience south of the border and we should learn from it. I will bring forward amendments to meet that. The amendment of my hon. Friend was grouped with amendment No. 104, and I ask the Opposition to withdraw their amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his commitment that the Secretary of State will meet the full cost of a ballot carried out by school boards. I understand that the amendment needs some technical tidying-up to ensure that the Secretary of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>633</span>
State for Scotland will be given the first option to decide whether the expenditure has been reasonable; that is fair. When the Minister brings forward his amendment on Report we shall be looking for an assurance that if members of the school board or anyone else believed that the first decision of the Secretary of State was not reasonable, they would have access to an easy means of appeal against it. On that basis, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee. I was heartened and encouraged by what my hon. Friend the Minister said. I am in the unique position of not having gone far enough—that must be a record. I am happy with the commitment that he has given and I look forward to the opportunity to study the amendment that he tables which will go further than mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to comment on amendment No. 189. It is important that we put it on the record that Opposition Members are not fooled in any way by the linkage between amendments Nos. 189 and 190.1 take the point that we shall debate who is putting pressure on whom when we consider amendment No. 190.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means. If he supports an amendment to provide boards with the funds to carry out their duties under the legislation, he should support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). That provides for the boards' legal expenses to be met just as the amendment of the hon. Member for Dundee, East provides that expenses incurred to carry out a ballot should be met. If the hon. Gentleman supports the principle of his amendment, he should agree to that of my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point. I understand the procedures of the House but it is a pity that the two amendments cannot be discussed together. They are part and parcel of a similar process. I respect the contributions of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). When we have debated employment measures, trivial or vexatious legislation has often been mentioned, and I take the Minister's point about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that the amendment did not go far enough. It is wide-ranging, but no organisation should be given a blank cheque to cover legal expenses for unspecified situations that may or may not develop. I hope that when the Minister reconsiders the amendment, he will accept that it is widely drawn. However, I accept that it does not go far enough. Therefore, I hope a balance can be achieved. My comments about pressure and conflict can best be left until this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes a blank cheque must be given. In one case the governors of a school were required by the provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 to conduct a ballot. The local education authority went to the courts and imposed an injunction on the board of governors. To carry out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>634</span>
their duties under the 1988 Act, the governors would have to go to the court and pay the legal expenses of arguing the case that they were simply acting in accordance with the statute. Someone would have to pick up their legal bill and who knows what that might be. So inevitably a blank cheque must be given. Therefore, the terms, if not the wording, of the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone is required by law to carry out a statutory duty and for vexatious reasons an injunction is placed on him, the only way to get the injunction lifted is by going to court, which requires unlimited expenditure that someone must pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the motive for such an injunction would always be vexatious? Might there not be cases where a local education authority is reasonably pointing out to a school board that it is not conducting a ballot or its affairs properly? The authority might be defending the wider interests of the parents in the community. Should it be expected to pay in those cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than determining right or wrong, the issuing of an injunction means that the matter has to be decided by a court. Of course I accept that the court should decide whether the injunction should be lifted. Someone has to defend his action and say, "I might have got it wrong but I thought I was acting in accordance with the law. The law requires me to do something, and I thought I was doing it correctly." Somebody has to pay the cost. I accept that the determining factor is not the issuing of the injunction but whether the injunction is contested and what the outcome in the High Court will ultimately be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, it is obvious beyond all reasonable doubt that someone has to pay substantial costs. If I, as the chairman of a board of governors, receive a petition from the parents—whom I assume form 10 per cent.—and act in accordance with the provisions of the statute and am challenged, I shall have to defend my action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister right to highlight the fact that the amendment is widely drawn? A blank cheque in public life should never be guaranteed to any organisation. The provision is widely drawn, and I have some doubt about the comments that it does not go far enough. It has to be tightened up in relation to what may or may not be the basis for legal action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that it is probably difficult for my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North to get this detailed matter right in this amendment. My hon. Friend the Minister will want to be guided by the technical advice available to him before he includes the provision in the Bill. However, the general principle put by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North has to be right. In England experience shows that injunctions have been served so far for vexatious reasons, which suggests a weakness in the English legislation and a need to be more specific in the Scottish legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a danger that when one gets involved in detail, one is liable to be deflected from the principle, which is that no one who serves on a school board should be intimidated by the threat or actuality of litigation? I see it not as writing a blank cheque but as preserving the democratic rights and freedoms in that people should not be influenced by the fact that court costs are always expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The average school governor will not be a wealthy person and should not be put in a position where he or she might be liable personally for legal costs. A public authority has to be responsible for the costs that would flow from such actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has been making a distinction in respect of the point made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) between resources for defending an action and resources for taking an action, which are clearly distinct. There might be legitimate room for concern over the latter issue. However, my hon. Friend is concerned about boards defending themselves against action in carrying out their duties under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that point. We are seeking to give a simple protection to someone who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>636</span>
has had an injunction served on him, and has to defend his action, having assumed that he was acting under the requirements of the statute. For those reasons, the amendment, or the redrafted amendment, has to be accepted. I am glad that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would assume that any board of management would be exercising its powers under the guidance of the Secretary of State. Would he be able to advise the board of management whether it would be worthwhile defending the issue in court? He will have an army of civil servants behind him who will be able to tell him that he is wrong and that he should not oppose the injunction. That should be the safety net.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, it does not work that way. In any case in England, the local authority was so adamant that the parents should not be given the opportunity of expressing their views in the ballot—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
