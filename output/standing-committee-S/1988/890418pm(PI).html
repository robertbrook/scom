	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 191, in page 8, line 43, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) It shall be the duty of the education authority—
	<ol>
	<li>to provide the school board with such information as the board may require to assist it in preparing the proposals; and</li>
	<li>to meet expenses reasonably incurred by the board in pursuance of its duties under subsection (2) above.</li></ol>
(2AA) It shall be the duty of the head teacher to assist the school board in the discharge of their duties under subsection (2) above.".—[	<i>Mr. Bill Walker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking Government amendment No. 192.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was commenting on the press reports on Strathclyde's most recent initiative on decentralising responsibilities and studying the quality of their service. I also stated that I would see the director of education of Strathclyde, Mr. Frank Pignatelli.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting feature of the discussion was the concept of a major education authority seeking to move into the 1990s with a structure that can deliver on the strategic issues of education and be more responsive and sensitive to what is happening in local communities in Strathclyde. The director of education's comments on the scale and complexity of the education service justified the approach of both side's of the House in congratulation Strathclyde on moving ahead with such imagination and enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inlogov report was prepared by Professor Ranson who is eminent in his field. It tackles seriously some of the structural problems. Strathclyde regional council is also devising an implementation policy that will develop the issues over the next two to three years in consultation with a significant number of organisations there. The basis of the Inlogov study emerged from an exercise undertaken in Strathclyde where at least 400 consultations were carried out with many people who have direct, practical interest in the quality and delivery of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
service. After the initial consultation process, it was then thought important that a professional group, funded by the authority, should produce the study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no difficulty welcoming the initiative on the key issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman now able to tell the Committee whether he supports financial delegation to school boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question was asked earlier. Hon. Members who are not blinded by political opportunism will appreciate that I have dealt with the major structural implications of the Strathclyde Study and the Inlogov material. If we decided to comment in Committee on every remark attributed to Members of Parliament or council leaders, we would not make much progress. There would be few debates in this Committee on comments made by the chairman of a Conservative education committee in Scotland, as they are difficult to find.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point about Conservative chairmen, but the largest education authority in Scotland, responsible for half the children and half the schools there, has committed itself to financial delegation. Does the hon. Gentleman support that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLiesh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that when comments are made by an individual, whether he is an eminent council leader or just a humble councillor, it is not for me to trivialise those comments and play politics with the issues at stake, as Conservative Members are doing. They can continue asking. This morning we were treated to the light entertainment of the hard Right, aided and abetted by Conservative Front-Bench Members. If we are to take Scottish education seriously—I am not sure whether the Government seek to do that—we should realise that Strathclyde has taken a major initiative to improve its service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the structural issues raised by the Inlogov study. Conservative Members can get animated and agitated, but they will not move me towards commenting on remarks made at a press conference about school boards and that study.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right not to comment on odd remarks that have been made. However, we have been told—the press report may be wrong—that financial powers for individual schools, including the delegation of budgets, is a central part of the proposals. Is the hon. Gentleman refusing to say whether the Labour party agrees with such a proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is right to ask that, but I was shifting ground from what the hon. Member for Fife, Central would say about the issue, and what the Labour party would say. It is a bit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
tortuous to pose questions in relation to comments that are reported by the press—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. The hon. Gentleman should be allowed to make his contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot apologise for Conservative Members getting upset about the press coverage that we have had. It is instructive of their dilemma; indeed, it is interesting to note that there are no Government press advisers in attendance this afternoon. Perhaps they have other interesting things to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall meet the chairman of Strathclyde education committee, Councillor Malcolm Green, and the leader of Strathclyde regional council later this week. I shall be happy to provide Conservative Members with a report of that meeting for the benefit of education and political common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have agreed with Mr. Pignatelli to obtain copies of the report for all members of the Committee. I hope that we can then have a constructive debate on what the report said, not necessarily what the newpapers reported as the comments of various members of Strathclyde regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting, if not astonishing, attempt by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to extricate himself from the difficulties in which he found himself this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of the press release put out by Strathclyde regional council. My amendment calls for the education authority to provide such information as the board may require. There was much hilarity on the Opposition Benches when I suggested that part of that information might be financial. Yet the press release refers to establishing
	<br><blockquote><p>"local financial management as a cornerstone of the plan".</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is an essential element in the plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recall that our objection was not to the idea that financial information should not be made available to boards of management, but that it should be put forward in an amendment to clause 16 which dealt with the proposals and did not necessitate any financial information being made available in that context? If the hon. Gentleman peruses the Bill to find a more appropriate place than clause 16 for the amendment, we shall consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always appropriate if an amendment discomfits the Opposition. Although the Labour party in local government in Scotland, which covers the vast majority of Scottish children, has made clear proposals, the Labour party in Parliament is unable to endorse the plans and give them its backing. This is the right place for the amendment. There could be no better place to have it— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must have some calm in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Dundee, East that I did not collude in any way with Strathclyde regional council to move the amendment or to speak to their proposals. I am not in the pay of, or any part of, any lobby from Strathclyde regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to know a great deal about Strathclyde regional council's proposals. Do they parallel exactly the kind of proposals for the delegation of financial matters in the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They go further than those proposals. [Hon. Members: "How?"] Do Opposition Members wish me to speak for the rest of the afternoon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be accused by the Chair of filibustering on my amendment. However, as Opposition Members are so keen for me to speak, I shall do so in later debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fortunate that I have in my hand the press release from Strathclyde regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I allowed the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) some leeway, because almost every Conservative Member who spoke asked him to make a statement about Strathclyde. But we must get back to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for that, Mr. Martin. I have in front of me an article that appeared in 	<i>The Observer</i> on Sunday, entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Members who lobby in their own interest".</p></blockquote>
I was deeply concerned because of speaking to my amendment about information that the board will require in preparing its proposals and the duty of the head teacher. I did not want anyone to think that I had colluded with Strathclyde regional council to put out its press release yesterday evening so that it could be in today's Scottish newspapers and my colleagues and I could speak to the amendment today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make that clear because charges in the national press suggest that somehow there is collusion. In fact, I knew nothing of this article until it was drawn to my attention by Opposition Members. I photocopied it because of the suggestion that Conservative Members may be in the pay of or acting in the interests of the council. I make it quite clear that there is no link between Strathclyde regional council and me, but I welcome the fact that it has put forward this proposal which goes much further than the proposal in the School Boards (Scotland) Act which we debated at great length during its Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also draw the Committee's attention to the newspaper report in which some Scottish Tory Members were branded as unprincipled liars. I make it clear that I am not in the pay of Strathclyde regional council. Furthermore I refute what Ronnie Webster, the president of the STUC, said when he slammed Tory handling of Scottish affairs. He said that it was in the field of education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members know that we conduct our business by speaking to the amendments before us. It is the hon. Member's amendment that is before us at present so he at least should know its contents. I hope that he will start to address his remarks to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that I can clarify my position, I am in order if I defend my reasons for tabling the amendments and say why I wanted my hon. Friend the Minister to consider them seriously. I pointed out that there was no link between Strathclyde regional council and myself, although its press release helped me to speak up the amendments. I also want you to make it clear, Mr. Martin, that no charges can be levelled against me, on the amendments, of being an unprincipled liar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no control over what people outside the Committee say about the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I assure him that no such accusation has been made in the Committee. We can take it that no one would suggest that about the hon. Member, so there is no need to labour the point. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for your comments, Mr. Martin. They are welcome and I am sure that they will be endorsed by all Opposition Members. At no time have I charged them with levelling such accusations against me or any of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate. It has flushed out the differences between the Labour Front Bench and Strathclyde regional council. Because of the assurances that I have received from my hon. Friend the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 165, in page 9, leave out line 11</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 113, in page 9, line 11, at end insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>"including arrangements for giving priority to the admission of pupils residing in the delineated area, if any, of the school".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 114, in page 9, line 13, after "school", insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the number and ages, abilities and aptitudes and any special educational needs of pupils attending the school and the wishes of parents of those pupils".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 166, in page 9, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iv) the present arrangements for admission of pupils to the school.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 132, in page 9, line 25, leave out "if any".</p>
	<p>No. 146, in page 9, leave out lines 27 and 28 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) specifying the arrangements whereby pupils are admitted to the school; only in relation to pupils with special educational needs, may such arrangements be by reference to ability or aptitude.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 151, in schedule 5, page 55, leave out lines 22 to 24.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our debate we shall return to areas that have been discussed in relation to clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
2 and reference will be made to clause 28 because this group of amendments does not relate only to the clause and the identification of characteristics that will be included in the scheme of management. Those characteristics can be amended at a later stage through ballots of parents. We have four major concerns about clause 16, particularly in relation to subsections (3) and (4). Subsection (3) provides for proposals that must be included in the scheme and subsection (4) provides for a description of the school at the date of publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point concerns the suggestion in the clause of ability and aptitude. In a previous debate, there was some discussion over the semantics of what constituted ability and aptitude. We are arguing that the concept of academic selection for admission to Scottish schools was objectionable, and the ministerial response was to widen the debate to include a definition of giftedness. The concept of giftedness is the subject of a paper that was given to the Scottish Education Department some years ago, and I shall return to it. Therefore, our first major concern is that the clause opens the door for opting-out schools to change their characteristics to allow admission on the basis of academic criteria measured on IQ and by testing procedures, however imprecise such concepts may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second major concern is about special needs. There is anger, not only on these Benches but throughout Scotland, about the acceptance of last week's amendment for self-governing status to cover special needs schools. We do not believe that the Government are wholeheartedly committed to special needs and ensuring that, regardless of initial characteristics or changes to those characteristics, special needs are at the top of our social and education agenda. We were worried by the acceptance of the amendment last week, and by way of these amendments we are seeking a reassurance that the Government are taking seriously the concept of special needs. So far, we do not believe that that has been the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On special needs, I gave an undertaking to the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) that I would take on board the arguments that she has put to the committee on several occasions and that I would come back on Report. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has forgotten that. I gave a fairly strong undertaking that we would consider whether there should be a duty on self-governing schools to provide special needs education. I cannot think of anything that would be stronger than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a fair point, and we shall see how consistent his response is during this debate. The acceptance last week of the proposal that special needs schools be written into the Bill undermined in many ways the assurances that we had received on the sensitivity and complexity of the issue. However, I accept the Minister's point, and I remember the assurances that were given to the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). We hope that later in the debate, a positive response to our amendments will reinforce that initial assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
The Opposition's third concern about the status of self-governing schools is whether a child in what we would describe as a catchment area, despite the parents' charter, would be given priority access to the natural school of his choice. One of the difficulties if a school changed its characteristics would be that a child living within the delineated area, or catchment area, might not have automatic access to the school that because of tradition, his parents expected him to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth matter brings together the general concerns highlighted by the three other issues. Our main concern is that the characteristics initially built into the clause with reference to those specific factors should not be changed. We shall debate that under clause 28 but I mention it now to reinforce the seriousness with which we view clause 16 and the possibility of parents, albeit after a ballot, being able to change the characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does one define ability and aptitude as opposed to the general notion of what people in Scotland would regard as admission on academic criteria? Our previous debate was interesting, and, to take it further, I obtained a document prepared in July 1986 for the Scottish Education Department by Ruth Jonathan. "Giftedness and Education" is one of the few reports that has been commissioned by any organisation in the United Kingdom to look more closely at what giftedness and education mean in terms of policy and achievement. Until it was produced, what little literature had emerged had come from the United States. The report discusses how an education authority or Government could best examine the distinction between general ability and aptitude and more specific selection by academic criteria. It is a complex report, but parts of it are germane to the Committee's difficulties of definition. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The term 'gifted' is used to indicate any child who is outstanding in either a general or specific ability, in a relatively broad or narrow field of endeavour... Where generally recognised tests exist as (say) in the case of 'intelligence', then giftedness would be defined by test scores. Where no recognised tests exist it can be assumed that the subjective opinions of originality and imagination displayed would be the criteria we have in mind."</p></blockquote>
That highlights, perhaps more academically, one of our previous debates. We argue against the idea that giftedness may be interpreted by reference to recognised tests of intelligence so that test scores will determine whether a child goes to one school or another.

The report then quotes the Marland report of 1972 to the United States Congress, which defined giftedness as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Gifted and talented children are those identified by professionally qualified persons (and) who by virtue of outstanding abilities are capable of high performance. These are children who require differentiated educational programs and services beyond those normally provided by the regular school programme in order to realise their contribution to self and society.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Children capable of high performance include those with demonstrated achievement and/or potential ability in any of the following areas: (a) general intellectual ability, (b) specific academic aptitude, (c) creative or productive thinking, (d) leadership ability, (e) visual and performing arts, (f) psychomotor ability."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
That provides a useful analytical basis for the Scottish Office and the Minister to look more closely at how to define aptitude and ability to assuage the Opposition's fears that this is an attempt to bring in by the back door what we would call crude academic selection but what others might call selection on intelligence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He produced an interesting report on results between 1977 and 1987.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be useful for the Committee to read the 18-page statement that I have prepared on attainment in Glasgow schools. It covers the Drake report and the Williams report in the document of the Centre for Educational Sociology published in volume 3, 1987 of the 	<i>Oxford Review of Education.</i> I also have the most recent report of the Centre for Educational Sociology which puts Strathclyde schools, especially Glasgow schools, in a very good light. I do not know whether to detain the Committee by widening the debate, which you, Mr. Martin, might not accept. But I shall return to the interesting point about attainment in schools. It was slightly wide of the argument that I was trying to develop on how we can help the Government to be more specific about aptitude and ability and what might be more appropriately described as academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

Does he mean the work that examines the children's social background and works out how many exam passes they would have achieved if they had not come from working-class backgrounds? Is that what he means by putting Glasgow schools in a good light?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again you are being tolerant, Mr. Martin, so I shall respond briefly to that question. In response to my hon. Friend for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) in a previous sitting, the Minister gave us what was purported to be an academic analysis of attainment in Glasgow schools. He said that social class or the socio-economic status of a school should not influence the judgment of educational attainment in Glasgow or elsewhere. That is to deny that Glasgow Celtic appear in green and white hoops every week in a football match. No credible academic institution would deny that social class and the socio-economic status of a school, measured in terms of motivation and infrastructure, have a direct influence on educational attainment in Glasgow schools. More importantly, any analysis of Glasgow schools that does not recognise the social context is flawed and meaningless.

At that sitting, it was suggested that the Centre for Educational Sociology in Edinburgh had prepared that report. After further research, I have discovered that the information that the Minister used was not only five years out of date, but was prepared by a researcher who was working for the Centre for Educational Sociology but was commissioned to carry out that study for an HMI inspector in Glasgow. That evening, the Minister also failed to tell us that that document will not be found in the centre's bibliography; it was proved that the provisional findings of that study were so fundamentally flawed in methodology that it was consigned to the dustbin. That is the way in which the Government discuss serious educational issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). We are trying to provide the Government with more up-to-date, relevant, statistically important material than was used by Drake. If the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle reads about the issue in the copy of 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> that I have, he will find, like the Minister that that piece of research has been thoroughly discredited. The research took into account raw educational attainment data in Scottish schools without any regard of specific Glasgow schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is so confident that the research has been discredited, why did Strathclyde council refuse to publish it? Strathclyde is reported as saying that it is essential that proper information is published and is highly critical of the way in which it previously refused to do so. If the hon. Gentleman were so sure that the material would not stand up to scrutiny, why was Strathclyde council not willing to publish it, so that people could see the extent of the quality of the schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the question with a question. If the Minister is so anxious about Strathclyde publishing the material, will he produce the report that was sent to him by a Glasgow education officer? He referred to it in Edinburgh in a Scottish Grand Committee debate on education, and made the point about specific schools doing especially well. However, he did not qualify that information by referring to the social context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome the Government arranging a date and time when we can put on the record all the reports that have been prepared on this delicate and complex subject. We should like to debate the issue.

Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who compared Paisley grammar, which covers a range of social classes, with the schools in my constituency, which cover primarily relatively well-off owner-occupiers? The Labour party cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is nothing if not ingenious. I recall that debate in Committee, but I genuinely do not remember the details of the specific attack. The entire question of educational attainment is crucial to an understanding of why a Government would embark on a specific policy and enshrine it in legislation. If we are to pursue our policies on the constructive interpretation of giftedness, clearly we cannot do so on the basis of evidence that is suspect or may be flawed. The Minister is right to suggest that I am using material that should be subject to scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been proved conclusively that if we want an effective set of statistics that provides a basis on which analysis and prescription can be developed, we must have regard for not only the individual SCE attainment levels in each school, but the social context and the socio-economic status of each school. That would lead to a debate about investment, resources and whether the comprehensive system is fulfilling some of its earlier aspirations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious point. I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying about background, but we have only objective analysis to go on. Mr. Drake based his report on results. What could be more objective than that? He found a 43 per cent, decline in mathematics results and a 34 per cent, decline in science results. There are bound to be flaws in any report, but this report cannot have been so flawed that Glasgow parents do not consider its results deeply worrying. As in many big cities, parents in Glasgow have read the objective reports and are asking not necessarily for selection but for an improvement in standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is valid for the hon. Gentleman to select a piece of research to argue his point. The Drake report took raw—if that is the right word— SCE figures of attainment in Glasgow schools but did not expose that analysis to a wider contextual debate about the reasons for the results. It might be interesting to promote a particular political point of view, but it serves no useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can furnish the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle with as many reports as he wants about attainment in Glasgow schools since the publication in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> and the passing of the document to the Minister. Those reports show that it is not a black and white issue. Only a foolish person would argue that one set of statistics is overwhelmingly crucial while demoting other sets. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with arguing for raw data to be used as an exemplar of how to devise a policy when it is meaningless both in the academic community and the genuine policymaking community that exists in Strathclyde and the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inspectorate advised me that the methodology of the Drake report was not flawed. The hon. Gentleman might argue that the data in that report and others is not weighted to take account of social class, but in Glasgow schools the number of A to C passes that a child can expect at O-grade varies by a ratio of 9:1, depending on the school. When the hon. Gentleman spoke of the contextual arrangement did he mean that by examining the social class of pupils it is possible to weight the figures? If so, he is out of touch with reality. How does he account for the fact that a school like Our Lady and St Francis is facing closure? It has a difficult intake in terms of social class but is one of the most successful schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Chair is happy to have an extended debate on this issue, I can bring forward a volume of statistical material and analysis. In a previous debate the Minister would not acknowledge the influence of social class, which is a shorthand term for the social characteristics of pupils. We should also examine the socio-economic status of a school, which is a proxy for teacher and parental motivation, resources and a school's ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research material for the Drake report has been thoroughly discredited and I can provide evidence to prove it. If the Minister uses such material he does not deserve to be taken seriously. If hon. Members take raw SCE attainment figures and the social, or community, characteristics of pupils attending a certain school and examine other aspects of education in the school, they will come up with a composite picture which is a useful basis for debate. But we cannot remove two important components and say that what remains—the basic attainment figures—have any validity or value.

I understand that the Right-wing Members of the Conservative party now increasingly occupy their minds with that subject. Education and health are issues that have been left until later in their 10-year legislative programme. To be fair to the Minister, when he spoke to the Young Conservatives—a speech that was covered widely in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i>—he repeated the point that educational attainment figures should always be divorced from social class and its implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying that the school's ethos, teacher motivation and other matters are relevant factors, surely he accepts that by improving the ethos and teacher motivation and the organisation of the school better results will be achieved. If he accepts that, why does he commend to the Committee the McPherson approach, which would weight the pupils' performance according to their social class?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may say that examination results are unimportant, but ultimately it means that children attending Glasgow schools are disadvantaged in the number of examination passes that they can expect to achieve because of the ethos and because of the way that the school is organised. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a rather long intervention to accept in its entirety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we spend a few minutes on the Doug Williams study on attainment in Scottish schools, published in the 	<i>Oxford Review of Education</i> in 1987, which is an important document? That report embraces part of the Minister's contribution in that last intervention. We cannot remove one component from the influence of the other two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is correct about the socio-economic status of a school. He made the valid point that when considering educational attainment, academic attainment figures, which are important for parents and pupils, must be taken into account together with the characteristics of the pupils attending the school. The Minister is one third right in his assumption that that is an important area of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister and his hon. Friends to read the up-to-date research material on comprehensive education and on attainment in Glasgow schools. The argument is always about Glasgow schools, but there is a much wider debate about educational attainment in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that ethos is important? The study by Rutter et al in London schools in the early 1980s entitled "15,000 Hours" showed that ethos is important. But the social context is important, too. To borrow a phrase from the NHS review, even level playing fields are not level playing fields. If we include ethos, we must also include the social context. That is what my hon. Friend is driving at. When he accepts in part the Minister's remarks on ethos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being reasonably constructive on the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important debate on an important subject. It is so important that, earlier this afternoon, I received more information about the performance of Glasgow schools, but I shall not bore you further, Mr. Martin, by suggesting that Glasgow schools are doing better than most people think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touched on the study by Doug Williams. I shall make available to the Committee a report from the Centre for Educational Sociology for Strathclyde regional council, dated February 1989. That report deals with some genuine anxieties about achievement in Strathclyde, Scotland generally and Glasgow specifically. It is an authoritative paper, as it builds on the study frame of 40,000 leavers in 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984 and 1986 in Scottish schools. That comprehensive survey shows that in Glasgow, which has received a bad press, an examination of the complex relationship betwen socio-economic status, educational attainment and social class reveals a vastly improved picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report also identifies two compositional changes that have an impact on our debate. First, there has been a general increase in the proportion of people in the upper social classes, but that increase has not been the same in Glasgow as has been evident elsewhere in Strathclyde and the rest of Scotland. Secondly, the report's account of the impact of family
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>743</span>
structure on children achieving at school shows that while there has been a significant increase in the number of single-parent families in Glasgow, as there has been in Scotland overall, the proportional increase in Glasgow is more significant than it is in the rest of Strathclyde and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two compositional changes mean that Strathclyde, and Glasgow in particular, is improving dramatically, when issues of social class are taken into consideration. More importantly, the unadjusted figures for SCE attainment in Scottish schools also show a marked improvement in children from social classes 3 manual, 4 and 5, as well as from classes 1, 2 and 3 non-manual. A totally different picture is emerging from the one that is projected about Glasgow schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried. Quite properly, the hon. Gentleman is stressing the importance of single-parent families. As he will recognise, single-parent families are not a new phenomena. In the years immediately afer the second world war, there were many single-parent widows. Many of their children are a credit to them today. I do not want the hon. Gentleman's statement to suggest that single-parent families are not motivated. There are, of course, problems with some, but not all single-parent families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) makes a reasonable point. Any merging of the higher social classes and the family structure—the social composition and the family composition—can affect attainment. The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that it is difficult to avoid the simplistic conclusion that one group of single parents is doing well, but that another group is not. The issue is complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to my point about the distinction between aptitude and ability and our general anxieties about academic criteria as a basis for admission to Scottish schools. I was trying to go through what I regard as a helpful report. I am sure that Scottish Office officials are studying it. It is one of the few reports—I praise the Scottish Education Department for commissioning it—which tries to tackle the distinction between the two categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I suggested that it was possible to break down categories of giftedness into parts that are manageable and with which policy makers can grapple. The Opposition are worried that this is a back-door method of introducing a general basis for academic selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most impressed by my hon. Friend's knowledge of Scottish education. He is certainly teaching Conservative Members not to come into the Committee, read silly briefs and talk about things of which they know nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend have any figures on the numbers of gifted children, and which show whether they are distributed throughout Scotland or are concentrated in some areas? That will help us when we decide what to do about the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have assumed that I was doing reasonably well, but there are always awkward questions to be thrown towards me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) makes a fair point. The essence of the comprehensive system is not just noticing a child's potential, but realising it. Giftedness is not concentrated in any particular area, but is found throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. Although I cannot substantiate it with any research or analysis, I argue that giftedness is produced by the combination of social and genetic factors. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has touched upon the fact that it is a Scottish-wide matter. We believe, as the report suggests, that it is necessary to recognise children capable of high performance at an early stage, especially when they demonstrate achievement or potential ability in specific categories. That is the way out from the wooly phrase "ability and aptitude"; and the Bill would become more specific and the assurance that the Opposition require would be catered for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to rise again, but the Government have retreated bruised, beaten and ashamed of their performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be so lucky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept my hon. Friend's point about general distribution. My other question was how many children are we talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer my hon. Friend's question by using a methodology. If we accept the general thrust of the report, we must distinguish between the different categories of giftedness. An analysis based on that would show that the overall number of children involved is small. If the children are categorised into the areas of concern that I have highlighted, the figures will be further broken down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has made a point that needs to be developed. In earlier debates, the issue of children with a talent for dance and music were raised. Paragraph 2.4.4 on page 37 of the thought-provoking study considers non-cognitive giftedness. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All the definitions considered so far—overall intellectual ability, creative thought, talent in specific academic areas and cultural activities, have a cognitive emphasis. One of the ways in which advocates of identification and provision for the gifted have sought to overcome the stigma of elitism which attaches to this area, is to broaden the definition of gifts and talents to include some which are thought not wholly or not primarily cognitive. The major categories proposed concern sporting prowess, practical/technical skill, social/leadership qualities and 'ethical giftedness'. These will not be returned to in subsequent sections of the report since there is as yet little serious interest in these areas in Britain."</p></blockquote>
That text tackles the point that we raised about a further definition of aptitude and ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I wish to answer the question put by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I have not the foggiest idea about the meaning of ethical giftedness. The report is esoteric in parts, but much of it is practical. It talks of ethical giftedness leading into an area that is philosophically, metaphysically and sociologically difficult to interpret. The report states that there is a large area of definitions, and also says that no one has been able to give a definition that would, in theory, be beneficial to further debate, and useful in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have no idea how ethical giftedness can be tested, but perhaps a test could include the ability to admit that one has failed to say "no", as in Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can now provide the hon. Member for Eastwood with the report's definition of "ethical giftedness". It may provoke further euphoria from the Conservative Members. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, 'ethical giftedness' has emerged as a definitional category in its own right on the grounds that 'superior individuals' should comprise the good as well as the clever, as we value morality in private life and are faced publicly with increasingly complex moral dilemmas where ethical insight would be at a premium. Related research merits little discussion, since ethical gifts are not there judged by behaviour, but by tested capacity for moral judgement, usually categorised in terms of Kohlberg's stage theory of moral development".</p></blockquote>
I was aware that the hon. Member for Eastwood has that theory lurking in the back of his mind. Judging by his cry of recognition, it has obviously come to light. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since the chief standard 	<i>caveat</i> concerning this theory is that it over emphasises cognitive reasoning, it is hardly surprising that 'ethical giftedness' measured in this way turns out to correlate highly with cognitive ability, though it is presumed to be independent of it".</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and I have discussions outwith the Committee—I do not know whether that harms his career—and we shall pursue that matter. The issue provides a valuable philosophical context to a debate which, I assume, could have continued for many hours to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to make a serious point on academic ability—a crude concept which Scots perceive as not being part of our education, and which we would not like to see return. I have stated our obvious concerns about the dangers inherent in a return to academic selection based on aptitude and ability, which could be interpreted in many different ways. We cannot be more specific by changing the term or defining it further. Suffice it to say that we do not welcome any provision that gives schools an opportunity to identify characteristics and introduce academic selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for speaking at length on this issue, but I feel strongly about it. It concerns a contrast in political philosophy on the way forward for Scottish education. The issues of how we protect special needs provision, ensure that academic selection is not returned to Scottish schools and provide as a first priority for children within a catchment area lie at the heart of the debate on self-governing school status. We do not wish to see those characteristics enshrined in such a way as to be detrimental to Scottish school children. More importantly, we do not wish to see, in clause 28, a basis on which they can be further changed by a group of parents opting out at one particular time. Even with a ballot, parental choice under clause 28 will affect children in a much wider catchment area. It will affect children who may not attend the school for a long time. A balance must be struck to ensure that those crucial elements of policy are built in without risking the possibility, at a later stage, of wholesale changes that could affect pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, who has more knowledge of those matters than I, will be able better to contribute, so my final point is about how those elements could combine, in a rural environment, to put severe strains on parents and children. The Minister has already responded to that issue when it was raised by the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). He suggested that, if an opted-out ballot was provided with a scheme of management, he would find it difficult, at ministerial level, to approve something that would be to the disadvantage of a section of the wider community in a rural environment. I do not wish to detract from that assurance, because I think that the matter has been further considered. However, it concerns us that there are areas where one change of characteristic could take place.

If all those factors existed together in Scotland, that would pose a powerful threat not only to the quality of education but to the simple concept of equality of access. Therefore, I move the amendment in the hope that while some in the group with it may be technically deficient or ideologically objectionable, they show a clear concern about children, access, and the future quality of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the Minister asked us if we denied that the ethos of a school had anything to do with the results obtained by the pupils. Everyone of us readily assented to that proposition, but we are uncertain about how far the Minister and his colleagues accept that for two children of equal innate ability, factors such as enough sleep, sufficient and nutritious food, appropriate shoes and clothing to wear to school, the space and quiet to do homework, and freedom from worries and undue responsibilities for their age, are relevant to their attainment at school. If the Minister and his colleagues deny that, they fly in the face of all educational and sociological research that has been accepted as common sense, but has been borne out by statistical research and thoroughly studied in educational establishments throughout the world. Conservative Members seem to dismiss all those aspects as if they were of no account.

It is not simply a question of being working class, middle class or upper class. However, in households where not enough money comes in, the kind of problems that I have outlined are far more likely to arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and her hon. Friends have made considerable efforts to draw to the attention of the Committee the CES research, which is the basis for the claims that have been made about the comprehensive system and also deals with the performance of schools in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CES research on school effectiveness and the comprehensive system does not cover school effects such as the quality of teaching or school policies and practices. That is a major weakness. There is a view that social class and environment are the only relevant factors. The conclusions of the research done in London by Rutter and his colleagues to which the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) referred support our view that school effects are crucial. We see that in the variation of performance in particular schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has failed to answer my point. Of course the ethos of schools matters. Of course we should compare like with like so that a comprehensive is compared with another comprehensive, not a grammar school. However, the factors that I spelt out are as crucial to a child's attainment, as the factors to which the Minister has given weight? We are still waiting for an answer.

The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) spoke about the many single-parent families that existed after the second world war. That is a relevant point. The living circumstances of young widowed mothers are not the same as those of young girls who
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
are not long out of school and who decide to become unmarried mothers because they have no hope of a job and want to bring up a child and gain independence from their parental home. Common sense would tell us to acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must realise that many of these widows were teenagers and in their early twenties. Some of them had not just one child, but two or three. They were left in circumstances that I suggest were equally difficult when one thinks of the housing situation at that time and all the other factors. It is a credit to those mothers that so many of the youngsters grew up to be effective citizens. My point is that one cannot generalise about one-parent families: it is like saying that all poor people will be thieves. That is nonsense. It all depends on the circumstances and on the motivation and personality of the individual involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody has said that it is reprehensible to be a one-parent family. We are simply saying that the differences between how the circumstances come about must be recognised. Of course it is a credit to any single mother if she manages to bring up her trail of children in adverse circumstances, but it is quite widespread nowadays when formerly it was not because of different social attitudes. It is quite a widely known phenomenon now for young girls to decide to have a child and to get away from the family home into a home of their own. I am simply saying that their circumstances are not the same as those of young widows.

Under clause 16 (4)(c) the board must specify any admission arrangements relating to ability and aptitude. The Government still have not told us how confident they feel about testing for ability and aptitude. It is possible to take a snapshot of how a class of youngsters relate to each other in terms of ability, and that can be tested by objective criteria in examinations, but we all know that children develop at different rates. The child who is behind his or her classmates in one year could go far ahead of them in the future. Is that something else that we have to tell the Government or can it be taken as a well-known piece of common sense?

I refer Tory Members to the life story of Winston Churchill—about whom they presumably know a lot—who led this country to victory in the second world war, as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) reminded us. I read Churchill's biography and it would bring tears to a glass eye. He came from a wealthy family but he was neglected by his parents who sent him away to boarding school when he was only six years old. His mother did not even visit him on holidays if she had a more important social engagement, so it is not surprising that he turned out as he did. He failed his school examinations. He wrote, and this has always stuck in my mind, that he would willingly have told the examiners all that he knew but they insisted on knowing what he did not know. He was a failure at school and no one would have predicted that he would rise to such greatness. How would the future
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
of a Winston Churchill have been decided when he was 11 years old, crying because his mother had yet again not turned up at the school gates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet been told how aptitude would be tested. How can aptitude be tested when the pupil has no experience in the subject? It is a serious problem for the education of both boys and girls. Girls are often deemed to have no aptitude for technical subjects when they have not had the same experience of playing with tools, Lego, building blocks and so on. Typically, Meccano and other such things are given to boys. Likewise, boys are deemed to have no aptitude for domestic skills. Therefore, half the population is brought up unable to sew on a button or boil an egg. That is absurd in an educational system and it is a result of the failure to give children a breadth of experience so as to decide what aptitudes they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How could we test for ability so that we would know with utter confidence how a child would develop in future years? How could we test for aptitude when children may not have had the relevant experiences? If the Government can tell us that, we shall be interested to hear it. However, I notice the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), who has been described in Andrew Roth's entertaining book as someone who promotes the idea of favouring the gifted and the able. Will he tell us how he picks out the gifted and the able, when that is so difficult to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that in every leaving year in Scottish universities, the honest graduates, year upon year, have people in the class who were told at school that they had better find a job in the local supermarket because they were never going to have an academic career. Yet later, they develop those abilities and can do extremely well. The point of comprehensive education is to recognise those plain, commonsense facts and give children whose abilities were not recognised at the age of 11 the opportunity to go on and make the most of reasonable chances along with their fellow pupils instead of being told, "That's it. Here are the sheep and you lot are among the goats and that's your opportunities ended for good." There has been far too much of that sort of attitude in Scottish education. All Opposition Members, at least, have had parents who have suffered from that because they were cast aside in the educational process and did not get the chances that they should have had and which a future generation, more or less from ours onwards, did have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not going to stand idly by and let that happen to Scottish education once again. It goes very much against the ethos of Scottish education as a whole. We care about giving all children a proper chance, all their school life, and not dividing them into sheep and goats at some arbitrary age and telling them, "That's it, your chances are over".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendments deal with the definition and preservation of the essential characteristics of a school at the time of opting out. The essential point here, which has been demonstrated this afternoon and will be demonstrated again in subsequent debates, is that the Opposition do not trust parents to make decisions on the future of their local school and of children in their community. It seems most likely to me that schools opting out are doing so to preserve rather than change their existing characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious point. The hon. Gentleman is accusing Opposition Members of not trusting parents to make the decision for themselves, but the Bill does not trust them because the decision rests with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The parents' view is only indicative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, but the Secretary of State can only consider a decision after a ballot in which the parents have made their views known. We cannot be criticised for giving parents too much power and then for not giving them any because the Secretary of State makes the final decision. That is a proper process. Parents are involved at the beginning and hold a ballot to make their views known. The matter then goes to the Secretary of State. I have no doubt that a Conservative Secretary of State will make the right decision in every case, based on what the parents have told him in their ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to return to my hon. Friend's argument. If parents are to be trusted, why go to the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we are a Government who wish to take account of every possible factor. We accept that there may be the odd case in which parents vote for one course of action but in the wider context for which the Secretary of State is responsible, he may have to come to a different decision. As I have said before, I do not know whether many schools will want to opt out. We are simply giving them the opportunity to do so should they decide to take it. They may want to opt out but the Secretary of State may have to take other factors into account. On that basis the Opposition have nothing to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an empirical example for the hon. Gentleman. I was involved in setting up a community project from the beginning. I was counselled by officials from Strathclyde regional council. As might have been the case whichever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
council was involved, some of those officials wished to retain the power. In that project, we had written into the standing orders that if two thirds of the community were present and voted to dissoved the project they had the right to do so. The money would be handed back through urban aid to the Scottish Office. Some officials were alarmed when that measure was passed. Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that that was democratic and expressed the will of the people? If he would accept that as part of the standing orders for a community project—I can give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse if he wishes— why does he not accept it for schools, in which parents have a legitimate interest in the continuing education of their children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That example is not especially relevant, but I shall respond to it. My view is clear. In such a ballot the most democratic arrangement is that the result of the ballot represents the decision. There should be no hurdles, no ifs and buts, no different geographical locations. One simply asks the parents and a 50 per cent, decision wins the day, just as when we elect Governments of this country—there is no higher authority than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how he would test for ability and aptitudes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am allowed to develop my argument I shall do so. When I was a teacher a few years ago I did exactly that. I am happy to say that results at the age of 11 bore a remarkable similarity to pupils' performances at the ages of 14 and 16—and that was at a mixed comprehensive school. I shall be happy to develop that theme if I am allowed to get further forward with my argument.

Can Opposition Members tell the Committee why a school, especially one in a rural area, should want to exclude children from its own community? They appear to fear that a school would opt out and after a few years take a policy decision specifically excluding children of its local community. Why should any school make that decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall cite the example used by a Tory Member. There could be a large influx of new members who did not share the community's ethos and values and were not linked with it. For example, an oil community could soon change the characteristics of the school and exclude local children. That fear is held by many rural and small communities, and it provides a classic example of what we are worried about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman had the courage to reply, but surely he is missing the point. An influx of new parents voting to change the admissions policy of a school does not affect pupils already at the school. It will not affect present parents' children about to enter the school. It will do so only
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
after a decent interval. It would not affect the nature of the school during the time in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means that parents can change the nature and characteristics of the school. They can make it selective and prevent local children from gaining access in the future. That fear about small rural schools is expressed not only by Opposition Members but by Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that fear exists but it is groundless. Whether parents are newcomers or have lived in the area for many years, why would they want to exclude certain people of their local community from attending school, especially if it would then have surplus capacity? What is the logic of that? It would be unfair and unreasonable and the matter would have to go to the Secretary of State and doubtless he would make the right decision.

Parents are interested in admissions policy because schools of academic excellence are always popular. Parents are also interested in discipline, school uniform and in the needs of all pupils. We should not be diverted by the sometimes emotional argument of special needs. What about the special needs of the gifted and talented? Special education applies to 20 per cent, of pupils. We sometimes assume that special education refers only to the 2 per cent, of children with physical or mental handicaps. It is about time we looked at the other 18 per cent, because the needs of the specially talented and gifted have been overlooked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that figure. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that 18 per cent, of pupils are gifted children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that. Twenty per cent, of children are identified as having special needs and it is estimated that 2 per cent, have special needs because of physical or mental disability. That leaves 18 per cent, whose special needs are not covered by special needs education. They include the specially talented and gifted with a range of special needs, for example in music, drama or sport, which cannot be met within the narrow confines of the normal school curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us whether, he is confident that he never failed to recognise a child's ability in a subject that may not have developed in that child at the time the examinations were set and marked? Would he not accept that it is possible to develop those talents later? According to his arguments, that child would have missed the boat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that mistakes are made—no system is perfect. When parents make a decision, they must take all those factors into account. I taught in a mixed comprehensive school with an intake at the age of 11. We banded the children into two upper, one middle and three lower bands. We used their standardised scores from their primary schools as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
basis, but the banding was such that no form had the good teachers or the bad teachers and the curriculum was the same. However, the pace of teaching and learning was geared to the potential ability of those pupils and there was movement within those bands within the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipated my intervention. I wanted to ask about the level of flexibility between the various bands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. At the end of each year, the children were tested and moved to a different band if necessary and without causing disruption. I was responsible for regular monitoring. I was as concerned as anybody to ensure that we had not made mistakes because that was in one's interest. Their test scores and estimated potential at the age of 11 was borne out by their achievements at the age of 14 and at subsequent public examinations. The achievements of children at the age of 11 cannot be predicted with great accuracy, but can show what is possible for those pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following with great interest what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He seems to be putting emphasis on standard testing. Was emphasis put on continuous assessment by the classroom teacher? That is also important when assessing the aptitude and ability of a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. Standardised testing shows one aspect, but continuous assessments give a continuous profile of a pupil's progress. A proper school would consider the results not only of standardised tests, but the continuous assessment by a classroom teacher, so that special factors such as late developers are taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How did the hon. Gentleman cope with the problem of children who did not fall neatly into one of those bands, and who, for example, were exceptional at maths, average at other subjects, but hopeless at history and geography?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly my point. The procedure was based on subjects. For example, a child could be in the lower band, but in the top set for maths, or in the upper band, but in the bottom set for maths. Both aspects were covered, so a child did not feel that, because he was in the bottom band, he was no good academically. I knew pupils with ability that I could never acquire, such as technical, scientific and mathematical skills, who were in a lower band.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That being the case, will the hon. Gentleman admit that he should be supporting our argument on the subject? We are arguing against splitting up children so that they have no hope even of entering the school on the grounds of ability and aptitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because when we talk about selection, we mean that the range of ability of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
school is limited to, for example, the top 20 per cent., the next 40 per cent, or to 100 per cent. Whatever the intake of a school, it has the responsibility to structure its forms and set its streaming to the needs of its pupils. Therefore, it does not matter whether the intake of a school has the top 20 per cent, academic ability or 100 per cent. It is crucial to education how a school uses its intake, identifies the needs of pupils and makes provision for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the right of parents to opt for schools whose admissions policy is based on academic selection. When I was a chairman of an education committee, I undertook policies to that effect. However, I also accept the right of parents to choose schools which are based on other established criteria. It is not for me to impose a system on parents. I want them to choose their own system of education. I accept the right of parents to choose an education system that is steeped in diversity. Conservative Members do not fear diversity. It is a question of leaving it to others to make decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members do not accept the right of parents to have as wide a choice as possible, they should face up honestly to the consequences of their narrow-minded, pathological inability to trust no one, except remote bureaucracies with preconceived dogmas of social engineering. They must face the human problems involved in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he squares his rhetoric about choice with the fact that he endorses the notion of academic selection in certain schools? Such academic selection will exclude certain pupils from certain schools. That is the opposite of choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. I am happy for parents to decide whether their schools should opt out. Whatever their decision, I will accept it. I do not think that many schools will opt out. Few parents will wish to change a school's characteristics so that it becomes a selective school. No parents would do so if it were not in the interests of the local community and their children. I trust parents not to create a school merely to exclude certain children. The democratic ballot and the involvement of the Secretary of State mean that that could not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members must accept the widest possible choice. They must understand the trauma, fear, anger and desperation of parents whose children cannot attend their first choice school, even if it has spare capacity, just to fill unpopular second-rate schools. I have seen that happen and it has been a formative influence on my thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in charge of an education authority that had a system similar to that operating in Scotland in terms of parental choice. It was unacceptable and I could not justify a system under which parents were told that their child could not attend the school of their choice even if it had places because someone had to attend the unpopular school to keep it viable. Such forced or restricted entry is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge Opposition Members to justify a system of reduced choice. The logic of their argument leads to that conclusion. If there is an eighth form entry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
school unpopular schools must still be kept open, so children will be shuffled around and choice will not be maximised. The Opposition aim to keep as many comprehensive schools open as possible in as wide an area as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the amendments would lead to the situation that the hon. Gentleman describes. They attempt to prevent a school with vacancies from refusing entry to certain pupils who are considered not to match its ethos or academic standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is theoretical. I am not convinced that the mass of parents want schools to opt out so that they can exclude children from their local community for extraordinary reasons. However, if parents considered all the factors and reached that decision, I would trust them. They know the community's needs. Politicians do not always know best so we should let the parents decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that the parents must decide. Earlier he said that in certain circumstances he would not trust them and that the Secretary of State must decide. If he considers that such a decision is impossible or incredible, what possible objection could he have to including a provision in the Bill to ensure that it is impossible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have supported and run schools whose admissions criteria were based on academic selection. However, I would not force that system on parents who did not want it. If a community wanted it, it should have the right to choose it but I do not believe that many parents would do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What level of support in the community would convince the hon. Gentleman that the majority of people wanted that change? If 55 per cent, of the parents eligible to vote voted in favour, would he accept that they had the right to impose such a change on the other 45 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has already been dealt with in the Bill. I accept that there is to be a democratic vote and if the turnout is not sufficient, there will be another vote. The matter will then go to the Secretary of State for a final decision. We cannot fiddle around with the voting procedure to get the result that we want—that is a good Liberal party tactic. We must accept that the majority decision wins the day. I am not in favour of fiddling the voting procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the bottom of the argument is the Opposition's blind faith in the comprehensive idea and the ethos of comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Definitely ethos. The logic of the argument used by Opposition Members is that they believe in the merits of ghetto schools. I say that deliberately, but it is not meant pejoratively. If I could think of a better word than ghetto, I would use it. Certain types of comprehensive schools will exist
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
in middle-class suburbs for middle-class pupils and other types of comprehensive schools will exist in inner-city areas for working-class pupils. That is wrong. I want mobility; I want the social classes to mix. A comprehensive system with an intake based on geographical proximity means that those are exactly the schools that we shall get and are exactly the schools that we have got.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see how a school in a poor area that opts out will improve its position in relation to a school that opts out in Bearsden or Milngavie. Can the hon. Gentleman take me through the argument of how opting out will change the character of a school and improve the social mix? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that someone from Bearsden or Milngavie will move to Possil Park?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I answer the hon. Gentleman, I shall be ruled out of order, unless I explain quickly before that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is simple. Many people assume that working-class families, for example, are not as interested as middle-class families in education. [Hon Members: "No".] Good. We agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience shows that, regardless of social class, all parents are in favour of discipline and the wearing of uniform. Schools have that to a greater, or lesser, extent. If a school opted out and the ethos of that school—in terms of discipline, streaming, banding, or whatever—changed, that school would become very popular. It would then not matter to a middle-class person that the school was in a working-class area because parents would want to send their children there. The reverse would also apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts are there. When Shirley Williams and her colleagues destroyed grammar schools in an act of pure vandalism, they destroyed schools where the social mix existed regardless of whether children were from working-class or middle-class families. Grammar schools existed on the objective criteria of ability, potential and aptitude. They contained pupils of all social backgrounds and they were destroyed. Some are now independent, but the majority are comprehensive. Those in middle-class areas inadvertently excluded working class children. The criterion of geographical proximity was chosen, and they knew that, subtley and cleverly, it would exclude working class children. That is exactly what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
happened. Working class children who would have gone to grammar schools now go to their local comprehensive schools, which are probably in the inner city, second rate, second best and not good enough for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party wants to preserve what exists now. Unashamedly and proudly, we want to give parents the power to break that system. It is pointless for Opposition Members to ask us to accept an amendment that prohibits the mere possibility of an admissions policy based on academic selection when the whole thrust of opting out is to make available as wide a range of education provision as parents want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to amendment No. 132. The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) might find that it covers aspects of what he has spoken about already. If he believes what he said, logically he should vote with us on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 is small, but effective. Perhaps I am anticipating what the Minister may bring back on Report, but the amendment's purpose is to ensure that every school will provide for children with special educational needs. By removing the words, "if any" from subsection (4)(b), the amendment would ensure automatic provision for children with special educational needs in schools. When we talk of special educational needs, I would include specially gifted children, but I have concentrated on other aspects of educational needs during our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Warnock report suggested that 20 per cent, of children need special provision at some stage in their school careers, and often at the further education stage as well. I shall return to that in our discussions on later clauses because special educational needs do not necessarily end at the age of 16 when the child may leave school. The Warnock report is generally accepted as the gospel on special educational needs and no hon. Member would try to deny its effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said already that 2 per cent, of those children attend special schools and I regret the decision that the Committee took to allow special schools to opt out. Many organisations representing those children will be equally angry when they meet the reality of that decision. The 2 per cent, refers to children who have records of needs and attend special schools. That leaves 18 per cent, of children who require special assistance at some stage, but that does not automatically mean that 18 per cent, of children in every school will have special educational needs. The figure in some schools will be well over 20 per cent, and in others it will be only a small percentage. Even if only the child needs special educational assistance, that should be available. I want it to be written into the Bill that such provision will be available in every school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier today, the Minister had great fun referring to reports in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> His own quotes dealt with quality and responsiveness in education. Amendment No. 132 demands clearly
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
quality and responsiveness from the Government. More importantly, perhaps, it demands also an unqualified recognition of a sector that cannot and must not be ignored. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham talked in a vacuum because many of the points that he made about grammar schools do not affect Scotland. Most children in Scotland attended the local high school. Although, within the high school, there may have been streaming based on academic ability, it tended to be flexible. Scottish people are used to neighbourhood comprehensive schools. Children, irrespective of their academic ability, tend to go there. We should regret selection based on academic ability being imposed upon Scotland. It is our alien to our traditions and it is not good for the social mix to cut children with academic abilities off from other children by putting them into separate schools. Children should mix so that the talents of the more gifted are of assistance to children who are not so able. The good characteristics of some children rub off on all the others. If we separate the children, we shall lose that valuable aspect of the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the highly ideological tone of the speech made by the hon. Member for Hexham. It did not deal with the issues that Opposition have tried to tackle in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I do not believe that Conservative Members understand the sensitivities involved in special needs. One of the strengths of the comprehensive system is the enormous inroads—that it has made in a previously neglected sector. My hon. Friend's amendment is simple but effective. It goes to the core of the cavalier attitude that the Government have adopted towards special needs and protection for children. We should build on the significant strengths of the comprehensive sector, which are evident all over Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has spelt that out clearly. Amendment No. 132 is simple but significant and it deals the important aspect of the assistance that should be given when a child needs learning support. The term "remedial education" is now passé and we now use the words "learning support."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put into the Bill the automatic requirement on school boards of management to spell out in their published proposals to the parents that such support will be provided. I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment because it should not cause him offence. If it anticipates the amendments that he said that he would introduce on Report and he gives me a clear idea of what they are, I shall consider withdrawing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak, but the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) stirred me up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) is practical and sensible. As she suggested, the Minister previously assured the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
Committee that he would take it into account so I shall not labour my remarks. However, the removal of the words "if any" would remove the option of not making the provision. That is what the amendment is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a comprehension gap between the two sides of the Committee. We either see things differently or we do not understand them in the same way. The hon. Member for Hexham argued forcefully and coherently that opting out would improve the social class mix in a school. I fail to understand that argument altogether. In Scotland there are large rural areas and some urban concentrations. Opting-out will not make a docken's worth of difference to the social class mix in schools in my constituency or in the constituencies of the hon. Members for Moray or for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be aware that a substantial number of people in my constituency have made use of the legislation that gave parents the choice to select secondary schools for their children. That meant children travelling long distances. My children, for example, travel from Blairgowrie to Perth out of choice. Many of my constituents have children who travel from Pitlochry and Aberfeldy to Perth. Others travel from other parts of my constituency to Blairgowrie. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that cannot continue to happen? If so, that is surprising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow what the hon. Gentleman says. Certainly that will continue to happen. The secondary school in Drumnadrochit, which used to be in my constituency but is no longer, is small. Some argue for the value of the samll secondary school in communal terms and the special treatment that teachers can give to small classes, but others argue that small school cannot provide as many subjects as a larger one. Therefore, despite the fact that the community fought vigorously to prevent the Government from closing the school in Drumnadrochit, some parents chose to send their children to schools in Inverness because they offered a wider choice of subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know why the Minister is shaking his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Government were closing the school, but that is not so, because the Government have no responsibility for school closures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come, come. We all know that this is irrelevant to the amendment—if I may anticipate your ruling, Mr. Martin—but we all know that schools were closed, because there was no money to keep them open. It is as simple as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is as simple as that, because education budgets were cut by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would do well to look at the figures. Rather than being cut, education
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
budgets have been increased. The numbers of pupils declined and education authorities had to rationalise their capacity. Therefore, it is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that the Government are responsible. Education authorities had to bring their provision into line with the fall in the number of pupils. As far as I am aware, no one has blamed the Government for the reduction in the supply of pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must live in an isolated cocoon if he can say that as far as he is aware no one has blamed the Government. Within the Highland region, many schools were closed that the Highland region did not want to close. It is fair to say that some schools were closed because of the roll decline, but there were others where that argument was not the fundamental. The fundamental was that the education authority would have liked to keep the school open despite the declined roll, but did not have the money to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be taken away from my answer to the hon. Member for Hexham. I repeat that I do not see how opting out will improve the social class mix in rural areas or in the cities, for example, between Bearsden and Castlemilk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate that one of the advantages of schools in rural areas is that they take children from the local community and therefore represent a good social mix. I welcome that, and feel that few such schools would want to opt out, so the social mix would remain as it is. I accept that the comments that I made about improving the social mix would apply essentially to schools in urban areas, although not in every case. Therefore, opting out will be more attractive to schools in urban areas, where it will improve the social mix. If they do not do so, no change will have been made in the schools. The idea of opting out is to give schools the opportunity to change their ethos and characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am simple, but I would guess that if a school in an urban area decides to opt out, it will not be with the objective of improving the social mix. I should have thought that the contrary would be the compelling imperative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not simply be a case of children from Bearsden going to Castlemilk, but pupils from Castlemilk would come in their droves to Bearsden. I do not see how, if a school in either area opts out, that process suddenly takes place automatically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the droves were coming from Castlemilk to Bearsden, I suspect that arrangements would be specified whereby pupils were admitted by reference to ability and aptitude, to prevent that from happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of the amendment is not opting-out as such, but selective admission. How on earth selective admission can be thought to lead to improved social mix baffles everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts the point that I was trying to make with great lucidity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
The other argument to which the hon. Member for Hexham kept returning was that parents know best. That fine, ringing phrase would receive loud applause at any gathering of parents, but it is being advanced in a fundamentally casuistic way. Many parents, including myself to some extent, do not regard themselves as education experts. Their capacity to judge such matters is limited and they would need to ask advice. The object of the Bill is to give parents choice, but it will not give choice to all parents, just the majority of a certain group who have an interest in the matter. There are all sorts of inbuilt dangers when a small, motivated group of parents run the show as they think best. That worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham portrayed the Secretary of State—perhaps because he is sitting in front of him—as a perpetually benign figure who always takes perfect decisions. Although the right hon. and learned Gentleman is a man of great modesty in this Committee, and of pleasing taciturnity, even he would not say that the Scottish Education Department would always make the right decision. The advantage is that there are various sieving mechanisms, such as education authorities and appeals to the Secretary of State, which involve the Scottish Education Department and inspectors. Given that those safeguards remain to a considerable extent, I think that the rather populist approach, that those who oppose the Bill are opposing parental involvement or the natural familial interest of the parent in the well-being of his or her child, is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Simply to establish self-governing schools that will be governed by a small selection of parents will not necessarily improve the present traditional system of education that we have become used to in Scotland. I am not saying that the system does not need improvement, but generally it has been quite successful, both educationally and socially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham should re-examine his position, because his arguments were not well founded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) made several points, some of which were confusing. To say that his logic was circuitous would be a nice way of putting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seemed to advocate comprehensive education above a certain level. But under the Bill, at the interface between primary 7 and SI, there will be a divide between pupils who are allowed in and those who are kept out as a result. Therefore, the divide is irrevocable at that stage and no amount of interpretation of the provisions can disguise that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow his own logic, the hon. Member for Hexham should have had some sympathy with amendment No. 146, which would replace the provision that currently reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"specifying any arrangements whereby pupils are admitted to the school by reference to ability or optitude".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Hexham mentioned ghetto schools, which was quite a cheek, as we know about areas that are run down. The press release that was the object of much mirth among Conservative Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
said that the Institute of Local Government Studies at Birmingham university praised Strathclyde for running a social strategy in response to high unemployment and poverty. So there are many different environments in which schools operate, and Strathclyde has done well in adopting that social strategy. It is facile to say, as the hon. Gentleman has done, that we should trust the parents and let them decide. If we follow his logic again, we trust the parents to decide until the final decision, and then they are not consulted. The final decision is taken by one person—the Secretary of State for Scotland, who may override any community voice or interests when he decides whether a school can opt out. The community's wish is subordinate to the wish of one individual. That is not democracy. That is not trusting the parents. It is centralising education with a vengeance. In addition, the Secretary of State will hold the ace card regarding finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the hon. Member for Hexham rely on? He says that people will have fears, but that what they fear will not happen. What a sublime statement. The hon. Gentleman's precondition for the Bill is a gigantic act of faith. The Opposition do not rely on a gigantic act of faith because we know what the reality is just as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council does. It said that it was inconceivable that a board of management would be able to refuse a place to a child who would automatically have been admitted to the school when it was under education authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is perfectly reasonable and acceptable and I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman could not agree with the SPTC's proposition. Furthermore, it stated that amendment No. 146 would prohibit any procedure whereby pupils may be admitted to schools on the basis of academic or other ability or aptitude, and that such a procedure would be a fundamental change to access to state-maintained schools and should be done only after separate consultation and legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SPTC feels the same as we do because it has faith in comprehensive education; it knows the track record. Let us think back to the time before comprehensive education was introduced in Scotland and elsewhere. In that golden age four out of every five children failed the 11-plus and were put into secondary and junior secondary schools. That did not mean that children did not mix in their own social community, but it meant that the children with whom I played football and with whom I played out in the street would say, "I'll see you after school because the eejits go to one school and you go to the other school." That is the type of system that the hon. Gentleman wants to see return and that is the language that is used to describe it. If he came up to Scotland, he could see the strides that we have made in comprehensive education and he would not support the Government on these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comprehensive education has been almost universally accepted in Scotland. Statistics have proved over the years that all social classes have done well under comprehensive education, not least
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
working-class children. Girls have also done well because the stereotyping of girls has been gradually reduced, although not totally eliminated, and girls are doing much better academically than boys. A return to a selective system would end that because it would reinforce stereotyping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill the system would be left to chance. It would be chequebook education, as the Minister stated in the Scottish Grand Committee. It would depend on how much money one's parents had. We do not want to leave it to chance. We want everyone to have equality of opportunity to go to school. Hon. Members have mentioned Rutter. He carried out a study of comprehensive education in London schools, looking at 12 schools in particular. The Minister is right. The ethos of the school is important. The attitude of the head teacher and teachers is important as is whether they turn up on time for their classes and the example that they set. That management philosophy and approach can be encouraged within the comprehensive education system. Rutter had praise for the comprehensive education system, although he said that it could be improved. He recognised ethos, but said that there was a social reality that had to be catered for. He advocated better management. He said that each and every child should feel important and should be the centrepiece of education provision within the school. That had been advanced in comprehensive education, which is why it has been accepted almost universally in Scotland. It has done Scotland proud over the past 15 years. But we face reality. We know that there are different environments and that there is a difference between Bearsden and Pollok.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own experience of teaching in the Pollok area was at a special educational unit set up for kids, mostly those who appeared before children's panels who would formerly have been sent to list D schools. The approach of the children's panels was not to send those children into residential care but to keep them in the community because they discovered that if they were put into residential care in list D schools— my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will probably reinforce this—they had the best education in the university of life, and they came back more sophisticated and more alien to their environment. So the children's panels kept more children in the community. But that meant more problems for the community and for the school. In other words, the school had to take much more of a management approach to those children and their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from experience of spending hours upon hours with children, that attendance was a real problem. I remember one case conference on a child who was extremely troublesome about coming to school. Through the good work of the local social sendees department, we managed to get the child to come to school for the case conference and there we were, eight or nine adults sitting round with the child, focusing on his needs, deficiencies or whatever, suggesting to him that he should come to school and asking why he did not come. He kept his mouth shut for long enough. However, after three quarters of an hour he admitted that the did not come to school as much as he could. I said, "Tell me why." So the
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
breakthrough came, and the reason why he did not come to school as often as he could was that there was a supermarket adjacent to the school, which had adopted a policy that whoever took trolleys back to the supermarket would get l0p for every one that he took back. So it came out that the fellow could not resist passing the trolley park because he was making £10 or £15 a day. Needless to say—as hon. Members know, I am connected with the Co-op party and sponsored by it—it was a Co-op shop. So that policy was terminated a couple of weeks thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that there are extraneous interests and environmental problems that must be taken into consideration even to get some children to school in some areas. As the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) said, the Goverment's proposals do not recognise that one whit and there is no way that there will be more social cohesion. There will be social division rather than social cohesion if the Bill goes through, so the good work that has gone on for years will be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) suggested, factors that are not strictly part of the amendment should be taken into consideration. The issue of free school meals and the Social Security Act 1986 has a great part to play. Many children come to school and can have a square meal at lunchtime, knowing that when they go home they will not get a square meal. That is an attraction for them to come to school and it helps to make the education environment more stable for them. Those issues must be taken into consideration and I am afraid that Conservative Members have simply concentrated on examination result league tables and have not considered any other aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) eloquently discussed education attainment. The Minister taunts us with the report on Glasgow. Perhaps I may taunt him with the reason why he does not publish the under-fives report on primary and nursery education, which we have been trying to obtain since the beginning of 1980. When my hon. Friend goes to Glasgow tomorrow, I trust that he will have a word with the director of education and others in Strathclyde about the Glasgow report and find out what the problems are in Glasgow, so that we can reeducate Conservative Members a little about the social realities in Scotland at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two arguments on the group of amendments. Despite his frustration at not being allowed to speak, I hope that the Minister will contain himself a wee bit longer and listen to some of the relevant arguments. I do not want to risk going down the road of ethical giftedness to Plato and Aristotle again, but there is a moral argument on the amendments. There is also an argument about the educational efficiency of comprehensive schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the moral argument in favour of comprehensive education. As my hon. Friends have said, it is a simple argument. The value and merit of a social mix in schools is that it enables people of different classes and backgrounds to mix and learn together. The hon. Member for Hexham
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
(Mr. Amos) has a limited view of what that social mix entails. He praises the grammar schools for having achieved a sort of social mix, but he thinks that that has been achieved if middle-class children mix with those who are about to become middle-class. The Opposition disagree. We believe that the social mix should be a mix of children who will end up in very different places in life after they leave school. Some will enter the middle class and others, other classes of society, yet while they are at school together they will learn, work and play together both in the playground and, we hope, out of school. The value of achieving such a mix is profound. Conservative Members should be aware that for many years people in Scotland have laid great stress on that as a virtue of the Scottish education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently looked through an influential commentary on Scottish education, written in 1834— George Leslie's "Scotland, a Half-Educated Nation". The author complained about the impact of industrialisation on the parish school system as it had operated in Scotland, and about the fact that that system could no longer cope. There was increasing development in the voluntary sector—what might today be called the private sector—which George
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
Leslie considered a disaster for Scottish education On page 43 of his book he said that the effect of that development and of the decline of the parish schools was that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"dissociates the different classes of society in early life; and by separating at school those who are but too apt to be altogether separated in manhood, breaks society into discordant parts: so that we look in vain, in the large towns of Scotland, for those kindly feelings between all classes, which arose in the parish schools of Scotland … strengthening the bands, of society."</p></blockquote>
Our experience in the Committee may lead us to think that George Leslie was rather optimistic in talking about potential kindly feelings between classes, but he argued that it was not enough to have a grammar school type of social mix—that is, a mix of children from middle-class backgrounds and those who have taken the first step towards being upwardly mobile and who will finish in middle-class occupations. The great value of the democratic parish tradition of Scottish education was that it involved children from all the different classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
