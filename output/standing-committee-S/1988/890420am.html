	<time>Thursday 20 April 1989</time>

	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I refer you and the Committee to the 	<i>Official Report</i> for Tuesday 18 April. The passage in question relates to the Division on amendment No. 136. The Opposition said "Aye" to the amendment. There was no apparent response from the Government, but the Chairman decided to put the Question again and consequently the Government won. I shall quote from the 	<i>Official Report.</i> The Chairman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Question is, That the amendment be made. As many as are of that opinion say, 'Aye'."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members said, "Aye". The Chairman then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To the contrary, 'No'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Ayes have it."</p></blockquote>
After an interruption, the Chairman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I now come to amendment No. 191".—	<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 18 April 1989; c.697.]</p></blockquote>
There was no response from the Government Benches until the Minister raised a point of order. Do you have any comment on that incident, Mr. Hogg?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Before you comment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall decide whether I shall comment on a point of order. However, I shall hear what the hon. Member has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not dream of being critical of your comments, Mr. Hogg. I do not have a copy of 	<i>Hansard</i> to hand, but my recollection is that the Chairman told the Committee that the Question was put again because he had not proceeded in the correct order. He acknowledged that I had said "No", but said that he had not heard me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for those points of order. I think that I can help the Committee by explaining the procedure on Divisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a Question is put and the Chairman calls on hon. Members to say "Aye" and "No", he does not declare the result. He declares his opinion of the result, and if that is challenged, the Committee proceeds to a Division. As I understand it—I stress that because the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) was in the Chair at the time—the Chairman put the Question again on
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
Tuesday because he was not sure that he had given hon. Members an adequate opportunity to challenge his declaration that the "Ayes" had it before moving on to the next amendment. He felt that the Committee could not go on to the next business if there were any doubt at all in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether any hon. Member said "No" was irrelevant to his decision, as all that matters is what the Chairman hears. He clearly did not hear any hon. Member say "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the only ruling that I can give on the matter. I stress that I was not present, and hope that hon. Members will not press me further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I wish to bring a serious matter to the Committee's attention. An article in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> relates to an amendment on special schools that the Committee discussed last week. I seek a ruling from you on the article, as it makes serious allegations about Conservative Members. The article reports that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), Opposition spokesman on Scottish education, visited the Mary Russell school in Paisley with his Labour colleagues on this Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot take a point of order during a point of order. That would be extraordinary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is alleged that yesterday's visit to the Mary Russell school was
	<br><blockquote><p>"the start of a campaign to bring Scottish attention to the amendment".</p></blockquote>
That refers to the amendment on special schools, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and me, and which was accepted by the Minister. The report states further:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that 'libertarian group', led by Allan Stewart, the Conservative Member for Eastwood…put forward the amendment."</p></blockquote>
I wish to stress that I tabled the amendment in response to an amendment tabled and subsequently withdrawn by the Opposition. If the Opposition had not tabled and withdrawn that amendment, the amendment tabled by me would not have become part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made a point of debate. I suppose that he is satisfied that it has been put on record. I cannot deal with allegations that are made against hon. Members outside the Committee. If the hon. Member requires redress, he can use the means available to him as a Member of the House. He is an experienced Member, who is adept at doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. It is disturbing that the proceedings of the Committee are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
being traduced, not by the press, but by members of the Committee. The report suggests that special schools may charge fees, yet my hon. Friend the Minister has stated that that is untrue. The Opposition have, therefore, attempted to mislead the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has not added anything to the point of order that was raised by his hon Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 152, in page 12, leave out lines 9 to 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 64, in page 12, line 16, leave out paragraph (a) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) whose contract of employment terminates on the day immediately preceding the incorporation date or who before that date—
	<ol>
	<li>has been appointed or assigned by the education authority concerned to work solely at another school as from that date, or</li>
	<li>has been withdrawn from work at the school with effect as from that date, or</li>
	<li>has given notice in writing to the education authority of his intention to remain in the employment of the authority.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 137, in clause 23, page 23 13, leave out lines 40 and 41.</p>
	<p>No. 138, in clause 23, page 13, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Nothing in subsection (1) above shall prevent a teacher employed by an education authority making application to the authority for transfer to another school or prevent the authority from granting such an application, even where the school in which the teacher is currently employed is one in respect of which the authority has received written notice under subsection (6) of section 13 of this Act from the school board.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee is discussing staff, I shall take the extraordinary step of presenting the Minister with gifts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. The hon. Member cannot give the Minister gifts during the proceedings. He should also not walk in front of the Chair, because if he does so, I cannot see what is taking place. I dare not make any ruling, however, because I once received a haggis from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie). It proved that haggis makes good eating, if nothing else.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to embarrass the Minister. He set the Committee a test recently, which the Opposition have been unable to cope with, in order to win a bottle of whisky. In the spirit of glasnost, however, my hon. Friends and I felt that it was appropriate to bring the Minister a jar of marmalade, which was prepared by the children of the school that we visited yesterday, and a tape of the children's songs, the first side of which is entitled, "To the Ogre". We have also given him a
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
comprehensive selection of the Strathclyde material on the structure of education, delivered in a Strathclyde regional council bag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forysth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for the gifts. He is not a Greek, and I certainly do not fear him. It is helpful to have a copy of the Strathclyde report. Could he also obtain the school boards material that Strathclyde regional council produced? We were surprised to read in the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> that those proposals were rejected, after the great commitments that the hon. Gentleman made in committee,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should return to amendment No. 152 before we go any further with marmalade, tapes, the proceedings of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, and the rest of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Surely that is relevant, because the only person with marmalade all over his face is Councillor Gray, following the attack on him yesterday by Councillor James Mackechnie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No matter how distinguished the office that Councillor Gray holds, he is not a member of this Committee, and references such as that made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) are not helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. As a simple Back Bencher, I am worried that the Opposition Front Bench should indulge in theatricals and publicity gimmicks. I want the matters before the Committee to be properly debated and I am disturbed that the Opposition Front Bench should set such an example. A Back Bencher behaving in that way would be described as a maverick. How can Back Benchers hope to get any work done with mavericks on the Front Bench?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always impressed by those who subscribe to the work ethic. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has made his point and I ask the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) to continue his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 21 deals with teaching and non-teaching staff, and the conditions for employees when a school transfers to self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have mentioned in earlier debates how much the Opposition value the contribution of all school staff, especially teachers. The conditions of employment, career prospects and ethos of a school are crucial to morale, the teachers' commitment and the quality of the children's education. The amendments seek to bring common sense to a Bill that creates anomalies and raises worries for teaching in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Committee, and between the parties, teachers bear the brunt of abuse, anxiety and, sometimes, contempt. There are about 50,000 teachers and an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
enormous number of non-teaching staff who contribute greatly to the quality of Scottish education, and the subject should be raised well beyond the Committee. The Government may say that the Labour party and others always support school staff. We say yes to that unashamedly—not because of our vested interest, but because staff are themselves an important vested interest for the benefit of their pupils. Attainment and success in primary and secondary education hinge critically upon the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will wish to contribute to the debate in more detail. I wish to address myself to, and justify, the specific amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 152 amends clause 21, which empowers the Secretary of State to designate any visiting employee irrespective of the number of hours spent in the school. For example, a peripatetic music teacher might spend one morning in the school out of a whole working week spent in other schools managed by the authority. It is important to secure such a teacher's continued service to the school, but it is surely wrong to place him or her under the jurisdiction of a board of management rather than the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause tackles the issue in the wrong way. It would be better to provide that the education authority must continue to provide the services of part-time staff rather than empower the Secretary of State to compel the transfer of employment on the basis of only a few hours' work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 152 is straightforward and it balances the interests of continuity of education in the self-governing school, the host education authority, and the employees. It is right to argue for protection of employees during a period of turmoil, and we might return to that issue later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of amendment No. 64 is to provide freedom, protection and flexibility for employees after the opting-out ballot is under way—a crucial period for school and staff. The amendment expresses the Opposition's anxiety that employees might be transferred against their own interests and aspirations to a school with very different characteristics from that in which they were employed before the incorporation date. An education authority is obviously different from a board of management of a self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Career prospects will emerge as an important issue. Such prospects—and I emphasise the word "may"—be much better under the authority than under the board of management. An employee should be able to reflect on prospects in order to make a judgment about them. The Opposition are also worried that a teacher might object to working for an employer whose approach to education is different from that of the authority. Our anxiety about that is linked to clause 28, which allows the characteristics of the school to be changed through a ballot. A member of staff involved in a transfer may face uncertainty two or three years later as a result of clause 28, when, before, the characteristics of the school were, to all intents and purposes, similar to those that he enjoyed under the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
The argument is about natural justice for the employee and educational efficiency. An individual should have the right to remain within the education authority sector. We are talking about two sets of circumstances—the school in which the teacher finds himself, and his status and contract with the education authority. The best balance could be struck by allowing an employee to have the best of all worlds, where he can make a judgment about the relative merits of career prospects either in a self-governing school or under an education authority. That is not an unreasonable request to be made on behalf of an employee who makes a valuable contribution. It has nothing to do with national or local politics or the internal politics of a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have painted a picture in which an employee could be adversely affected by a school's move to self-governing status, but clearly the opposite may happen. However, the balance of our judgment is that certain factors may reduce the quality of long-term career prospects and conditions of service if an employee moves to a self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 try to tackle the question of transfer. At present there are contractual obligations in Scotland between employees and the employing authority—the education authority. Those obligations, which have evolved over many years, try to strike a balance between educational efficiency, the children's interests and the proper safeguarding of employees' rights. We are concerned about the freeze on staffing provided for in clause 23, which could last for at least three months and possibly much longer. It seems to be an encroachment on individual freedom for a system to freeze the movement of staff at a school, or adversely to affect the movement of staff within an authority, on the assumption that that school is remaining in the education authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are pluses and minuses to the issue. We have talked about the positive aspects, but circumstances may arise in which the dismissal of a teacher is actively considered by the parties providing education. We have touched on safeguards for teachers, but we must be more specific. If employees are drawn into the freezing of movement and transfer and end up being employed by an opted-out school, that constitutes a major threat to their status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We sincerely hope that the Government will be flexible in considering this clause, linked to clause 23. If not, teaching and non-teaching staff will be justifiably worried about their future. It should be left to the Secretary of State to discuss the issue further with the education authority, the teaching unions and people involved in education before a judgment is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are unwilling to accept the amendments, we ask for further consultation. We have tried to thread that characteristic through our debates in Committee, but there has been very little consultation. However, if the Bill becomes law, there may be activity on that front. When dealing with enormous numbers of staff in potentially sensitive situations, it is sensible for consultation to be held before legislation is drafted and therefore difficult to change, rather than to alienate support and generate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
fear among employees in Scottish education, by passing legislation that provides no scope whatever for consultation, especially in regard to the freeze process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is significant that in a speech lasting quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, the principal Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), spoke a great deal about teachers but not about children. Schools are primarily about educating children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, teachers have rights and duties. They have as much right as Members of Parliament, dockers or lawyers to have recourse to the redundancy laws and to be paid due compensation if their services are no longer required. But I must say to my hon. Friend the Minister that I am not entirely happy with the present drafting of clause 21, and neither is the hon. Member for Fife, Central, although we perhaps approach the problem from different angles. I am not happy because the clause requires the entire contract of employment to be transferred intact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One purpose of the Bill is to give real powers to parents and boards of management. The transfer stage will provide an opportunity to wipe the slate clean. No doubt the boards will wish to retain most members of staff, but some staff may be surplus to requirements, may not have made the grade, or may be unsuitable in some other way. After all, the boards will act only in the interests of the school and the pupils. The purpose of the Bill is to give powers to the boards including, if necessary, the power to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch. That is why I am not entirely happy with clause 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's amendments are impractical, particularly amendment No. 64. I do not think that an education authority would thank the hon. Member for Fife, Central if his amendment were passed. It is impractical because it gives teachers the right in a transferred school to remain in education authority employment even if there may not be sufficient places for them once the school is transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises an interesting question on contracts of employment. Of course we accept that, as a minimum, the contract of employment between the employee and the education authority will be carried over, but an interesting front is being opened up. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will tell us whether, in wiping the slate clean, he foresees that a teacher may have to move to worse employment conditions, or does he think that an opted-out school will be able to provide better employment conditions for such a person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that on a later clause. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, may we look to the English example? Evidence there suggests that teachers who have been retained in opted-out schools can look forward to better salaries and conditions. The Education Reform Act 1988 gives such schools the right to increase salaries above the national pay scale. I cannot speculate on the conditions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
employment, but I must be honest and frank with the hon. Gentleman, as he would expect me to be. I believe that the philosophy behind the Bill is to give much more freedom for manoeuvre to school boards. In the real world, as such schools will be in a competitive market for the best teachers, it is extremely unlikely that opted-out schools will give their staff worse conditions of service. That is possible, but it is extremely unlikely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are moving into interesting territory. The hon. Gentleman touched upon the English experience, which has been a major feature of the debate, and he talked of the possibility of English schools being able to pay above what is euphemistically called "the going rate". In Scotland, the national negotiating machinery impinges upon contractual obligations, conditions of service and salary. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that that machinery should be, to use a crude word, "scrapped," to ensure that the market operates more clearly than it does now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn along that path, but I do not see why opted-out schools should not be in an analogous position to independent schools. They should have the power to enter the market to purchase the best teachers, by offering conditions of service and salaries that are not available in other schools. That is my view: I do not know whether it is that of my hon. Friend the Minister. However, if my hon. Friend has thought through the Bill and its philosophy, he must seriously consider not requiring opted-out schools to take on existing contracts of service, with all that that entails. For that reason, I hope that he will reconsider the clause before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for dashing out of the Committee Room during the speech of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). I am serving on another Committee down the corridor, where we were less successful today than on Tuesday when we defeated the Government. We have just been beaten by 16 votes to six. The Tube strike has had its impact on the number of Labour Members present down the Corridor and in this Committee, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle berated my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) for not mentioning children. But when we spent many hours debating special education, most Conservative Members never mentioned children or special education. They spent almost the entire time talking about how the Opposition tabled their amendments. It comes amiss for the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle to criticise members of the Committee for forgetting that the Bill is about children, because that is what most Conservative Back Benchers have done. They are not interested in the Bill's impact upon children's education and chances in life. The Opposition are concerned about that. That is what motivates our speeches in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued by the suggestion of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncaśtle that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
was wrong for the Minister to provide that contracts should be the same when people are forcibly transferred from the education authority into self-governing schools. The hon. Gentleman also raised the possibility of redundancies taking place in the same way as they would affect dockers and bus workers. So far, the Minister has not suggested the possibility of staff redundancies in opted-out schools, but it is interesting to see that it is in the mind of Conservative Back Benchers. They are seeking a provision for boards of management to be able to sack staff when they move from education authority control to being under the direct control of the Minister. Perhaps, they want a charter for the Minister to sack troublemakers in a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle mentioned "wiping the slate clean" and dealing with staff who did not "make the grade". Those who have worked in Scottish industry understand what employers mean when they use such terms. In the employers' eyes, troublemakers may be shop stewards or, in this case, representatives of the Educational Institute of Scotland, and we know that the Government hold that union in low esteem. Ministers would be keen to see boards of management sorting out EIS representatives by accusing them of not coming up to the mark. I am sure that that is what is in the mind of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will beleive me when I say that that was not in my mind. I do not know whether what the hon. Gentleman has suggested would happen, but I give him my word that I was not thinking of it in those terms. We are all aware that some teachers are better than others. If an opted-out school is to achieve the high standards that it wants, it must have the right to employ the best teachers in the market place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that I was thinking not of schools getting rid of troublemakers, but of not so bad or not so good teachers not having a job for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the hon. Gentleman's remarks in that way, because I have obviously given him a new idea. He was careful to say that he did not disagree with the idea—it was just that he had not thought of it. I should not have put that idea into his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy to judge who is a good teacher and who is not. I spent many years in the classroom and it is not easy for outsiders—particularly those on a board of management who may have no experience of what constitutes a good teacher—to decide which teachers are useful for the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I taught, there were people who decided that if a teacher's class was noisy, the teacher was bad and not doing his or her job. That is wrong; sometimes the most education takes place in noisy classes. They might look chaotic to the outsider, but the teacher knows that interreaction and good education is going on all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HMI would be the first to say that it is not easy to judge who is a good teacher. To introduce
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
such a simplistic notion into the debate shows that Conservative Members are out of their depth when trying to deal with Scottish education, of which they have little or no experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that if the boards of management were allowed to renegotiate contracts, they could pay above the rate and attract what the hon. Gentleman described as the best teachers. Throughout our proceedings, the Minister and his colleagues have repeatedly denied that self-governing schools will attract better teachers or make better provision than other schools. Conservative Members argue that such schools will not divide education, but improve it. They argue that such schools will no detract from the schools that remain under education authority control. Yet the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle let the cat out of the bag when he said that the Government want to attract the best teachers from the surrounding schools under education authority control to the self-governing schools. The hon. Gentleman is arguing that the best teachers will move to the directly funded sector, so the poorer teachers, by his definition, will be left in the education authority sector. That is the sort of two-tier education system which many have warned about and which Conservative Members have refused to accept is a possible result of the Bill. It does not make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) talked about the best teachers being recruited to the schools, implying that the poorer teachers will teach children in other schools in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman did not deal with that issue. In fact, from his statement, he does not care if the poorer teachers are teaching other children. The hon. Gentleman is interested in a minority of children, not in all children in Scottish schools. Does my hon. Friend agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. That is precisely the type of motivation that exists among Conservative Members. They are not interested in all children in Scottish schools, but only in a small elite who they think come from the same political culture that the Conservative party represents in England. The Government want to reestablish grammar schools and to re-establish division in Scottish education, by having some schools that they believe will be better than the other schools offering education to the vast majority of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is attacking my point of view in vitriolic terms. Our purpose is to set a standard of excellence that will raise the standard for all schools, teachers and children. We may have to introduce some of the disciplines of the market place, but that is what raises standards. The Labour party never seems to realise that. Labour Members believe that we should lower standards to make everyone level. That is not our philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every time that the hon. Gentleman opens his mouth, he puts his foot more deeply into it. It is difficult to argue with someone who believes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
that education should be in the market place. Education should not be in the market place. Market disciplines about which the hon. Gentleman talks, lead to the cut-price, cheap and shoddy goods that are flooding the markets in this country at present. That would happen in education if it were left to the same forces. The cheapest would be pushed forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks of raising standards of excellence everywhere, but he wants to attract the best teachers away from education authority schools into separate schools in a different sector. How will that raise standards? By the hon. Gentleman's definition, standards will slip. His argument is false and bogus and does not convince the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) should abandon the debate on educational philosophy and return to the amendment under discussion. The point was worth airing, but it is a trifle out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to return to order now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments recognise the importance of ensuring that contractual conditions remain the same when teachers are transferred into self-governing schools. Conservative Back Benchers suggest that the Minister let them down because he will not give boards of management the freedom to renegotiate contracts when schools acquire self-governing status. Clause 7(1) describes the powers that boards of management will have, which include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to enter into contracts, including in particular contracts for the employment of teachers and other staff."</p></blockquote>
There is no point in giving that power to a board of management if it cannot exercise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses say about clause 21:
	<br><blockquote><p>"each individual's contract of employment will continue to apply with the single change that the board of management replaces the education authority."</p></blockquote>
But that refers only to the point of transfer. Thereafter, boards of management retain the power to enter into contracts with staff. They could exercise that power the following year and easily renegotiate the contracts of the individual members of staff, having honoured the letter of the law in clause 21, but also using the spirit of the law in clause 7, which allows them to undermine the negotiated contracts that members of staff have at the point of transfer. I hope that the Minister will reply to that. It is important that members of staff in self-governing schools should continue to benefit from the national negotiating agreements, which are conducted in Scotland at national, and not at school, level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that boards of management could put out to competitive tender the contracts of non-teaching staff and set their own specifications for those contracts. It would be feasible for boards of management to put out to tender the work of janitors, cleaners or secretaries, to sack staff with or without redundancy—nothing in the Bill protects the interests of staff regarding redundancy—and then bring in an outside contractor who would perform the work at a much lower standard. We are worried about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. The Opposition were led to believe that conditions of service covering teachers nationally would be maintained, but an element of doubt has been thrown into the debate this morning. Will my hon. Friend comment on the impact on the education authority sector and on teaching generally if an opted-out school worked in the market place with no adherence to national negotiations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. If self-governing schools are allowed to step outside the nationally agreed conditions for teachers—the Bill also gives them the power to attract private sector funding—they will have a better resource base than the education authority on a per school basis. They may be able to offer higher salaries to teachers of particular subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, there is a shortage of classics teachers in Scotland. When I was a regional councillor in Kirkton, children could not learn classics at Kirkton secondary school but had to travel to a school on the other side of the city, because there were insufficient classics teachers in the city. If a self-governing school decides to major in classics and to attract all the classics teachers in the city, children who attend education authority schools will be denied the opportunity of learning classics because of the operation of the Bill under market conditions, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle described them. What protection will there be for subject levels, to ensure that teachers are not all milked away?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always thought that the Labour party wanted teachers' wages to be increased. The hon. Gentleman's argument is that, if opted-out schools pay over the odds, that will be unfair for the state system. But the very existence of that new, free market will be an incentive to pull up wages in the state sector. Opposition Members must recognise that the opted-out sector will be the driving force that will create the wages market for teachers whose subjects are in demand. To retain a teacher in the state system to teach classics, those wages must rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolute rot and humbug. There is no free market. Education authorities cannot pay whatever they choose because they are under the direct control of the Minister, who dictates how much money they will have to spend in any given year. They do not have a free hand to follow the private market and pay whatever it demands. Their hands are tied behind their back, whereas the hands of the self-governing schools have been loosened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman favour paying teachers, for whatever reason, more than the standard rate? Are there not instances where teachers should be paid' more because of expertise, special abilities, or shortages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a complex matter. There may be individual cases in which teachers should be paid more, but in principle I am opposed to it. When I

	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
first became a teacher, I had to choose between joining the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association or the Educational Institute of Scotland. The SSTA said that secondary teachers should earn higher wages—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members at the back of the Committee are now talking so loudly that I cannot hear the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). I wonder whether they could keep their voices down, if they feel that they must talk to one another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to explain that I do not share some people's view that teachers in a particular discipline or sector of education should look after themselves and get what the market can give them, and never mind other teachers. I have always thought that teachers should stay together and try to get the best deal for teachers as a whole. I accept that there are differences among teachers—clearly, secondary teachers have a case for arguing that they should be paid more than primary teachers—but they can obtain the best results by working together through nationally negotiated agreements that apply to all schools. I should think that that is also the Labour party's approach, although I am not always completely up to date with the latest party policies, as it is difficult to be so these days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the way in which the rights of members of staff have been undermined, without their having been given any say. Schools will obtain self-governing status through a ballot of parents and the decision of the Secretary of State for Scotland. At no point in that process are staff members balloted. The only ballot in which they are allowed to take part is to elect a staff representative to the board of management. The decision to take the school and their employment from the control of the education authority is completely out of their hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the direction of labour. If it were happening in Poland and General Jaruzelski were directing people from one part of the economy to another, the Prime Minister and Conservative Members would be up in arms, shouting for Solidarity and saying, "This is a shocking tyranny." Yet, when it happens here, they call it freedom and extending choice. There is not much extension of choice for members of staff who wish to remain within the education authority's control. Amendment No. 64 allows for that freedom of choice to be given back to members of staff. In its final subparagraph, it provides that a member of staff would be excluded from the effects of the Bill if he had
	<br><blockquote><p>"given notice in writing to the education authority of his intention to remain in the employment of the authority."</p></blockquote>
Surely someone should have a right to say, "I want to continue to work for the education authority which took me on and gave me a contract in the first place." We cannot take that right from people. The Bill would give parents the chance to ballot and take away the individual's right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about what will happen when the transfer takes place. There are some disciplines for
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
which there are too many teachers. Over time, subjects realign and change. For example, history and geography are now being challenged by modern studies, and there is a continuous realignment of history and geography teachers, the role of modern studies in the curriculum, and so on. There might not be another job inside the education authority area to which a member of staff could be transferred, and, as a result, the only alternative might be for that member of staff to go under the board of management in the self-governing school or to resign and go on the dole. If members of staff resign, they will be immediately disqualified from benefit for having voluntarily given up their employment. Of course, they will not have voluntarily given up their employment; they will have been forced to do so by this Bill and by the Government, the Minister, and many Conservative Back Benchers who must deal with that important problem which exists in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter must be cleared up. The EIS, the SSTA, the National Union of Public Employees, the Transport and General Workers Union and anyone else who represents workers employed in education authority schools will be looking to the Minister to give cast-iron guarantees that their conditions of employment will not be altered at the point of transfer to a self-governing school and that they cannot be altered other than through the nationally agreed conditions and agreements for education authority schools. Employment conditions and salaries for self-governing schools must be the same as those for education authority schools. That is the sort of guarantee that we seek, and I look forward to the Minister's reply in which, I trust, he will give exactly that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on this series of amendments has illustrated the wide philosophical gulf that exists between Conservative and Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) has accused Conservative Members of being concerned for the direction of labour, but there is nothing more central to the direction of labour than all the policies that have been advocated by the Opposition. They want a system of rationing of teachers, by direction from the centre—from the education authority—and a system of total uniformity extending to salaries, which does not allow for any differentials to be paid to teachers with special skills or to especially skilful teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accusation that Conservative Members are not concerned about children is absolutely false. We are the members of the Committee who are concerned about children. We recognise that a concern for children translates into a concern that the staff who will be teaching those children will be the best staff available in any school. The idea that, somehow, the market is to be resisted is also false. Wherever the market operates, it operates to increase standards. For example, competition in the food industry creates the highest standards of public hygeine in the provision of food. The same applies to education; competition between schools in the independent sector results in a general raising of standards.

	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
Conservative Members are concerned for the children, and that concern translates into concern for the staff. It is right and proper that the Bill should also relate to the interests of staff in self-governing schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend speculate on whether there has been a shadow Front Bench reorganisation?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I not only heard your words of wisdom, Mr. Hogg, but saw your demeanour when you delivered them, I feared for my life if I responded to the enticement of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). I had noticed that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was not in his place. I am sorry, as he moved the amendments, and it would be helpful if he were present to listen to our comments on them. However, clearly he has gone to Strathclyde to sort out the Labour party's problems there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that it is right and proper for the Bill to apply to the staff. Under the Bill, the staff have the right to opt out of a self-governing school and find employment elsewhere. However, my hon. Friend the Minister has made no provision for a self-governing school to make a similar choice. It is effectively a one-way system, and I share the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) that this is not the right way in which to proceed. As he said, the purpose of according self-governing status to the schools is to enable them to have much more control over their own destiny. Yet we are proposing—certainly initially—to deny those schools any freedom of movement. Although the staff are given the opportunity of exercising their freedom of choice, the newly-appointed self-governing board will not be entitled to exercise its choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's theory that staff have freedom of movement. He was referring to subsection (2)(a)(ii), which gives staff the freedom to withdraw from a school if they do not wish to go under self-governing status. Does the hon. Gentleman think that it is strange to write that freedom into the law through the Bill, while legislating that any staff who take advantage of the provision will be denied unemployment benefit for voluntarily having left their employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would leave only if they had some alternative employment to go to. The hon. Gentleman is saying that, if they wish to continue in local authority employment, the amendment will oblige the local authority to find a place for them, regardless of whether there is any real work for them to do. I thought that we were moving from the system of employing people in non-jobs. People who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
anxious to find work would not be satisfied by simply being employed in what is effectively a non-job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) on wiping the slate clean were slightly misinterpreted. He said that some staff might become surplus to the requirements of the newly self-governing school. That is a practical consideration to be taken into account. It is not a matter of wiping the slate clean—that gives the wrong impression. A school may decide to become self governing because the parents wish the school to adopt a certain ethos and to concentrate on a special area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to the competing demands of modern studies, history and geography. Parents who are worried about education authorities' policies may wish schools to return to a proper study of the history of these islands. Some schools do not always give that subject the priority that parents wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The self-governing school may need to take on an additional member of staff to satisfy parents' demands, in accordance with the new charter of the school. Another subject may be given lower priority, and the staff employed to teach it may not have a job under the new arrangement. There may be no place for that member of staff in the new self-governing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Faced with those circumstances, most members of staff would look for another job. Some may not wish to do so, and will find themselves staying on at the school, because the Bill gives them the right to have their contract renewed. That would be a mistake. There should be provision for the self-governing school board to decide that certain members of staff are not required, and schools should not be obliged to continue the contract of employment which those members of staff enjoyed with the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members may argue that that measure would simply put people on the scrap-heap, but the more self-governing schools there are, the more differences of emphasis there will be in the charter of each school as each appeals to the requirements of different sets of parents. Therefore, it is more probable that a teacher whose skills are not required in one will be required in another. The measure is not simply intended to get rid of troublemakers, although I see no reason why a self-governing school should start out encumbered with someone who is not in sympathy with the ethos of the school and simply wishes to make trouble. He may be an appointee or agent of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. Does the hon. Gentleman interpret the Bill as saying that any self-governing school has to recognise teachers' unions in that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Self-governing schools would have to maintain the best possible relations with teachers. They may seek to ensure that by requiring all teachers to be members of the EIS or another union, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
schools should be able to decide that for themselves. I do not believe in the closed shop, which is a fundamental difference between the Conservative party and the Labour party. To require a teacher to belong to a union should be no business of a self-governing school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree, therefore, that it would be wrong for any board of management to enter into a single union agreement with, say, the Professional Association of Teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The deputy general secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers is one of my constituents, and he is a very able man. It is singificant that PAT was not only founded by a great friend of mine, but is the fastest growing teachers' union in the country. That demonstrates the inadequacy of the main teachers' unions to provide the professional status and job satisfaction that a growing number of teachers want. Self-governing schools should enter into single-union agreements with PAT provided that they do not produce a closed shop so that a member of PAT would be debarred from a job at a school. It is up to the board of management to decide who to employ. Under the Bill boards are empowered to enter into new contracts. We are discussing the transitional arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the plea to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that he should give due weight to the legitimate responsibility of self-governing school boards to exercise discretion and freedom of choice. Why should those schools be locked into a contract of employment with a teacher who is neither in sympathy with the ethos of the school nor has a useful role to fulfil in a self-governing school which lays new emphases? I hope that my hon. Friend will resist the demand of the hon. Member for Dundee, East that cast-iron guarantees should be given. It would be a mistake to give such guarantees. The future prosperity and job satisfaction of the teaching profession in Scotland will depend on the diversity of self-governing schools. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will not only resist the amendment, but will make further provision to enable self-governing schools to select their own staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 152, 64, 137 and 138 would correct the deficiencies in the Bill. Amendment No. 152 would delete lines 9 to 13. As it stands, the clause empowers the Secretary of State to designate visiting employees, even if those employees spend only a few hours in the school. A peripatetic music teacher might spend one morning a week in the school and the rest of the week in other schools managed by the authority. While the importance of securing such a teacher's continued service at the school is recognised, it would be wrong for the teacher to be in the employ of the board of management rather than the education authority. The clause tackles the issue in the wrong way. It would be better for the education authority to continue to provide the services of a person who works part of the time at a school rather than empower the Secretary of State to compel the transfer
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
of employment on the basis of a few hours' work a week.

The hon. Members representing English constituencies have shown their true colours this morning on the transfer of staff. They have writ large the model that they want for Scottish education. It is a political deception for them to be on this Committee supporting a Bill to provide self-governing schools when they do not want any schools in the public sector. They want the market place to run amok and for teachers and pupils to find their own way. It is political hypocrisy on their part even to support the Bill because their comments this morning have shown that they want a different system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly misunderstands the intentions of Conservative Members. The Bill provides some of the market mechanisms to make schools more responsive to parental wishes. That was recognised by Strathclyde regional council, and we were told that it was Labour party policy five years ago. It has taken five years to emerge but it now rejected, following the intervention of the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues.

The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Howarth) said that contracts should be allowed to be rewritten and that self-governing schools should be able to decide which teachers to employ. He is concerned with the minority and not with the majority of pupils and teachers in Scottish education. He knows nothing about how schools work in Scotland or about their environment. Talking about good and bad teachers is the wrong way to approach the problem. An educational institution depends on the quality of its teachers and the relationship between teachers and between teachers and pupils. After a year in college a probationary teacher might be a bad teacher but, given the correct guidance from head teachers and fellow members of the department, could grow in the job. Teaching is not just a matter of deploying academic skills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not tell the Committee that there are no bad teachers. It would be like saying that there are no bad Members of Parliament. The hon. Gentleman must recognise that in all professions there are some who fall far short of the standards necessary to do the job effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there are good and bad Members of Parliament, but that does not mean that someone who is considered to be a bad teacher should be discarded. Everyone in a school must be allowed to develop. It is a shallow view to believe that we should discard people. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
is not our business: we should try to get the best out of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can claim to know something of developing and helping people. I ran a large organisation, employing many people. As a practice, we did not discard people, but we recognised that some were not up to the job in which they were employed. Fortunately, we could often move them to other posts, but in education that does not happen to the same extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. He said that he was in the fortunate position of being able to move people. The Bill, by making every school autonomous, would make the possibility of transferring people more remote. The hon. Gentleman defeats his own proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When an individual is not suited to being a teacher, employing authorities have little opportunity to move them because of the terrible constrictions and the narrow parameters of what the profession requires teachers to do. That is not so in a large, complex business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Teacher training colleges weed out poor teachers in the first instance. Then, when teachers enter schools they must be members of the General Teaching Council and must meet the standards that have been set. I know of schools were teachers have been given the sack because they have not made the grade. The mechanisms exist already. The Minister might be surprised, but it is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle will be a delight to us in the coming months in Scotland when contracts are renegotiated. Does the hon. Gentleman envisage a school with a core staff and that others will be taken on part-time? If he wants his market model applied to education, he should consider employment levels in industry when similar contracts of service are lost. His model would be a gross violation of the current position in Scottish schools. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is suggesting that everything should be turned upside down and that contracts of employment and national negotiations should disappear. He would leave individual schools to employ teachers and allow some schools to pay more than others. I have considered the position of other deregulated industries and it shows that the ideas of the hon. Gentleman are pie in the sky. He has ripped the veneer away be telling us what his views really are. I thank him for that and we shall use his words extensively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that my view is that head teachers should have the power to hire and fire. I am not embarrassed by that and, even if it is not the view of the Minister, I have no hesitation in expressing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has just be reselected. Does he suggest that standards in professional work are improved by giving people jobs for life?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I do not. The hon. Gentleman claims that the Bill will impove Scottish

	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
education, but he is creating discord by recommending the hiring and firing of staff. Surely we should build on to what we already have without causing the fracture that the hon. Gentleman wants. He hs a minority opinion—thank God for that. I am glad that it does not percolate to the Government Front Bench—[Hon. Members: "We are not so sure."] I shall come to the Minister later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 64, paragraph (aa)(iii) seeks to insert a provision that an employee who
	<br><blockquote><p>"has given notice in writing to the education authority of his intention to remain in the employment of the authority.'."</p></blockquote>
should be allowed to do so. It is unacceptable for an employee to be transferred, willy-nilly, to an employer of an entirely different character after the incorporation date. There will be many differences between an education authority and the board of management of a self-governing school. For example, the career prospects for teaching and non-teaching staff will be better in the education authority than in a board of management. When a board of management is floated off from an education authority's remit, it will stand on its own and opportunities for staff to move will be restricted. Teachers who are transferred from education authorities, particularly from regions such as Strathclyde, which is large, will no longer have the chance to move around to get experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers are better if they have the chance to gain experience in different localities. I do not suggest that I was a better teacher because I moved about, but I worked in APT—area priority treatment—areas, which were designated by the education authority as deprived areas. I also worked in Bearsden and Milngavie, so I experienced different educational environments, and that was helpful. Teachers in self-governing schools may not have such opportunities if the Minister does not accept our amendment. Teachers employed by the education authority may wish to stay with the authority and to allow them to do so is the least that the Minister can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, a teacher may have a conscientious objection to working for an employer whose approach to education may be different from that of the education authority. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle wants market forces to rule. Some employees may not wish to work for a school board governed by market forces and we should allow them to exercise their conscience on the matter. That would make for a less fractious atmosphere in the school, as the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 deals with the change of characteristics of a self-governing school. The ethos of a self-governing school may become different from that of its predecessor under the education authority. Natural justice and the interests of educational efficiency and harmony demand that an employee of an opted-out school should have a right to remain in the employment of the education authority and to be redeployed in another school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions for the transfer of staff from an education authority to a self-governing school are inequitable. No system of self-governing bodies exists at present; school boards are statutorily excluded
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
from acting as employers. Objections could lodged and school boards may be challenged in industrial tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a contradiction between the wording of clause 23 and clause 21(2)(a). There also appears to be a contradiction between clause 23 and section 75(3) of the Education Reform Act 1988. At present, almost all teachers employed by education authorities have letters of appointment that state that they are liable to be transferred to another school run by the education authority. An authority's powers of compulsory transfer have been much used in recent years and are seen by education authorities as an essential management tool, particularly in areas with falling rolls where teachers have to be redeployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In outlining his proposition for the market place, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that some teachers may be surplus. There are surplus teachers now in many Scottish schools. For years education authorities have consistently spent more on education than the Scottish Office guidelines suggested because they were concerned about the quality of provision. There will be surplus staff but our amendments Nos. 137 and 138 would give education authorities latitude to deal with that problem. In fact, during the next 10 years the secondary school roll in the Strathclyde region will fall by about 40 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The freeze in staffing provided for in clause 23 will last for at least three months and may extend for longer, depending on how long the Secretary of State takes to decide on an opting-out proposal. During the freeze, vacancies in the school may not be filled and its teachers may be prevented from applying for promotion in other schools. Dismissal of a teacher may also be impossible, regardless of circumstances. There would be no doubt about the position of a teacher whose name has been removed from the register by the General Teaching Council. It is entirely unsatisfactory that the only body with power to waive restrictions is the school board. That disregards the rights of education authorities as overall managers or the rights of individual teachers and members of non-teaching staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is enough for the Minister to ponder. If he cannot give an answer instantly, will he consider those arguments and reply later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that it boils down to a question of principle of freedom of choice for the teachers concerned? It would be entirely wrong if teachers were transferred like chattels from an education authority to a new kind of school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Earlier someone mentioned the Minister's philosophical instincts. Those instincts would surely be in sympathy with those of his Back-Benchers because he puts so much emphasis on freedom and choice. I commend him for the fact that he sees some sense in the present provisions, but I should like him to go further and respond to our fears on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. The role of preventing any backsliding in the

	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
Committee on these provisions has been taken on by several of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) crystallised the key issue. My hon. Friend for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) said that the options open to us in dealing with staff were either to start with a clean sheet whereby the board of management of the self-governing school could determine the staff it wanted, or to protect the position of the staff on transfer. Although my hon. Friend put a persuasive case based on the Bill's philosophy, in reaching a conclusion on the best way to deal with the matter, we have sought to protect the rights of the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are in a muddle over the amendments because some of their arguments got dangerously close to the view of my hon. Friend for Gainsborough and Horncastle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) is surprised, but Opposition Members seemed to suggest that staff should have a choice in the matter beyond what is already provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complicated area, but the position is straightforward. When a school becomes self-governing, no one will have to apply for his or her own job, as often happens now when an education authority reorganises its schools. Equally, no one will be prevented from accepting a post elsewhere if he wishes to dc so. For the staff who remain, contracts and continuity of employment will be guaranteed. Their pay and conditions will be the same, their pension rights will be safeguarded and their professionalism will be fully recognised. There will be no question of bringing in unqualified or unregistered teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want all teachers, not only those in self-governing schools, to have fair and open career prospects. Job vacancies should be properly advertised and open to all qualified applicants. Applications should be fairly considered so that candidates can compete on an equal footing. At present, education authorities can reserve jobs for their own teaching force and refuse to consider applications from people who have left teaching but wish to return to it, teachers from independent schools or those employed by other education authorities—but those days are numbered. Teachers should be free to widen and enrich their experience and the best should gain promotion. That can only be healthy for the school system as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend's arguments were attractive, it is essential that the new self-governing schools should create a basis for stability. I hope that he will understand why I am unable to accede to his demands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand. I am dissatisfied with that reply. Why should not self-governing schools have the right to take on the best staff? Why
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
else would they become self governing? My hon. Friend the Minister has not given me one reason why he believes that my arguments are false.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) says that he is with me; perhaps I should rethink my position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about what happens at the point when a school becomes self-governing. The board of management will be able to determine the composition of the staff and reorganise if it considers it necessary to do so. The key point is that the staffs employment rights will be protected. The daft policies of areas such as Strathclyde have meant that at some schools there has been a surplus of teachers in some subjects and a shortage in others. That makes it difficult for the education authority to match the supply of teachers with a school's demands. A self-governing school that inherits such difficulties might wish to alter the mix of the staff or make additional provision in some subjects. It would be free to do so, but if it wished to make teachers redundant it would have to take account of the teachers' redundancy and employment rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. I agree with what my hon. Friend said about redundancy rights, but is he saying that a self-governing school will be able to make a teacher redundant if he is surplus to requirements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is what I am trying to get across to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. Although it is regrettable, some education authorities employ surplus teachers because they operate a nil redundancy policy. When teachers are transferred to self-governing schools they will have the same employment rights but, equally, the board of management will be able to make the provision that it considers proper. Redundancies will incur costs, and the board of management must take account of those costs as well as the overall needs of the school and the position of staff when taking any decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle may feel that the clause does not represent the pure position that he would like, the spirit of the clause is that the board of management will be free to manage the school as it thinks appropriate, subject to the duties placed upon it, and it provides some security for the staff concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister missed out an important point about teacher shortages. How can self-governing status resolve the acute difficulties that exist in relation to specific subjects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the position again. Some schools have a surplus of teachers in particular subjects and a shortage of others, but the total number of teachers reflects the education authority's policy on staffing. There may be three history teachers when only two are required and one mathematics teacher
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
when two are required. Education authorities operating a no redundancy policy at a time of falling rolls cannot match numbers of teachers to pupils. It is not that there is no teacher who could be recruited for the subject for which there is a shortage, but rather that the education authority's policy in response to the blandishments of the EIS and others represents the trade union view rather than the children's interests. A self-governing school will be able to operate a policy that reflects the school's needs and to break free from such a position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confuses the issue. Many Scottish education authority schools face acute shortages of teachers of specific subjects, which they simply cannot attract. The problem is not about minuses and pluses between history and geography teachers, but concerns a real shortage of teachers of subjects such as physics, mathematics, business studies and technology. The bulletins published by the Scottish Office detail those problems. Will the Minister tackle that problem? Self-governing schools will not be able to harmonise that balance more efficiently, because the teachers with those specific skills are simply not available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says is nonsense. The 1988 figures for the excesses and deficits of secondary school teachers in Scotland—if one of my hon. Friends cares to table a written question, I shall be happy to answer it—show that there are excesses of teachers in every subject listed except computing and religious education. There is a shortage of six in religious education and of eight in computing. The hon. Gentleman mentioned business studies, in which there is a surplus of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those shortages do not exist as a result of numbers of teachers; the problem has largely been caused by the policies pursued by the education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has touched the nub of the problem. It is not about the overall numbers of teachers, but about attracting skills that do not exist. That impinges on the problem of teacher training. One cannot take surplus maths teachers and convert them overnight to fill the shortage of history teachers. Self-governing status would not affect that essential problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. There is no shortage of maths teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was citing an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is recalling the position that existed before the Government took office, when there was a shortage of 104 mathematics teachers in Scotland, while today there is a surplus of 20. There was a shortage of 131 technical education teachers, and today there is a surplus of 50. Perhaps he was thinking of physics; there was a shortage of 75 teachers, and there is now a surplus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that that is not the issue. What is the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to think that, if one does not accept what he says, one must be confused. We are not talking about teacher shortages in the way that has been described. The Minister claimed that self-governing status may help to resolve the teacher shortage. The Minister has said nothing about the real difficulty of teachers with specific skills that are in demand being either non-existent or in short supply. How will self-governing status help a school to attract teachers in even the limited areas he has talked about, when we would argue that they do not exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no shortage at present. If we take the total figures for say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Religious education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in religious education there is a shortage of six teachers, while in computing there is a shortage of eight. However, in all subjects together there is a surplus in Scotland of 629 for 1988, while in 1987 it was 380. In 1979, the surplus was 55. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therein lies the problem which my hon. Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) sought to address with regard to contracts automatically being transferred to self-governing schools. Clearly, from my hon. Friend's figures, there is a surplus of teachers. If a school votes to take self-governing status and to opt out, that school has part of that surplus of teachers. What incentive does the school have to make those teachers redundant—if redundancy is necessary—when it will be costly? We are dealing with the dock labour scheme, which affects my constituency, by giving up to £35,000 per docker, from the Government. There will be a problem in transferring the contract automatically to the self-governing school, in cases where the school wishes to deal with the problem of surplus teachers. Who will bear the cost of expensive redundancy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks difficult questions. The board of management would need to take a view on the matter. If an application were made for financial support for reorganising or restructuring on becoming self-governing, we could provide for that purpose through the special purpose grant provisions in clause 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to conclude the point, as it has been suggested that we make progress. We have had a debate about volume and about numbers in the education authority sector.

machinery. I have just answered my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), who asked where the money would come from. Education authorities such as Strathclyde with no redundancy policies—in the light of declining school rolls, people opting out of a school using the parents' charter, and the number of pupils being reduced—must maintain a quota of teachers. With a no-redundancy policy, it would be impossible for them to deal with fluctuations in certain subjects. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has written to me about that subject on several occasions. In Strathclyde, although the total number of teachers is correct, the balance between subjects is wrong, and, because of the no-redundancy policy, nothing can be done about it. That is the problem. A self-governing school would not be subject to the kind of strictures that result in perfectly sensible policies—which may even carry the endorsement of the leadership—being rejected by the narrow political interests which run the education authority. There is a good example of that on the front page of today's 	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which shows that, even with a committed and far-seeing leadership, it is not always possible in an education authority to get the required support.

The interests of the board of management of a self-governing school will be related much more to the school than to the wider political considerations that might result in bad decisions which are not to everyone's benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I are relieved that my hon. Friend the Minister has confirmed that self-governing schools will be able to make staff redundant and, in certain circumstances, will be compensated by the Government for so doing. But I am not yet entirely happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the school re-organisation with which I was connected, the fact that teachers were forced to reapply for their jobs in the reorganised schools allowed the new schools to turn over a new leaf and to become excellent. I do not understand why teachers must apply for their new posts if school reorganisation is imposed by local Government, but retain their contract of employment when their school becomes self-governing. My hon. Friend the Minister has gone some way towards calming our fears, but I still do not understand why there is a distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering the arguments, the Government took the view that it was right to ensure that, in the transfer to self-governing status, stability was maintained among the teaching staff. We believe that self-governing schools should not be seen as a threat to the employment rights of the many dedicated professional teachers in our schools., It would have been a mistake for us to have done what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle has mentioned. Apart from anything else, it would have given Opposition Members something that they desperately need—a basis on which to argue against these provisions, which look to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
best interests of children, teachers and the broader community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked about the shortage of classics teachers. I am not aware of any such shortage. There is, in fact, a surplus of classics teachers at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to a particular school.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) talked about making staff redundant. After the incorporation date, when the board of management decides the school's complement of staff, will there be an opportunity for negotiations between the board of management and the local authority on taking any teachers whom the self-governing schools consider as surplus to requirements into the employment of the local authority without any break in their conditions of service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly a possibility for such a negotiation to take place. The hon. Gentleman is asking me to go deep into the inner sanctum of employment law. If teachers wish to leave a self-governing school on transfer, they could resign. If they were re-employed by the education authority within a month, they would retain their employment rights. Any transfer which took place within 28 days would be on the same basis. As the Committee is anxious to proceed, and my note on the point runs to four pages, I shall write to the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) explaining the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments should not be accepted. The basic flaw in amendment No. 64 is that it would be unfair to education authorities. We do want to be unfair to them in any way. When a school becomes self governing, the education authority will relinquish all its responsibility for the school. It will not be in the position of employing anybody there. In the extreme case, if the entire staff opted to remain with the education authority, the authority would be put in the intolerable position of having to find posts for them all, regardless of whether it needed them all or not. My understanding, from discussing the matter, with directors of education, is that they recognise that the provisions in the Bill are reasonably fair. I am sure that they would have found the proposal embodied in this amendment most unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the provisions of the Bill give the fairest possible means of dealing with the situation when a school passes into new management. There is nothing in the Bill that affects the right of any employee to resign from his employment. The Bill leaves it open for the education authority to transfer staff into or out of the school, during the period when the application for self-governing status is pending, provided that it has the consent of the school board. I should expect that school boards would always
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
agree to reasonable proposals in that regard. I should certainly advise them to do so. Nevertheless the consent of the board should be sought and obtained. For that reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 137. In any case, even if a board were to dig in against a transfer of a member of staff out of the school—if it was the wish both of the individual and of the employing authority that he should move—it would always be possible for that member of staff to resign and accept a fresh offer of employment by the same authority in a post elsewhere. In short, the staff at a school that is in the process of becoming self governing have the same right and freedom to seek employment elsewhere as they would at any other time. That is the thrust of amendment No. 138, but in the light of my explanation, I hope that the Committee agrees that it is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 152 would remove the provision that the Bill makes for determining what is to happen to staff who are employed for part of their time at the school. That practical issue must be resolved. If there is no provision such as we have here, there will simply be endless dispute, in which the members of staff concerned will stand to suffer most. We have, therefore, provided that the Secretary of State, who in this matter will be a disinterested party, should make the determination; and he would, of course, take account of all the circumstances. The amendment would simply leave the school and the education authority to haggle, and I cannot accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton was right to point out that area of difficulty. We must resolve the matter sensitively, and I have every confidence that the Secretary of State will be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I urge Opposition Members not to press their amendments. Their anxieties about the rights of staff are covered in the Bill. If I cannot convince them of that, they should listen to my hon. Friends, who clearly think that the Bill has gone too far in providing security for staff. I think that the Bill represents a good and sensible balance, which enables the board of management to work with a stable, motivated teaching force and to make the necessary management decisions in the best interests of the pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would preserve the status quo in Scottish schools, because it would ensure that only registered teachers—teachers who have successfully undertaken an approved course of teacher training—could be employed in schools. The Bill would allow exceptions from time to time as prescribed, which would allow the Secretary of State for Scotland to extend into Scotland the proposals on licensed teachers for England and Wales. The concept of licensed teachers may be alien to hon. Members from Scottish constituencies. It seems strange that the Government are determined not to license dogs but are equally determined to license teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, a licensed teacher could be a person who has the necessary educational qualifications to undertake a course of teacher training but would be allowed to teach pupils without having taken that course. In other words, someone would be allowed to teach in schools without first having been trained to teach. That is an important factor for the Committee to consider. I know from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
direct experience that teaching is about far more than teaching the subject; it is about teaching pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well recall my experience when I left St. Andrews university with an honours degree in modern and medieval history. I had majored in such obscure subjects as the medieval origins of Parliament and the history of political theory from Plato and Augustine through to John Stuart Mill. I even did a special project on medieval Beverley. If I had gone straight from there to teaching at St. Saviours high school in Whitfield in Dundee, I would have struggled somewhat; to relate Plato and Aristotle to the children from Whitfield is not as easy as some Conservative Members may think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty in relating Aristotle to what we are doing here. Will the hon. Gentleman speak to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks are relevant, because we are discussing whether someone can go straight from university to teaching, without attending a teacher training course. I tried to show that it is important to undertake a teacher training course to become familiar with the realities of teaching in schools and the levels at which subjects must be taught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I joined the history department of St Saviours high school in Dundee, the third year was divided into those who wanted to do history, geography and modern studies. The principal history teacher took all those wanting to do history, the principal geography teacher took all those wanting to do geography, and, being a brand new member of staff, I was given all those who did not want to do anything and who were thrown into the modern studies class. I had never heard of modern studies. That is the reality of teaching in schools, so it is important that people undergo a proper course of teacher training, which enables them to teach at levels that pupils can understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As every politician knows, it is easy to talk over the heads of an audience. It is equally easy for teachers to speak over the heads of pupils, not to relate to their level, and not to teach subjects in terms that they can understand. It is vital that graduates are given an introduction to teaching through teacher training courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to coping with the pressures that exist in classrooms. It is absurd to suggest that licensed teachers can come from the rare atmosphere of a university, walk into schools of mixed ability pupils, have to face difficulties in class, be able to take control immediately, and relate to pupils as though they had been doing it all their lives. Teacher training provides practice teaching posts. I was sent to Arbroath high school, to Linlathen high school, and to a school in Dundee. I was given a chance to be with another registered and qualified teacher, and I was easily broken into the atmosphere of the class, and shown how to relate to the pupils and how to deal with any problems that arose. Some people
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
decide then that teaching is not the profession for them and that they will never cope in the classroom, so they drop out, without harm to the pupils involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for licensed teachers mean that people would be thrown into classrooms, without the help of an experienced teacher, and be in charge of the teaching on their own. The whole structure could collapse in farce. The teacher would suffer, but, more important, the children would suffer. If a class dissolves into farce, chaos and disruption, the children suffer. It is important to have a year of teacher training so that individuals have time to acclimatise and to learn about the complexities of teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teaching is complex. The teachers in the Committee will recall lectures on education theory in teacher training college. Other hon. Members might scoff at education theory, but it is an important part of teaching. It was at teaching training college that I first came across a man called Maslow, who taught me about the hierarchy of needs and about how children could not be expected to do logarithms or to learn about medieval history if they were hungry or had not slept all night, or if their parents were on drugs. To appreciate how best to help and teach children, a teacher must understand each child's family circumstances and stage of development. Teachers coming straight from university would not have the chance to learn about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EIS—the hairs on the back of the Minister's neck will stand up at the mention of it—has put forward good arguments. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The wording of the clause represents a substantial departure"</p></blockquote>
from the paper issued by the Scottish Education Department, entitled "Self-Governing Schools—Extending Choice for Scottish Parents". That paper stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Self-governing schools remain part of the state sector of education. As such they will only employ teachers registered with the General Teaching Council."</p></blockquote>
The clause would allow the Secretary of State to depart from that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, education authority schools cannot, in any circumstances, employ teachers who are not registered or, at least, provisionally registered with the General Teaching Council. If a teacher is guilty of misconduct, his name is removed from the register and education authorities cannot legally employ him. If the clause remains unamended, the position in self-governing schools will be different. They will be allowed to employ teachers who are not registered with the GTC. Registration guarantees teaching standards and ensures that teachers guilty of misconduct—unfortunately that happens occasionally—can no longer be employed in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would strip away those safeguards. Graduates from universities or other institutions of higher education would be allowed to walk straight into the classroom. Whether they are registered or are able to teach the subject would be immaterial.. Provided they have qualifications, a self-governing school could employ them. We do not wish to see that. Conservative Members argue that they wish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
to see self-governing schools raising standards of excellence, but if the clause is accepted, unamended, such schools could lower standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall talk briefly about amendments Nos. 55 and 56. They have the same aim as that mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). We wish to ensure that registered teachers are employed in schools, irrespective of how the schools are managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, we know that a teacher registered with the GTC has the appropriate qualifications and has been trained. The hon. Member for Dundee, East described the type of training that he and I undertook to be able to teach in secondary schools. There are other forms of training for those entering primary education. Again, time is spent at a teacher training college and in going to schools for practical experience. I believe that a B.Ed from Stirling universiy can teach in primary or secondary schools. Therefore, the qualifications can be obtained by a variety of means. However, we all recognise their importance, and no one can be registered with the GTC witout taking appropriate academic and practical training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of School Masters/Union of Women Teachers has pointed out that some opted-out schools might find difficulties in recruiting teachers for some subjects and that the clause would allow such schools to employ untrained and unregistered teachers. In response to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), the Minister listed some figures to show that there was no shortage of qualified teachers. Surely, if that is so, why should the Bill contain provisions to enable schools to offer jobs to people who do not hold qualifications? Occasionally, there may be geographical difficulties in ensuring that the available teachers go to all parts of Scotland. Regional variations exist. My area has difficulty attracting teachers of commerce and business studies, which will be vital because of information technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We touched on the issue of registered teachers on 4 April when I moved amendment No. 74 to clause 7. I have reread what the Minister said then and it worries me. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations which will arise under clause 22(1) will contain terms similar to those which currently apply to public schools under the 1980 Act." 	<i>—{Official Report,</i> First Scottish Standing Committee, 4 April 1989; c.281.]</p></blockquote>
It is the use of the word "similar" that worries me. If the Minister is committed to ensuring that only registered teachers are employed in schools, he should have used the words "exactly the same as". I checked the relevant sections of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Section 135(1) clearly states that only registered teachers must be employed in Scottish schools and section 90 reiterates that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to clause 22(1), the notes on clauses, which the Scottish Office kindly provided for members of the Committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations may make provision for exceptions to a general requirement that teachers be registered."</p></blockquote>
What are those execeptions? When we debated this issue earlier, the Minister made great play of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
fact that he and Raymond Miquel were considering attracting professional football and rugby players into schools to assist in sports activities. Presumably he will expand on that and say that the exceptions will be only in extra-curricular activities. However, many teachers voluntarily give up their time to help with extra-curricular activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a clear guarantee that non-registered teachers will not be employed for academic subjects because that would be the slippery road to a reduction of standards in Scotland. The General Teaching Council is the envy of many countries because of its high standards and the fact that it provides clear guidance on how to deal with teachers who do not observe the basic principles of working in schools. Some professional qualifications are interchangeable in the Common Market, but many of our European counterparts are considering establishing an organisation such as the GTC because they are so impressed by the way in which it has maintained educational standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give a commitment that only registered teachers will be employed. By using the word "shall" in amendment No. 55 we are no doubt making it a complex linguistic debate about the exact implications of words, but our meaning and the amendment are straightforward. We want no diminution of standards in our schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment I shall refer to some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about the importance of training for teachers, but first I want to query the wording of the clause. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) usually asks the questions about wording. I am not as erudite as the hon. Gentleman, but I am puzzled. It seems that part of subsection (1) may be redundant. Why is it implied twice that there may be regulations? Subsection (1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be prescribed that only registered teachers shall be employed … subject to such exceptions as may from time to time be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary to have two sets of regulations? It would be simpler to begin that subsection with "only", which would retain the option for alternative arrangements. It would simply establish a status quo that only registered teachers will be employed, but it would also be countenanced within the Bill that from time to time the status quo of registered teachers could be altered by regulations. Given that that would be the effect of the subsection if it began with "only", it is odd that it is introduced with the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be prescribed that".</p></blockquote>
I disagree with amendment No. 55, tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), in which she suggests that "may" in that opening phrase be replaced by "shall". If it has already been decided that only registered teachers will be employed, why not just say that? Why do we need further regulations to prescribe the status quo?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even from the Government's view, it would be much simpler to begin the subsection with "only"
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
and then leave the remainder of the sentence as it is, if they wish to keep the full effect of the subsection without accepting our amendment. The subsection as drafted would require a fresh set of regulations to fulfil the promise implied by the opening words. We would have to reconvene to discuss those regulations, and another set of regulations would then have to be drawn up to cope with the final phrase of the subsection, which hints that from time to time exceptions would be prescribed. It would be a waste not only of our time but of taxpayers' money to have us reconvene, with all the help that we need. As the Government always say that they are anxious to save taxpayers' money, will they accept that they could easily begin subsection (1) from the word "only", and still achieve the affect that they want? It would simply establish the status quo that they intend to establish, without us all having to reconvene. I hope that the Minister will explain why that would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress the importance of training for teachers. Until recently the Government agreed with that. The Department of Education and Science issued a paper on self-governing schools extending choice for Scottish parents. Paragraph 5.4 of the annex of that paper stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Self-governing schools remain part of the state sector of education. As such they will only employ teachers registered with the General Teaching Council."</p></blockquote>
Why has the Minister changed his mind? Conservative Members like to say that Opposition Members change their minds about certain amendments, but the Government have changed their mind on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East suggested that without adequate training, teachers in quango-managed schools may lack necessary teaching skills. They may have all the requisite information and knowledge to write a good examination paper, but unless they have specific teacher training there is no guarantee that they will make adequate teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I taught in a university for which a teacher needs no specific training. I was not a good teacher. I seemed to have the same effect on my students as I have on Conservative Members. My experience made me realise the importance of proper training for people who are to impart their knowledge to others. Teachers have to be trained in communication skills, and in the skills required to relate to pupils and identify their needs. They have to avoid the trap that teachers often fall into of addressing the common mean of understanding rather than the diversity of aptitudes and interests in a class. That could have the undesirable consequence of pupils who are having difficulty or who are way ahead of the teacher on a particular topic getting insufficient attention. Teachers can fall into that easy error, particularly those who, like myself, have had inadequate training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
Given that Conservative Members often say that they are anxious to avoid uniformity in teaching and to structure teaching so that it can relate to individuals and zero in on the needs of pupils, they should understand our anxiety to provide teachers with adequate training. Writing a research paper or providing oneself proficient in a specific skill does not mean that one is well equipped to convey those skills to others. That applies as much to sporting knowledge and information as it does to more esoteric and academic forms of knowledge and information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that specific training is not as necessary to some forms of knowledge, but I would not agree. Simply because one is a good footballer, for instance, does not mean that one can impart adequately that skill to youngsters. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will support me in that because, in his day, he was a soccer player of considerable proficiency and skill. That was demonstrated during our school visit yesterday when he tried to communicate to some of the children there the skills that he had acquired through the bounty of nature. But his attempt was notably unsuccessful. From a spectator's point of view, he committed the error that talented people who have had no training in how to impart their skill commit too readily. They assume that others have the same natural or innate ability as they have in the subject that they are trying to explain. My hon. Friend tried to show the children how to spin a football on an extended finger. It was very impressive and reminded me of the spinning globe on which we are all—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
