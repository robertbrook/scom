BALLOT OF PARENTS ON QUESTION OF ACQUISITION OF SELF-GOVERNING STATUS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 104, in page 8, line 11, leave out from "whole" to end of line 12 and insert,
<br><blockquote><p>"of such expenses in respect of the ballot as have been reasonably incurred by the Board".—<i>[Mr. McAllion.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing the following amendments: No. 105, in page 8, leave out lines 13 and 14.</span></p>
<p>No. 189, in page 54, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"7. The education authority shall pay or reimburse the school board in respect of the whole of any expenses properly incurred by them in connection with or in contemplation of any legal proceedings arising out of the holding of the ballot, whether or not the proceedings are in fact instituted.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before lunch, it is vital that we give financial protection because those who will carry out the provisions must know that they will not be landed with expenses. Therefore, I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).<br><br>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth): I hope that I can be of some help. I acknowledge what my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) says. Moreover, now that the proposers of the amendment have agreed to withdraw it, I suggest that the Committee vote down the amendment. I give an absolute assurance that we shall table amendments to reflect the Committee's wishes and the undertakings that I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Question must be put; no Division is necessary.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the surface, it seems that clause 14 must stand part of the Bill if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
self-governing schools are to exist. The only basis on which they can be created is by the democratic process—everyone being given the opportunity to cast a vote in a ballot. No one on Opposition Benches would disagree with that.<br><br>
However, we should take the opportunity of this debate to highlight the unsatisfactory nature of the clause. The Minister was unable to assure us that ballots on whether the school should opt out would not be held annually. He said that it was not for members of the committee to second-guess how parents might act in a given situation. He then went on to second-guess how education authorities might act and assumed that they would interfere with parent's rights to decide whether they wanted a school to achieve self-governing status. His remarks were therefore contradictory. The Minister conceded that it was technically possible that annual ballots would be held as a result of the clause, but said that he had confidence in parents' better judgment and was sure that they would not use the Bill to impose annual ballots on a school.<br><br>
The majority of parents in every school are concerned about their children's prospects, and the last thing that they would wish is to have their children's education disrupted by a series of annual ballots, however, it does not take many parents to force the ballot procedure into operation—only 10 per cent, of parents are required. Where there are 150 parents of children attending a school, it would take only 15 of those parents who were disgruntled enough, to ensure that a ballot was held every year, because the majority decision had gone against them and they were unprepared to accept that.<br><br>
During our discussions of the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, I suggested that by putting a contentious issue such as elections into the arena of education, there was a danger that political parties would run candidates, so elections to school boards could become party political—as they used to be under the ad hoc system before the introduction of education authorties. Although the minister conceded that my suggestion was possible, he said that he would do nothing about it and that it was up to the Opposition to table amendments to disallow political parties from fielding candidates for election to school boards.<br><br>
I did not accept the Minister's argument because I always assumed that it was the Opposition's job to oppose a measure that they thought to be bad for Scottish education. That is what we are doing. We are trying to highlight the dangers. If the Minister is prepared to impose a school board system on Scotland with the danger of involving party politics in schools, it is his responsibility to do something about it. We know that some political parties in Scotland take a disruptive attitude to almost everything Scottish and even attempted to disrupt the beginning of the Committee's proceedings. They could quite easily force annual elections in schools across Scotland that are fought not on the basis of what is good for the school, but on the basis of what is best for that individual party.<br><br>
The Minister is leaving a loophole in the clause that allows schools to be subjected to annual ballots
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 639</span>
and to annual party politicking by different political parties that want to influence the direction in which individual schools in the community may go. The Minister has done nothing to try to close that loophole.<br><br>
The Minister said that boards of management would never allow such an eventuality because their members would be up for re-election. But he forgets that most parent board members will hold office for four years and at the end of that period, as their children probably will have moved on, their interest in that school will have moved on accordingly and they will have no interest in being re-elected. They will be interested only for the period that their children attend the school. Therefore, there is no potential electoral check on some parents who do not take the long-term interests of the school into consideration. Clause 14 has a serious loophhole and that is reason enough for the Opposition to press the stand part debate to a Division.<br><br>
The Minister assured us also that he would introduce an amendment on Report to yield to the principle suggested by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) in amendment No. 189, that when a school board was challenged in court by an education authority, the education authority would be responsible for the legal costs incurred by the board in trying to fight the injunction that might be sought against it. I do not accept that principle. Education authorities are careful of their actions, particularly in Scotland. I speak with some experience, as a previous convenor of Tayside regional council. Senior legal officers, particularly chief executives, give careful and cautious advice to every council. Few councils go against the advice of their chief executives. That is the Scottish experience, and is certainly the experience in Tayside. When our officers told us that what we were doing was illegal, impossible and an abuse of legislation, we took their advice seriously. It is unlikely that education authorities in Scotland would take school boards to court without good cause. They would listen to their chief executives and their senior legal officers and would judge what was the best action for the council to take.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting his view on the record on behalf of the Labour party. But why have we in England experienced vexatious litigation on the part of Labour-controlled local education authorities? They have carried out the precise activities that he assures us will not happen in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Throughout our proceedings, members of the Committee have referred continually to the English experience. The hon. Gentleman does not know much about Scottish education. We have a different tradition. I would not for a moment suggest that I have deep knowledge of the English experience, but I know its background. I accept that, in the main, it is a matter for English hon. Members to debate and resolve as best they can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 640</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I shall finish my point. I can vote on legislation that affects education in England as the hon. Gentleman can vote on legislation that affects education in Scotland. That is a practical reality with which I must live. However, I do not accept that that is the proper way in which such legislation should be handled. A Scottish Parliament should be set up in Edinburgh to decide legislation on Scottish education. I look forward to the day when an English Parliament is established in the midlands or the north of England to decide legislation on English education under a federal system within the United Kingdom. That is my ambition. Until that happens, I must live within the limitations of this place and, as a member of the Opposition, I shall vote on English Bills. But I have never believed, and never will believe, that that is a good process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows about the operation of regional councils, as do other Opposition Members. But does not believe that a deterrent in the Bill would, in itself, ensure that there was no vexatious litigation? If education authorities are required to meet the costs of such action, they will think twice about their activities. If the hon. Gentleman is so confident that such litigation will not occur in Scotland, the provision will not be implemented. Therefore, there is no case for him to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with the matter. If vexatious litigation is pursued by an education authority in Scotland—that is, the taking to court of a school board without good reason—the court will decide the matter and, in so doing, it will award costs. I should imagine that it would award costs against the regional council and the education authority so that they would bear the costs of the legal defence of the school board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that would be possible. The argument of the hon. Member for Tayside, North covers the position where a case is justified on the part of the education authority and when a board did not heed its advice or that of the Secretary of State for Scotland to mend its ways, otherwise it would be taken to court. What would happen if the board dug in its heels and asked to be taken to court, which then decided in favour of the education authority? The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the education authority should pick up the tab of the legal defence when the board was simply being vexatious. I have not heard him deal with that. However, during his speech on his amendment, I had to vote in a Division in another Standing Committee, so he might have dealt with it when I was out of the Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing against what I have heard for many years from Opposition Benches. Individuals who are threatened by a large organisation—the Opposition usually argue that it would be the Government or an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 641</span>
organisation in the private sector—are impeded from taking court action because of the fear of its costs. I said during my speech that I did not wish to go into detail about the merits or otherwise of a specific case. I was dealing with principle. If the hon. Gentleman is now arguing that ordinary people should not be assisted or sure of such assistance if they have become caught up in a legal wrangle, he is speaking contrary to everything that I have ever heard from Opposition Benches about legal aid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I am saying. I well understand that the little man often finds himself up against major forces, such as the private sector, which is not accountable to anyone. The Government are not accountable in Scotland, so the little man should be protected against the abuse of power that takes place in Scotland daily by both the Government and the private sector.<br><br>
Education authorities are elected bodies. Every councillor must stand for re-election in the local council elections. If they behaved in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Tayside, North, they would be quickly brought to heel by the electorate. No political party has the right to expect the Scottish people to support it. Parties must win and earn support in Scotland. If education authorities— whether Labour, Tory, Liberal or anything else— abuse the rights of the small individual in Scotland, they will answer for it at the ballot box. The Scots like to defend individual freedoms and liberties, which have been sadly lacking in Scotland during the past 10 years while the Government have been in office and have abused their powers. They have abused the rights of not only the little people but the majority of people in Scotland.<br><br>
Clause 14 has many faults and I do not believe that it should stand part of the Bill as it has enormous loopholes and great potential for creating problems in Scottish schools that the people in Scotland clearly do not want.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
The danger is that the Bill will politicise Scottish education in a way in which English education has been politicised for years. I regret that. Scottish education has a consensus across the political parties, outside the Tory party, such as the Scottish National party, the Social and Liberal Democrats, the Labour, Communist and Green parties. Those parties have a consensus about comprehensive education and how to invest in better schools, so that everyone has equal opportunities and the chance of the best possible education. The Conservative party is not happy with that. The Government are introducing contentious legislation to disrupt that and to put at risk the education and future of Scottish children. That is why we are so bitterly opposed to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note with interest that the Government rejected amendments Nos. 189, 104 and 105, but that they intend to table amendments to cover those issues on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government believe that theirs will be better-drawn amendments. That gives me some hope that, despite my amendment about the times between which ballots could be held being rejected, I, too, could return to that issue on Report. I have been in the House of Commons for only a short time, but I learn something every day. I should be interested to know the procedure that ensures that if the Government reject an amendment, they can table another on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a bit of a meal of the matter. It is usual procedure in which both the Opposition and Government indulge. Often a Minister will say that he accepts the spirit of an amendment but that it is technically deficient. It is a usual procedural device that the amendment must be withdrawn so that a new amendment can be tabled on Report. Many is the time that Opposition Members have been given commitments by Ministers who have said that an amendment was technically deficient and that if it were withdrawn, the Government would table their own amendment on Report. That is a normal procedural device and there may be many occasions when the hon. Gentleman will benefit from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman, but I thought that the Committee had voted against the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had to, because I spoke. If an hon. Member speaks after another hon. Member has asked the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are on the stand part debate. Hon. Members must not go into too much detail on those amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. Perhaps it would be appropriate on a point of order to you, Mr. Martin, as you bring greater authority to such matters, to ask you to confirm that when any hon. Member speaks after another hon. Member has sought to withdraw an amendment, it is necessary to put the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to educate the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Mcdonald). He is expected to find such things out before he joins the Committee. If he followed procedure, he would know that that is what happens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that was what happened. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) rather put his foot in it by speaking after his hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) sought to withdraw his amendment, thus forcing the Committee to a vote on the amendment, which was rejected. I shall take that to heart.<br><br>
When the Minister reformulates amendment No. 189 and tables it on Report, how will education authorities provide the money necessary to cover the legal expenses? Will central Government make the money available? If so, will it be part of the general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
grant or will a specific grant be made for legal actions incurred by schools that opt out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that it will be a significant sum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From what Conservative Members said, I fear that it will be a significant sum. They have a vision of Scottish education authorities being so vexatious and ill-tempered that they will resort to such devices. That is why they wish to ensure that the provision is in the Bill. Given that that is what Conservative Members think, can the Minister say how education authorities are expected to raise the money to meet the cost of legal action?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin my speech on clause stand part by dealing with that point.<br><br>
I asked the hon. Gentleman whether he thought that the sum would be significant, because what is involved are the legal expenses incurred as a result of a school board opting for self-governing status. As the Gainsborough question—which has become like the West Lothian question—in the Committee remains unanswered, and as the Opposition have not hinted at the number of schools that they expect to go for self-governing status, it is difficult for me to judge the scale of the matter. Education authorities are already responsible for the legal costs incurred by school boards. It is in respect of school boards seeking self-governing status that there is a need to strengthen the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong to say that we have given him no idea of the number of schools that we expect to take advantage of the Bill once it becomes law. As I have said many times before, the answer would be none if the Government made it impossible for schools to reintroduce selection on academic grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not quite grasped that. The hon. Gentleman is arguing that the ability to introduce academic selection is necessary to make opting-out a popular concept. That is a surprising statement and it is not backed up by evidence. It does not square up with what he told the Committee about people's views on academic selection and with what we have heard about the position in England. I read out large sections of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> article, which stated that English schools were considering taking self-governing status in order to escape political interference and bias from the local education authority to obtain managerial freedom and autonomy and to preserve their existing character. Either something odd is happening in the Western Isles or the hon. Gentleman is out of touch with popular opinion. No doubt he will form his own judgment about that.<br><br>
Before I was sidelined, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) reminded the Committee of the contribution that he made during the proceedings on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, when he said that boards would be party political and I expressed the hope that political parties would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 644</span>
keep out of school board elections. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman went to the Labour party's conference in Inverness, but, from what I saw on television, a resolution was passed that suggested that the Labour party should become actively involved in school boards. I assume that the hon. Gentleman rooted against that because of his view, which I share, that there should be no party political involvement in the boards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister shares my view, why did he not do something on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill to ensure that political parties could not become involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the reasons that the hon. Gentleman will find if he reads the reports of the Committee stage of that Bill, and for those that meant that the hon. Gentleman was unable to table an amendment to achieve that aim.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East also referred to the series of ballots that would arise as a result of the clause. He said that every year a small minority of parents would propose a ballot and that every year they would lose. If such a group of parents existed and acted without good reason, their support would dwindle. However, if the parents gained more support until they were able to achieve a majority, they would be unlikely to succeed in convincing my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to agree to a proposal for self-governing status. Clearly, the conditions would not exist to make that successful. What benefit could there be in parents behaving so irrationally and irresponsibly? I do not believe that that will happen. My hon. Friends the Members for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) and for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) pointed out that there are serious disadvantages in restricting the opportunities for ballots beyond the one-year interval proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, after the Bill is enacted, the Minister is still in office—which I sincerely hope he is not—will he tolerate annual ballots for three or four years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on what the hon. Gentleman means by annual ballots. If there were a ballot for two consecutive years, it might be for a very good reason. If only 49 per cent, of parents supported the proposal, but a year later circumstances had changed, making it possible to obtain a considerable majority, annual elections would be appropriate. The hon. Gentleman suggested that that would happen year after year, but there would be no purpose in that. It would not result in more people voting. Even if it was possible to obtain a majority after a series of annual elections, a Secretary of State would need to take into account the obvious division within the school.<br><br>

The hon. Gentleman is asking the Committee to reject clause 14, but we have already had this debate on the amendments. He wants me to imagine every conceivable situation in every school in Scotland and

write a Bill to account for that. We are unable to do so. It is better to rely on the good judgment of the school board and parents than to introduce rigidities, which could have serious consequences for schools that might legitimately want to hold another ballot within a 12-month period.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although amendment No. 175 is in keeping with the spirit of the other amendments, it was tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston), so I would not presume to speak to it on his behalf. I shall speak briefly to this group of amendments, not because they are not important, but because I hope that Conservative Members will accept the principle contained in them.<br><br>
I shall explain the differences between the amendments because such a large group can be confusing. Amendment No. 26 states that individuals who have the right to vote in a ballot for self-governing status should include parents at other schools
<br><blockquote><p>"which are regarded by the education authority as associated with that school in terms of transfer of pupils from primary education to secondary."</p></blockquote>
In other words, parents of children in primary schools that have a tradition, which is recognised by the education authority, of sending pupils to secondary schools that are being considered for self-governing status should have the right to vote.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 16 to 25 are technical adjustments to schedule 3 to make it conform with the change made by amendment No. 26. Amendment No. 167 is in the same spirit. Parents who are eligible to vote in a ballot for self-governing status should include:
<br><blockquote><p>"the parents of every child, being a child of whose existence"—</p></blockquote>
I have inserted the missing word "of in the amendment—
<br><blockquote><p>"the authority are aware, who would be expected to be in attendance at the school within two years from the date of a notice"</p></blockquote>
to hold the ballot. The parents of children who are expected to go to a school which is to undergo a ballot should have the right to vote in the ballot.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 168 and 169 deal not with a ballot for change to self-governing status, but with the right to vote in a ballot that would change the characteristics of a self-governing school. The same principle applies—parents whose children are expected to go on to self-governing schools should have the right to vote in any ballot determining the future characteristics of that school.<br><br>
The amendments have the effect of increasing the number of parents who are eligible to vote in a ballot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 647</span>
to make a school self-governing and also to change the major characteristics of that self-governing school. The electorate should be widened because it makes common sense that parents who have a potential interest should be allowed to vote in ballots. That also makes democratic sense.<br><br>
One could argue that parents whose children could reasonably be expected to go on to a self-governing school or a school about to become self governing have a greater interest in the future of that school than parents of children who are about to leave it. If it is right for parents with children in their final or penultimate year at school to vote whether that school should become self governing and whether it should change its characteristics, given that their children could have left by the time that any changes were made, it should also be right for parents with children at primary school who are expected to go to a secondary school which is being considered for self-governing status to vote in elections that vitally affect the future of the school. It is common sense to extend the franchise in that way.<br><br>
Amendment No. 167 would bring the Bill into line with existing provisions. When a local education authority recommends that a school is eligible for closure, it is incumbent upon that authority to consult not only the parents of children at the school, but the parents of children who could reasonably be expected to attend the school within two years of the suggested closure. Therefore, it must be right for such parents to be not just consulted, but given a vote in the future of any school being considered for self-governing status or considering a change of characteristics.<br><br>
This is especially important when one change of characteristics could be the introduction of selection on the grounds of academic ability. That could lead to the exclusion of children who otherwise could reasonably expect to attend that school. Any such change of characteristics should be subject to the influence and vote of the parents of children who may potentially be excluded. Again, that seems to be simply democracy and common sense. I hope that Conservative Members agree with me about that.<br><br>
It is important that Conservative Members consider these proposals seriously and appreciate the need to bring a wider group of parents into the decision-making and voting progress. That would go some way—although not all the way—towards meeting the criticisms of those who believe that one of the major flaws of the Bill is that it excludes the wider community interest from the fate of a school. If the decision about the fate of a school were to be taken also by parents with children in other schools, but who have a direct interest in it, the wider community interest could be brought into the democratic process. That is especially true of rural schools where there is frequently little alternative to a particular secondary school for its surrounding feeder schools. If it decided to opt out, the parents of children at the feeder primary schools would be in a difficult position, and their freedom of choice would be restricted. Those parents whose children would be directly affected by such a decision should also have a right to participate in the taking of that decision.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 648</span>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I want to be brief because I am keen to hear what Conservative Members have to say about the group of amendments and whether they embrace the democratic principle that they contain. I hope that they are in favour of widening the franchise so that parents of children who would be about to enter the school could also be included in the quite fateful decisions that will be made by democratic ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the attractiveness of the idea that one could define a constituency of those parents with a future interest in any school contemplating self-governing status who should therefore be given a say in the ballot. As the hon. Gentleman has just explained, some of these amendments try to identify a set of individual parents with a future interest. Some define other schools where all parents should be involved in the ballot. Others leave the issue to be settled parent by parent. The Opposition amendments in particular depend on a very rigid view of which pupils will in future attend which school. Such a view is not borne out by the facts. Under the parents' charter, in many urban areas well over one in six pupils entering primary or secondary education do not attend the school designated for them by the education authority. In the face of movement by parents on that scale, it is simply not realistic to believe that one can define precisely those with a future interest in the particular school considering self-governing status.<br><br>
That is one compelling reason why the ballot is confined to parents of the well-defined group of those who have children actually in attendance at the school concerned. The other main reason is that they have the closest interest in the school. That approach does not ignore the wider interests of other parents and prospective parents. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that they have a legitimate interest and should be involved in the process. All sorts of people will have an interest in whether or not a particular school becomes self-governing, that is why we have provided, in clause 17(3), that when opting-out proposals have been published and submitted to the Secretary of State a period is allowed during which any person may submit representations to the Secretary of State as regards those proposals. I have no doubt many will take advantage of that provision when the occasion arises, with the Secretary of State getting representations from numerous individuals and organisations.<br><br>
A successful ballot is a pre-condition of a school moving to self-government but it is not the whole story; it is only one step in the process. However, the purpose of the ballot is not to test public opinion, nor is it decisive in determining whether a school will become self-governing. That decision will be taken by the Secretary of State in the light of all the circumstances. All that the ballot determines is whether an application for self-governing status is to be made and formal proposals submitted for the school.<br><br>
The Secretary of State must consider representations received on the proposals before taking his decision. The opinions of prospective
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 649</span>
pupils for the self-governing school are obviously relevant to the view that the Secretary of State must take on the likely long-term viability of the school. In such circumstances there is no danger that the opinion of those parents will be ignored, but it is neither necessary nor realistic to involve them in the ballot. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Western Isles to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 62 as it appears is an unnecessary elaboration of the general provision in clause 17(3) that any person—including an individual, a corporate body or an organisation—may make representations to the Secretary of State. I would certainly expect school boards or other schools in the area to be among those who would wish to comment on published proposals and they would be fully entitled to do so under the Bill as it stands. Indeed, where there are established close links between schools, those promoting proposals would probably be well advised to seek views from other schools at an early stage.<br><br>
It is certainly true that parents of prospective entrants to a school—I recognise the wording in the amendment—and of pupils at feeder primary schools are among those who have to be consulted on a range of changes affecting schools that an education authority may put forward at present, but there is an important distinction between involving some group in a wide-ranging consultative process and extending the right to vote in a ballot. When drawing up an electoral register of any sort, the clearest possible definitions are necessary. It is simply not possible to define precisely all those parents likely to have an interest in the school in one, two, or perhaps three years from now. It would leave far too much scope for dispute as to who was entitled to vote. For ballot purposes we must stick to the simplest and most intelligible concept—that is, the well-defined group of parents with children currently attending the school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must know that education authorities at present have a duty to consult a certain well-defined group of parents whose children may not attend a school that is being mooted for closure, but who could reasonably be expected to attend that school. If education authorities can have a duty to consult that defined group, why cannot they be brought into the scope of the ballot?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was listening when I said that I recognised the wording. I recognised it from the Education (Publication and Consultation Etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 1981, which are the basis of his amendment. I dealt with that point a few moments ago, and I said that it was certainly true that parents of prospective entrants to a school and of pupils at feeder primary schools are among those who have to be consulted on a range of changes affecting the school. I went on to explain that involving people in a consultation process is quite different from involving people in a ballot process where it is clearly important to be able to determine precisely who has a right to vote and who has not.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is saying that the rules that apply to school closures and matters of that sort,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 650</span>
should apply here, I agree with him. The same rules do apply because under clause 17(3), any person has a right to make representations and there is an effective consultative process. Amendment No. 62 shows that that is not widely understood, because the school boards would be within that category. They can make representations if they wish.<br><br>
Parents at feeder primaries to a secondary school may have an interest in the outcome of a ballot, but it is not certain that any of them will actually send their child to that secondary school: they have a choice, often a quite wide choice. If the geographical location is such that real choice is difficult or impossible, then of course the secondary school will be obliged to admit that child anyway, whether or not it is self-governing. The argument that some parents in such circumstances may not want to send their children to a self-governing school gets us nowhere: for each set of parents who want to send their child to a local authority school there may be parents who would prefer their child to go to a self-governing school.<br><br>
The next school commencement date will mean the start of the next school session, in the summer. Consider a ballot held in the autumn term: most ballots are likely to be held with a view to the school becoming self-governing in the coming summer. Parents will not yet have been asked to take decisions about choice of school for the following session, weighing up the alternatives on offer and deciding what is best for their child. The decision on whether a school is to become self-governing may have an important influence on the eventual decision about placing by some parents. In those circumstances, how could anyone decide which prospective parents should have a say in the ballot and which should not? The right could not be confined to parents living in a delineated catchment area; parental choice allows others to make application and enter the school. Among parents within the normal catchment area of a school, some may already have plans for their children to attend another school or know they will be moving out of the area before the next commencement date. What about parents who are certain that they wish their children to enter the school not in two years, but in three? Are they to be denied a say in the ballot while parents with no intention of sending their children to the school can take part? Extension of the franchise beyond those already at the school is not workable. Others can and should have their say but not through the ballot machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's statement about parents whose children may not end up going to the school could just as well apply to parents of children already at the school. After the ballot, those parents may move on and take their children elsewhere. There is no guarantee that a certain child will stay in the school after the ballot, even though his parents will have had a say in that vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The argument is not about the status of the parents and whether they are likely to move out of the area—it is about defining a precise constituency
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 651</span>
of people who have a right to vote. The fact that a parent at a school which is going for self-governing status may be about to move to another area does not present a difficulty when defining which parents should have a right to vote. Clearly, all parents with children at the school should be able to vote in the ballot.<br><br>
I was trying to show the absurdity and difficulties that could arise in practice in defining the electorate. Under the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Western Isles, parents intending to send their child to the school in three years' time would not have a vote, and parents who had no intention of sending their child to a school or were leaving the area would have a vote. Anomalies and difficulties would arise. Some people would be left out and that would cause controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same applies to the picture that the Minister paints. Parents whose child would be certain to go to the school in a year's time would have no vote, but parents whose child would be certain to leave the school in a year's time would have a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is still considering whether people have a right to be involved in the decision-making process. People whose children are about to go to the school can be involved in that process through consultation. However, the hon. Gentleman is not facing up to the difficulty of defining those people and running an election which would not be open to challenge or complaint because certain categories had been left out while others were included.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
It is not necessary to solve the difficulty. The ballot is not about taking the decision but about obtaining the views of the parents in the school. The decision is taken by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the basis of proposals that have come to him following a successful ballot result, and on the basis of the fact that various groups, including prospective parents and others, have made their representations to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is undermining his own argument. He emphasises the fact that the ballot will not be decisive but will merely be a tool to enable the Secretary of State to make an informed decision. That would seem to argue for including the wider constituency and against the importance of the precise boundary of the constituency, and against the practical problem to which he refers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. The purpose of the ballot is to obtain the views of those most directly affected, namely the parents in the school. There is not difficulty about running a ballot in those circumstances because the parents can easily be defined. The hon. Gentleman has not faced up to the difficulties of identifying who the prospective parents would be.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 652</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I have answered the hon. Gentleman's point. Who would draw up the electoral roll; how would we determine who would be entitled to be included? The hon. Gentleman has not faced up to the great practical difficulties involved. He tells me that certain people should be included without dealing with the practical difficulties and the inequity that would arise. That is unfair. Clearly there is a greater constituency of interest for those parents whose children are at the school at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that he greatly overstates the practical difficulties involved? The point that he has laboured would be an easy one for any director of education in Scotland to solve. Despite the parents' charter, few people exercise choice outwith the traditional catchment areas in an education authority such as Fife. The director of education in Fife could overcome the difficulty quickly, even if a difficulty arose. Perhaps the Minister would tell us more about the practical difficulties, as we have not heard any yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was here for all my remarks. That may be his difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a knockabout; it is a serious point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a serious point. When we have debates in Committee, it would be helpful if the Opposition Front Bench was occupied—if hon. Gentlemen listened to the arguments and did not come into the debate and ask me to go over ground again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is fine for a political knockabout. However, a serious point has been made in relation to practical difficulties thrown up by the Minister in response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). I merely seek a response which tells me more about the practical difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just gone over the practical difficulties at considerable length—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman says that he has heard them all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How would the hon. Gentleman overcome the problem of defining precisely all the parents in a given area who, in two years' time, will send their children to a school that is considering opting out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any knowledge of how education in Scotland works would lead anyone to a practical and satisfactory solution to overcome the enfranchisement of a wider community of interests. In Fife regional council education authority, very few parents exercise choice outwith the traditional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 653</span>
catchment area. From health board rolls, school population rolls and the fact that Fife has a nursery provision for all four-year-olds, it is easy to identify a group of parents with children who will go to a specific school. The vast majority would present no problem. Naturally, there could never be 100 per cent, efficiency, as there would always be some pupils who would move away and some parents who would exercise choice under the parental charter. But it is not the overwhelming difficulty that the Minister portrays.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill concerns self-governing schools in Scotland, not just in Fife or Strathclyde. The hon. Gentleman says that in Fife not many people make use of placing requests, but 10 per cent, of parents with children at primary 1 level and 13 per cent, with children at SI level do so. That is a significant proportion. We are talking about identifying potential pupils two years in advance, and requests being placed from outwith the catchment area, which I know of no way to identify.<br><br>
When I challenged the hon. Gentleman to say how it would work in practice, he said that, although it should be possible, he realised it would not be 100 per cent, efficient. I am sorry but, if decisions are to be made on the basis of ballots, it is important to determine the electoral roll and the criteria for eligibility to vote. There should be no dispute about that. To embark on an electoral process without doing that is to embark on something that will end in tears in the courts.<br><br>
It is irresponsible of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that the problem can be solved. Perhaps he can explain exactly how all the difficulties will be overcome, but he must not ask me to proceed on the basis of vague statements. We want a system that is workable, clearly defined, and on which there can be no dispute.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned Fife. The figure that I have for Scotland on placing requests at primary 1 level is 10 per cent. As a percentage of the primary school population in Fife, the figure is 12.4 per cent., so it is a somewhat greater problem in Fife than in Scotland as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making the proverbial meal out of this. We want some flexibility in widening the franchise. The figures for Fife concern 500 children out of 5,000 in primary 1. We are arguing on a point of democratic principle. Is the Minister elevating working difficulties to the extent that the principle cannot even be considered? The Minister should respond to that serious issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has either misunderstood the argument, or he is being extremely obtuse. If I were to suggest that local authority elections should be held without an electoral register—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How complete is it? People move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no dispute about entitlement to be on the electoral register, because criteria are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 654</span>
clearly defined. The hon. Gentleman says that people move; that is why we have rules about the time of year when people must register. We operate on that principle every year. The hon. Gentleman suggests that we can run a ballot without—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being pedantic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in this Committee to be pedantic. As we are making legislation, we must be certain that our proposals are workable and will not result in difficulties or disruption. The hon. Gentleman asks me to accept the amendments, but he has only the vaguest notion of how they would work. When I outline real, practical difficulties that would arise, he accuses me of being pedantic. I am pedantic in that I want the ballot procedure to be clearly defined.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman talks about democracy. We want people to have an opportunity to express their views and the procedure should enable parents of children in feeder primary schools and those who are thinking of sending their children to the school, and even those in the community who have no children, to express their views. They will be able to do so. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will take account of those views.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but the wording of his amendment is taken from the regulations that require a consultation process. We do not require a ballot. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to suggest that there should be a ballot on the procedure for school closures, involving those who might send their children to the school in future and those with children at the local feeder primary schools. Of course, the hon Gentleman would not like to do that. He would argue that the existing regulations, which require consultation, do not involve the difficulties of defining who should vote. But he is making precisely that suggestion for this procedure. That is absurd and ridiculous. The hon. Gentleman must deal with the difficulties and not dismiss them as ministerial pedanticism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is interested in whether the electorate can be defined precisely. Amendment No. 26 suggests that feeder primary schools be included in the ballot procedure. It is easy to define the electorate precisely for feeder primaries, which are well known by reference to the education authority catchment area and to the registered pupils at those schools. That electorate can be defined precisely. All feeder primaries and all parents of children at those schools could be involved in the balloting procedures. It is not that that cannot be done—the Minister does not want to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that pupils come from different schools to feeder primaries and the problem of definition lies more, as I said to the hon. Member for Fife, Central, with the prospective parents.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has corrected me on one point. I said that I was being accused of pedanticism, but I should have said

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 655</span>
pedantry. That shows the need for greater emphasis on grammar in our education system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister would have failed the test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet received my right hon. and learned Friend's entry for the test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I still think that the Minister is confusing the need for a precise constituency with the thought that every individual in that precise constituency would send their children to that particular school. I do not understand the difficulty of defining a precise constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) suggested that that would be the parents of children in the last two years at feeder primaries. All the children may not go to a relevant school, but the same is true of all the children at the relevant school— they may not stay there. The Minister is confusing the problem of defining the constituency with the problem of ensuring that all the children go to the school. There are bound to be iniquities, just as there would be even if an electoral boundary were drawn round the school itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. Regrettably, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) is not here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be speaking to amendment No. 175 later in the debate on behalf of the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not appreciate that the hon. Lady would do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an alliance.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is more successful than the previous one in which the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber was involved. I am grateful to the hon. Lady, as the amendment recognises the difficulty with the definition of feeder primaries, which the hon. Member for Western Isles does not seem to appreciate, and which the hon. Member for Dundee, East certainly does not appreciate. It attempts to define those schools. There are difficulties in defining a feeder primary, as we cannot say with certainty whether parents would choose to send their children to such schools. They might prefer to send their children to other schools. The amendment of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber is an attempt to define the categories of school that would be included in the provision.<br><br>
There is also no certainty whether parents will wish to send their children to a school which is considering self-governing status. Their views might be affected by whether a school achieves it. There are great practical difficulties, and it is not necessary for us to embark on such a complicated and difficult
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 656</span>
procedure. After all, we can obtain the views about a proposal from the feeder primaries and other groups through the consultation process under the 1981 regulations that has worked effectively in relation to matters such as site changes and closures. I regret that I am unable to help the Committee.<br><br>
It might be possible to take on board the thinking behind amendment No. 62. However, it is not necessary to do so as it is already provided for. We would just be adding a redundant provision to the Bill. If the Committee considers that it would be helpful if I explained that, I am prepared to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to the Committee if I made an announcement. I have accepted a manuscript amendment that is almost identical to amendment No. 108. It is not my practice to accept manuscript amendments but, in this case, it would benefit the entire Committee. Copies of the amendment are on both tables in the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify the alliance to which I referred? I shall speak to amendment No. 175, which has been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnson). The Minister will have noted that several amendments have been tabled by the hon. Gentleman and I. Perhaps that is because we have adjoining constituencies and, although we represent different parties, we share similar interests.<br><br>
Amendment No. 175 has been tabled because of the implications of the Bill for rural constituencies. The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) said earlier that it was in the spirit of the amendments tabled by Labour hon. Members. In response to the hon. Gentleman, the Minister referred specifically to the implications of the parents' charter in urban areas. It would be interesting to see how rural areas will be affected. As the Minister admitted in reply to the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) in an earlier debate, there are instances when feeder schools and secondary schools are almost one and the same, so an element of protection must be built in for those schools. Those links are close in our rural communities, and teachers from secondary schools often visit the primary schools and vice versa. The number of children who do not attend the local secondary school is very small. It would be interesting if the Minister had statistics on that.<br><br>
We believe that it is important to define the exact relationship between the feeder primary schools and secondary schools. Over 50 per cent, of the pupils leaving the feeder school during the past three years went on to the school about which the ballot will be held. That shows a clear interest in the feeder schools about what will happen to the secondary school. It is wrong that the parents of a child in the final year of secondary school should decide the future of that school while the opinions of parents of future pupils would be excluded.<br><br>
I recognise that there may be technical difficulties with the amendment. The Minister has said that he appreciates the relationship that is described in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 657</span>
amendment No. 175 and I wonder whether we can consider that in the context of rural communities and with an overall view in Scotland. The vast majority of children still tend to move on to the immediate neighbourhood secondary school. It is a small number who exercise the parents' charter, so I want to ensure that there is a clear link between the feeder and secondary schools in the area.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will not dismiss my remarks completely but will respond positively to see whether we can examine further the ability to define how the parents of children attending feeder primary schools could participate in deciding the future of their neighbourhood secondary school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on an interesting development that took place yesterday. In Tuesday's amendment paper, amendment No. 87, tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was printed. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Schedule 3, page 53, line 40, after 'school', insert 'and the parents of any child due to attend the school by the next school commencement date'".</p></blockquote>
It seems that our anxiety about widening the franchise was shared by the hon. Member for Eastwood but, alas, the amendment was withdrawn from the amendment paper, hence the blank space after amendment No. 26. Would the Minister suggest the hon. Member for Eastwood was as confused as he thought we were about defining a natural constituency for ballotting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am moving off that point, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman is moving off that point and I hope that the matter of withdrawing an amendment is not belaboured by any other member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue at stake is one of widening the franchise. The Minister's response again is to say that there are technical difficulties and that we must have a precise constituency or group to participate in the ballot. He is right to make the distinction between a ballot that would accept the need for self-governing status, and the consultation that would take place after proposals had been debated in the wider community.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the technical problems and working difficulties, but we want him to agree that there is a need to examine feeder primary schools. Despite the parents' charter, we should examine the matter within the context of a substantial group of children who will move on to a specific and defined school. That is widespread throughout Scotland, although the Minister is right to say that the parental charter is sometimes involved and choice is exercised. The prescription could be upset by children in a feeder primary school who move before they enter the comprehensive that wants to opt out. If a case can be made for extending the franchise, some consideration should be given to the practical aspects
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
of defining that procedure, which we could then discuss at a later date.<br><br>
I stress that many organisations in Scotland consider this a reasonable request. For a comprehensive school to opt out requires a major decision in the education authority sector. Surely it would be right and just for parents of children in that school to decide in the ballot, besides having an opportunity to contribute to the consultation process in the community-wide debate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles pointed out that parents of children in the last two years of a comprehensive school will be allowed to participate in a decision that will not affect their children, because they will have left the school by the time that the Secretary of State grants self-governing status. That could happen at the same time as the parents of children about to enter the school were denied the right to decide in a ballot whether that would be their preferred choice for that comprehensive school. That seems a reasonable principle in view of the anomalies and inconsistencies that Opposition Members and other organisations in Scotland see in concentrating the franchise on parents of children in the school at a particular time.<br><br>
I do not want to delay the Committee by rehearsing some of the arguments put by my hon. Friends on the importance of the decision that is ultimately taken when a school opts for self-governing status. If the Minister believes in the principled position that he advocates, the widest base of parental support would surely be a help in determining whether a comprehensive school had the broad-based agreement of its feeder primaries and the parents and pupils in that immediate catchment area.<br><br>
Setting aside the practical difficulties that the Minister foresees, we are disappointed that there is no flexibility or concession on the essential principle of extending the franchise to parents and pupils who have a legitimate right to exercise that franchise and to contribute to what will be, in many communities, an important decision. They will have to be bystanders and will be excluded from the vote. That is regrettable. Can the Minister say whether there will be any flexibility on those provisions? I hope that there is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, hope that the Minister will have a change of heart and will yet decide to reconsider the matter to try to establish whether there is a way to involve feeder primaries in the balloting procedure for comprehensive schools.<br><br>
The Minister stated clearly that the ballot procedure is not decisive but is only a means to find out the parents' views. The decision will remain with the Secretary of State for Scotland who may, or may not, accept the parents' view. That runs counter to the argument of Conservative Members. They claimed that the Bill would be a major extension of democracy and would return power to the parents. Now the Minister says that it is nothing of the kind, but that it is just a means of finding out what parents think about the principle of self-governing status. The power will remain with the Secretary of State for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 659</span>
Scotland regardless of the result of the ballot. He can decide whether he wishes to accept it.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
I was saddened to hear the Minister's remarks, but they confirmed the significant trend away from democracy in Scotland over the past 10 years. The Government have treated the general election result as a means of discovering the views of the Scottish people, but the Government have completely ignored them. Three out of four people in Scotland voted against the poll tax, yet it is enacted there a year before anywhere else. The Government and the Minister do not believe in democracy.<br><br>
I was interested in the Minister's view that the problem with including feeder primaries is defining which schools they are. He cited the parents' charter. In Dundee, parents can use the parents' charter to send their children to whatever school they wish. Unless there is an overwhelming reason against it, the child has the right to go there. However, that does not mean that parents would expect to be involved in the ballot for every single school in Dundee that might want to opt out. People accept that, although they have rights under the parents' charter, they are not entitled to the same ones as those parents who are directly involved with a school.<br><br>
Parents would accept it as fair that the ballot should not involve just a secondary school. The feeder primaries that have always been identified with it should also be considered. Close links between the schools have been encouraged by education authorities and the Scottish Education Department. It is commonplace for primary 6 and primary 7 pupils to visit the secondary school on a regular basis and for secondary school teachers to go to the feeder primaries to familiarise the children with the type of education that they will later receive. That gives the different types of schools the sense of belonging to one community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recollect that we made the point to the Minister on the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 that he should recognise the cohesion and community spirit between primary and secondary schools? I believe that he said that he would consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's memory is better than mine. I do not recall what the Minister said, but he or his civil servants could check the transcripts of the debates and confirm that it was said that the cohesive principle between primary feeders and the parent secondary school was important and that it should not be disrupted. The Minister is now dividing the schools by excluding feeder primaries from the balloting procedures even though they have an interest in them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My memory is better than that of the hon. Members for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) or for Dundee, East. We discussed these matters and I confirmed that the provisions of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 did not prevent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
school boards from coming together to set up umbrella organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for reminding us of what happened. The principle is established that there is a clear relationship between the parent school and the feeder primaries. That is what we have argued on this amendment, but the Minister has taken no cognisance of that. In fact, the trend in education is to speak of junior schools, senior schools and middle-range schools, which stretch from primary 6 to secondary 2. Those four years are critical and should be seen as a continuous educational process.<br><br>
That strengthens the view that feeder primaries are closely interwoven with the parent secondary school. It seems as though the Minister wants to destroy that link because he has suggested that in the balloting procedure self-governing schools can go their own way irrespective of the views of the feeder primaries. The majority view of every feeder primary could be that a secondary school should remain under education authority control, but if a minority of people at the secondary school used the ballot to deliver a simple majority of votes cast, the Secretary of State for Scotland would regard that as sufficient evidence for the school to go its own way.<br><br>
The Minister said that every feeder primary would be involved in the consultation process, but how? Will the head teacher and staff be consulted or just the school board? Will every parent at every feeder primary attached to a secondary school be consulted? If so, the Minister cannot argue that it would be impossible to give every parent a vote on the proposal for self-governing status. If all parents at the feeder primary are to be written to, they can also be sent a ballot paper in the post.<br><br>
Amendment No. 26 would not include all parents but only those with children in primary 6 and 7, so it would not involve much extra expenditure or administration. It is within the Minister's competence to ensure that amendment No. 26 is carried and that the franchise is widened. He has decided not to accept it because parents who might have the right through the parents' charter to come from other areas of a city to a secondary school would not be able to vote.<br><br>
I do not accept the Minister's argument that defining the precise constituency is too difficult. He could easily widen the franchise but he says that he does not want to do so because anomalies would occur. My hon. Friends have already pointed out that there are anomalies in the balloting procedure at present, so that argument does not stand up either. Winston Churchill said:
<br><blockquote><p>"democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried".</p></blockquote>
Democracy will cause problems for the Minister, his civil servants and the staff of self-governing schools but that is an insufficient argument for not widening the franchise.<br><br>
There are three Catholic secondary schools in Dundee—St Johns and Lawside academy, which are in the west of the city, and St Saviours high school which is in the east of the city in Whitfield. Although
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0379">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
it is unlikely, let us suppose that St Saviours decided to opt out and the vote was carried. That would mean that Catholic parents in the eastern part of the city could no longer send their children to a Catholic school that was under education authority control and reasonably close to home. They would have to send them to the other end of the city to St Johns or Lawside academy, which would involve long journeys, extra expenditure and risks in crossing roads and so on.<br><br>
The Minister is determined to break up the concept of the neighbourhood school with local feeder primaries, which is particularly important in Dundee. In Broughty Ferry, which is not an area renowned for voting Labour, there is no Catholic primary school. This legislation could also leave them without a Catholic secondary school if they wanted one under education authority control. That is the practical consequence of the Minister's wish to get the result that he wants.<br><br>
The Minister knows that he can widen the franchise. He thinks that if he does widen it he will not get the results that he wants to allow the Secretary of State to permit schools to opt out. The Gainsborough question, as the Minister calls it, has arisen many times: how many schools will opt out? The Minister and the Secretary of State will do all in their power to ensure that the maximum number of schools opt out. The Government are resisting the amendment because it would make their job a little more difficult, but not because there are any practical problems. They will not accept it because it does not suit their purpose of breaking up the education authorities and the Scottish comprehensive system of education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has repeated with tedium "Trust the parents", but that means "Trust the Secretary of State" because he will decide matters. The Bill is nothing more than a fix, because the overwhelmingly democratic argument is in favour of extending the franchise to primary schools. What about parents who have children in S6? If the ballot takes place in March, one month and six weeks later those children will have left school because of the O-grades and Highers coming on. But the parents of those children have the opportunity to decide the future of that school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall the hon. Gentleman arguing in relation to the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 that those parents should not have a right to a vote for the election of the school boards. How does he square his argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) said, let us concentrate on the difficulties here; let us not have a sideshow on another issue.<br><br>
Parents will have a say but will have no material interest in the school from August onwards. That is undemocratic. Let us contrast that with the position of parents in primary schools, and the trend that has developed over the years for primary and secondary schools to co-operate closely. Feeder schools have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
been encouraged by the Government and education authorities to identify with the local secondary school. Schools are to be seen as an educational family to which secondary and primary school teachers and parents of children at those schools belong.<br><br>
The arrangements between secondary and primary schools have been well established, especially in Strathclyde, over the past 10 years. I speak from experience. For several years I was assistant head teacher charged with fostering relationships between primary and secondary schools. Those relationships did not simply start in February or March before the admission date in August and then finish; they continued after August. In November I met children in primary schools in their classes and discussed the curriculum with primary 6 and 7 teachers to see what level they had reached in English and mathematics.<br><br>
We gained an idea of the standards of all the feeder primary schools which enabled us to plan our S1 and S2 curriculum in English, maths and other subjects. At the turn of the year—in February or March—we invited primary school children to the Secondary school and we returned to the primary schools to meet their parents. That was five or six months before the official admission date. An educational and social link was established between parents and staff.<br><br>
The year before their children went to the secondary school of their choice, parents were identifying with that school. However, if the Minister does not accept the amendment, he will disfranchise and disillusion several parents of primary school children, because uppermost in their minds is how their children will adapt to secondary schools. That has never been an easy transition. Staff talk to those parents to ease that transition. So there is identification and commonality between the primary and secondary school. In that case, there is an overwhelming democratic argument for accepting the proposal.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
Secondary schools have to plan right up to when the children come in in August, whether that means children coming from primary school—primary 7 to SI—or children leaving at S5 and possibly coming back the next week. If we ask that of every secondary school in the area, surely it is not beyond our wit to devise a planning system whereby we know the parents whose children will be going to the school from primary 7 to S1.<br><br>
I am in favour of all the amendments, but I commend amendment No. 175 in particular. I agree with the Minister that it makes things a little easier if the definition of parents includes
<br><blockquote><p>"parents at primary schools at which over 50 per cent, of the pupils leaving over the last three years went on to the school about which the ballot is being held."</p></blockquote>
If the Minister can overcome the obstacles, as he has in the past, in the name of democracy and decency, he will be showing Opposition Members, for once in this committee, that he is a decent Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on this group of amendments, but the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) quite properly mentioned the Roman Catholic schools in Dundee. Therefore, it is reasonable for me to mention the Roman Catholic secondary and primary schools affected in my constituency.<br><br>
It would be difficult to arrive at the 50 per cent, figure for one Roman Catholic primary school, where frequently more than 50 per cent, of the children leaving to go to secondary school have not gone to the designated Roman Catholic secondary school. They have gone instead to the local school, which is not Roman Catholic, because of the limitation on the number of such schools. That is a major flaw. We talk about the situation in the city, but the situation in country areas is quite different. There is no easy access in country areas. I know of one school in Perth, which is a long way from the country school. The country schoolchildren often go to the local secondary school, rather than going into Perth. The hon. Member for Dundee, East should realise that there are problems on both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is trying to be helpful, but amendment No. 175 does not require the secondary school to be the designated secondary school if it is a Catholic secondary school. The amendment simply refers to the schools to which people have transferred over the past three years. If 50 per cent, or more pupils in one of the primary schools went to a different school from the one that they would have been expected to go to, that would not matter, because it would still be the school to which that number of pupils actually went. Therefore, that objection does not stand up.<br><br>
The Minister's arguments are based largely on accuracy and the need for a ballot to be exact so that everyone eligible to vote has a vote. He expressed great doubts about how that could be achieved. Will he enlighten us a bit more, because I cannot understand what his problem is? It is well known which schools are the feeder primary schools for every secondary school in an area. If there is any doubt about the relevant feeder primary schools to Scottish secondary schools, the Minister can doubtless get the information from the Scottish Education Department or the relevant education authorities. Any doubts could be clarified to carry out the requirement of the amendment.<br><br>
Which is the greater good, to leave things as they are in the Bill and therefore disfranchise parents who have a serious interest in the outcome of the Bill or, where there is doubt—and there can be few such cases in Scotland—simply to give them no say at all? If there are any such schools, perhaps the Minister's officials can tell him exactly where they are and what the difficulty is. As that seems to be the only substantial argument against the amendment, I cannot understand why it is so difficult to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady might be able to help. My memory may be deficient, but I am sure that she will know and can comment upon the position of a primary school such as St Agnes and a secondary such as John Paul school in Glasgow.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister asked that. Pupils at St Agnes who wish to go to John Paul school are presently in difficulty because they are zoned, if I recall correctly, for St Augustine's. That is an example of a primary school where pupils cannot go to the secondary school that is close to their home. The Minister has allowed other primary schools further away than St Agnes to be designated for John Paul school The Minister is introducing a red herring because our point is simply that whichever schools send 50 per cent, or more of their pupils to a relevant secondary school should be eligible to vote. However, I am glad that the Minister raised the point. It is unfair for the parents of children at St Agnes to have to send their children further away to another school, with traffic hazards and all the rest.<br><br>
I should like to see more careful zoning of schools and I should like that responsibility to be looked at both by the Scottish Education Department and by the relevant regional councils. Odd zoning arrangements are not good for either the pupils or the parents. My hon. Friends might be interested to learn that one of the reasons why St Agnes parents are in difficulty is that parents from Bearsden over the Glasgow border are sending their children to this Glasgow secondary school. I do not object to that, but it seems a bit unreasonable that Maryhill children who live just down the road from John Paul school cannot go to it. The Minister's intervention does not answer the case because we are talking about the reality, not what people might like the reality to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several points have been made. Perhaps I can point out to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) that rezoning is usually the responsibility of the regional council. The point about St Agnes is that parents are more interested in the future of John Paul school than of St Augustine's to which they are zoned. The hon. Lady described it as a red herring, but the fact that I was trying to tease out of her is that there are feeder primaries, such as the case in Glasgow that she knows about, where most of the children go to schools other than the designated school, perhaps because they are nearer.<br><br>
The hon. Lady has moved on from supporting the amendment that was moved by the hon. Member for Western Isles to the amendment to which the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) spoke, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber. She was moving slightly out of her delineated zone. I do not criticise her for that. I said that, of all the amendments, that at least acknowledged the difficulties of definition. It does not overcome those difficulties, but that is another matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Moray was particularly concerned about rural areas. I acknowledge that the difficulties there are less, but they are still real. However, there are matters of principle regarding the electorate. The hon. Member for Dumbarton said that the whole thing was a sham. It appears that we have reached the stage where it has dawned on the hon. Gentleman that the ballot is not about taking the decision; it is about initiating the process. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 665</span>
decision is taken by the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman said that that was the antithesis of democracy. On the contrary. The Secretary of State takes the decision about whether the school should be allowed to become self-governing. Once the school is self-governing, the board of management is free to run the school in the way that is considers to be appropriate within certain safeguards. It is where things go wrong that, in the main, the powers of my right hon. and learned Friend are used.<br><br>
I have discussed all the arguments about the difficulty of defining the electorate. It is rather curious that the hon. Member for Moray should argue that it is appropriate for decisions on whether the school should go for self-governing status to be taken by a broader electorate—which we have already agreed is difficult to define—whereas the board of management should be elected by the parents at the school. Why should it be right for the board of management to be elected by a constituency that consists of parents at the school, including those whose children are about to leave or have just arrived at the school, but not appropriate that they should be part of the electorate in a ballot that decides whether they should try to persuade the Secretary of State that they should have a board of management? There is a contradiction there that was not resolved by any of the Opposition Members who have spoken in support of the amendments.<br><br>
I refute the notion that the measure is antidemocratic. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the proposals are viable and command the support of the wider community. What the hon. Member for Dumbarton described as antidemocratic is the very process whereby parents in rural schools and feeder primary schools, the local authority and all others with a legitimate interest may have their say and express a view.<br><br>
If Opposition Members want ballots, there is nothing to stop the school board in a feeder primary school, if it was so inclined, running its own plebiscite to get a view before it made its representations to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who would pay for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The school board has a duty to promote contact with the parents and obtain information and advice from them. In that context, I have no doubt that it could invite the parents to express their views in whatever way it considers to be appropriate. In making representations to the Secretary of State, a school board would want to be satisfied that it was aware of the overall opinions within the school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that such a ballot by a feeder primary school should be conducted within the one-month period that is defined under clause 17(3)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady is arguing that the one-month period is too short a period for making representations and for other such matters, there may be an opportunity for her to discuss that later. If she is saying that the Government are not giving
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
sufficient time for the consultation process on which we believe everything depends, she may find me more sympathetic to that view than to the arguments that she gallantly put forward on behalf of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston), which pose substantial practical problems.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that it is not democratic for the Secretary of State to decide whether a ballot is valid. Will the Minister comment on that?<br><br>
If feeder schools held a ballot, would it be legitimate for them to pay for it from their budget or would they be entitled to money from either the education authority or the Scottish Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They would not be eligible for additional funding. Unless I am advised to the contrary, my interpretation of the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988—which the hon. Gentleman and I saw pass through Committee more speedily than this Bill—is that school boards have a clear duty to establish proper links and communications with parents and to ascertain their views on various issues. Therefore, I envisage no problem. Section 12(2)(b) of that Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every School Board shall—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>… as often as appears to them to be necessary, ascertain the views of parents on matters which are the responsibility of the Board."</p></blockquote>
The board of a primary feeder to a secondary school would have the responsibility to respond to the consultation process and could use the budget provided for that purpose. That is not to say that an expressed view would be a decision-taking ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not democratic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to clear his mind of the fog that is debilitating his usually effective thinking process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I object. The Minister has praised me twice in the one day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that I was praising the hon. Gentleman on this occasion. He has difficulty understanding the purpose of the ballot. It is to ascertain whether the school is able to put proposals to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State decides whether the proposals represent the interests of the school and are soundly based. He must take various matters into account. The ballot is the test of parental opinion inside the school.<br><br>
If neighbouring school boards wanted to make representations and ascertain the views of parents because they felt that it was part of their responsibility, they could do so. That should satisfy hon. Members even if they are not wholly convinced of our ability to solve the problems. I confess that, having considered the matter sympathetically, I do not believe that it is possible to overcome the problems without it resulting in dispute, argument and discontent, and that is the last thing that we want to happen.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will a school board wishing to hold a ballot of parents on the fate of the secondary school for which it is a feeder primary be able to approach the education authority for financial assistance for that purpose? It may run into financial difficulties if it is one of those secondary schools having successive annual ballots. Would it be permissible for such a school board to approach the local education authority for financial assistance to hold such a ballot?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always permissible to approach an education authority about any matter of interest to the school board. It can make representations to the authority. Section 17(3) of the School Boards (Scotland) 1988 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If, during any financial year, it appears to an education authority appropriate to do so, they may make monies in addition to those allocated under this section available to a School Board for the purposes described in subsection (1) above"—</p></blockquote>
which is—
<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall, in respect of each financial year, and before the beginning of that financial year, determine for each School Board in the authority's area allocations of such monies within the authority's budget as appear to the education authority, after consultation with the Board, to be reasonably required by the Board for—(a) meeting administrative expenses, the expenses of training of members of the Board, and other outgoings; and (b) carrying out any functions delegated to the Board under this Act."</p></blockquote>
From that I would deduce that the answer is "yes".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not the two provisions that the Minister has read out leave the decision-making with the education authority? It is for the authority to decide whether it would be reasonable for the school boards to carry out a ballot, not for the school board, the Minister or the parents. Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not right. It would be for the authority to decide whether it would make extra money available if there were a shortage. However, I would not have thought that there would be a problem in this respect.<br><br>
This has been a helpful debate, as it has explored the ability of school boards to consult on the matter. On that basis, Committee members should feel happy if the amendments are withdrawn. Many will no doubt see another reason why school boards are one of the Government's good innovations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be withdrawing amendment No. 62.1 accept the Minister's assurance that its provisions are already contained in the Bill.<br><br>
I find the Minister's final remarks fascinating. He seemed to give us precisely what we hoped for, which was for the school boards of feeder primaries to conduct ballots and for those to be financially assisted through the education authority, if it felt concerned that such parents should also be consulted about the decision of a particular secondary school to become self-governing, or to change its characteristics. I presume that the same provision would apply to a ballot being required by a self-governing school on whether one of its major characteristics should be altered and it should become a school characterised by selection according to general academic ability. I see no distinction between those two kinds of ballots.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 668</span>
The Minister has already said that a ballot held in a school being considered for self-governing status would be not a decisive ballot but a tool of consultation. Therefore, a ballot held at a feeder primary would have the same status. Our aim in the amendment was so parents of children in feeder primaries would be consulted directly by ballot about the fate of secondary school the status of which was being reconsidered. The Minister has opened this fascinating vista before us and smoothed the path, not administratively but financially, having said that education authorities have the ability to finance ballots. I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) but I feel inclined to withdraw the amendment and return to the topic on Report.<br><br>
Parents of pupils in feeder primary schools will be interested to read the report of today's proceedings and to see that they can have their views recorded by means of a ballot and submitted to the Secretary of State at the same time as he receives the balloted views of a school choosing to opt out. The Secretary of State can then examine the results of all the ballots jointly. As the Minister said, the ballots are tools of consultation, and the Secretary of State must take into account those parents' views. Therefore, one would expect the ballots to have an equivalent status when the Secretary of State makes a decision.<br><br>
I am delighted that this long debate is now taking a direction that we did not anticipate even half way through it. In that positive spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 106, in schedule 3, page 53, line 35, after "such", insert "independent".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 107, in schedule 3, page 53, line 37, after "guidance", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"prepared in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.".</p></blockquote>
No. 190, in schedule 3, page 54, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"7. The education authority shall not take any action to influence the outcome of the ballot.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should say at the outset that I am discussing amendments Nos. 106 and 107, and not 190, with which I do not agree.<br><br>
The amendments deal with the first two paragraphs of schedule 3, the first of which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The school board shall secure that all necessary arrangements for the ballot are made by such body as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
As prescription is in the hands of the Secretary of State for Scotland, we seek to insert the word "independent" before "body". Anyone interested in Scottish politics knows that when the Secretary of State is given powers in education, in reality they are given to the Minister responsible for education, who at the moment is the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth). Given his record and that of the Secretary of State, in dealing with independent bodies, the bodies prescribed by the Minister must be independent.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0383">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
The Government's record shows that they are not keen on dealing with independent bodies or individuals. One has only to look at the health board appointments that have been made in Scotland over the past 10 years since the Conservatives came to office to see how the Minister has been instrumental in ensuring that any independent voice that spoke out against Government policy or opposed what the Minister through was not re-appointed to the health boards. Appointed in the place of those independent voices were voices that would simply echo whatever the Minister wanted said about the health boards.<br><br>
The same is true about the appointments to colleges. In a recent famous case, Mr. Bill Speir was not re-appointed to a certain college in Scotland because he was too independent of the Government. Everyone else on the board of technology was delighted with his performance as a governor and nominated him for re-appointment, but the Minister intervened and said that he did not want people who were not only opposed to the Government, but who were effectively opposed to them. Mr. Speir's crime was that he opposed effectively what the Government tried to do in education.<br><br>
Given the Government's track record of not being interested in allowing people to express their views on health, education and other matters of interest to Scottish people, it is essential to define as independent the body that will lay down the electoral arrangements for the ballot. Otherwise, the Minister might recommend that, for example, the Adam Smith Institute would prescribe the election arrangements.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
Our objection would be not only to the Right-wing nature of that body, but to its incompetence. I understand that it has an index in the Library that puts me at the bottom of the league for defending freedom. Everyone knows that I am a great defender of freedom, especially as it applies to all Scottish people and not just to the narrow elite in which the Adam Smith Institute and the Minister are interested. Unless the committee accepts an amendment to the Bill at this stage, the Minister will have wide powers to appoint whomever he prefers—the Adam Smith Institute of the Freedom Association.<br><br>
The Minister said that he intends to appoint the Electoral Reform Society. We should have no objections to that body making the electoral arrangements. When I first heard about it, I thought that it was a body in favour of proportional representation. That put it in a good light. The Electoral Reform Society is respected by everyone from all sides of the political argument in Scotland. I understand that the Social and Liberal Democrats used it to resolve the internal wrangling in the alliance between the Social Democratic party and the Liberals.<br><br>
It would be acceptable to public opinion in Scotland to have the Electoral Reform Society as the body making the electoral arrangements. Therefore, the Minister should have not problem accepting amendment No. 106 as the Electoral Reform Society is an independent body. If the Minister resists the amendment, we should have to interpret what he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
told us earlier as mere Jackanories and conclude that he has no intention of appointing the Electoral Reform Society, but has more questionable ideas which he does not want to reveal at this stage. I expect him to accept amendment No. 106, and I shall be surprised if he does not.<br><br>
Amendment No. 107 deals with paragraph 2, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The arrangements shall accord with such guidance as the Secretary of State may from time to time publish for the purposes of this Schedule."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 107 would insert after "guidance":
<br><blockquote><p>"prepared in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities."</p></blockquote>
The amendment's purpose is to ascertain the form and content of the Secretary of State's guidance and to ensure that that guidance is the subject of consultation with COSLA. The form and content given to the Electoral Reform Society—if that is the body chosen—is very important.<br><br>
Under schedule 3, the ballot paper requires parents to answer "yes" or "no" to whether they agree with the proposal for self-governing status. The ballot paper could be framed in a pejorative way. Let me take the example of Tayside. The hon. Member for Tayside, North is also keen to use Tayside as an example. In Tayside, the ballot paper might ask parents to answer "yes" or "no" to whether they wish to have self-governing status in Pitlochry or whether they prefer to remain under the dominion of the education authority in Dundee. That is an unfair question. Most people in Pitlochry would answer "yes" to the self-governing status in those circumstances. The wording of the ballot paper is important. Its form is important also.<br><br>
A recent publication from Scottish Homes—the new national housing agency in Scotland—that was sent to tenants had a blue and white cover and contained many question marks and exclamation marks, which made it difficult to read. Most tenants would find it almost indecipherable. It is necessary to have a clearly laid out ballot paper with a simple and fair question. The Electoral Reform Society will be receiving such guidance from the Secretary of State for Scotland, so we must know exactly what are the Minister's intentions in that respect.<br><br>
What sort of information will be made available to parents? That is germane to what guidance the Secretary of State for Scotland will lay down for the prescribed body. For example, if it were intended to provide in that information anything that refers to the education authority or the provisions it makes for education, it will be necessary to check that it is not only accurate but fair. That is why it is essential that COSLA is involved and agrees with the Minister on the sort of information that will be made available.<br><br>
It is important that, included in the information, are the rights of parents under not only the Bill, but the parents' charter and other educational legislation. Parents can then compare what the position of schools would be under self-governing status with what it is under the control of the local education authority. The Minister must consult COSLA about those important matters before he issues guidance to the prescribed organisation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0384">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
Various other questions must be answered too. I understand that information about the school will be provided. A board of management or the school board might present information pejoratively, which would put the position of the school under education authority control in a poor light. It would be unfair if that happened. Therefore, it is important that COSLA agrees on the guidance that will be issued to decide the scope of a board of management or school board. Restrictions must be imposed on those bodies to insist on their providing fair and accurate information.<br><br>
Similarly, information will be made available about the electoral arrangements. It is important that there is consultation, so that people know where, and how the votes will be counted, and how the result will be relayed to parents. People must have confidence in the result of the ballot. It must not only be fair, but seen to be fair. If the Minister wishes to gain the acceptance, not only by parents but by local authorities and the entire community of such decisions it is essential that he involves representatives of the education authorities in the consultation process. He must ensure that the information is good guidance, and that it establishes good practice under which the balloting of parents is undertaken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to amendment No. 190, which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). I tabled it because I am worried about what could happen if a local authority decided—with all the muscle and power that it has—to try to frustrate the outcome of a ballot. A local authority should not attempt unduly to influence parents by issuing misinformation. It could be argued that local authorities would not do that, but recent experience of what happened with the community charge has left me with little confidence that local authorities in Scotland will publish accurate information. I can provide endless evidence to the Committee of inaccurate information being issued about the community charge but you, Mr. Martin, would rule me out of order if I did so.<br><br>
I hope that it is in order for me to cite examples of the information that has been issued about ballots in England. Before tabling the amendment and before 4.30 this afternoon, I had never met anyone from the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust, nor had I read correspondence from it. As a result of tabling the amendment, the trust kindly supplied information about what had happened in England. Five examples will show that the distribution of misinformation about ballots for schools wishing to opt out is fairly widespread.<br><br>
The examples that I shall cite were in Derbyshire, Rochdale, Tameside, Brent and Liverpool, involving Chesterfield school, Queen Elizabeth school, Middleton, Siddal Moor school, Heywood, Audenshaw school, Claremont school and St. Frances Xavier school.<br><br>
I tabled my amendment because I felt strongly about the matter in the light of my experience over
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
the community charge. We know that the name of the community charge was changed with no legal entitlement to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman, knowing his considerable interest in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could be accused of many things, but not of a lack of interest in the poll tax. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that Mr. Speaker ruled in order questions to Ministers about the poll tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Speaker has given exactly and clearly the legal position. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to that because I asked Mr. Speaker about it following the point made about the legality of tabling those questions under the rules of the House. Mr. Speaker gave a definitive statement on that. If the hon. Gentleman has not read it, I recommend that he does so. I shall be ruled out of order if I continue along that route.<br><br>
It has been interesting to see the letters, leaflets, press releases and the advertisements that contain misleading information. Local authorities have granted money to those who are opposed to opting out and in so doing have given us cause for concern. I remember my hon. Friend the Minister suggesting earlier that my amendment was tougher than he would expect. That is me running true to form. I was a little worried when he said before that I had not been tough enough. It is encouraging to know that this amendment has me running true to form. I hope that when he hears the examples that I shall give, he will believe that my amendment, though perhaps defective in its wording, has a content and intent that must be implemented in the Bill.<br><br>
I shall list the items and show where there is misinformation. I hope that the Committee will bear with me, as it is an important fundamental matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that it was wrong for a local authority to give money to those who oppose the concept of opted out schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not opposed to both sides of the argument being made. It is essential for individuals who are deciding the future of children and their schools that they have facts on which to base their judgment. I am arguing about misinformation that could be called downright lies.<br><br>
I have hard evidence to support my remarks, thanks to the Grant-Maintained Schools Trust, which kindly gave me the evidence this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the wording of his amendment might be deficient. Given that he is worried about misinformation from whatever quarter, does he accept that one of the deficiencies of his amendment is that it does not encompass the Secretary of State? Surely the spirit of the amendment applies equally to education authorities and to the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0385">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 673</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is asking me to suggest that any Secretary of State, of whatever political complexion, will give misinformation on specific single issues as it affects one school, I should be astonished and I am not being frivolous. If we put forward views on principles, we may go over the top to ensure that we get the point across, but when we get into detail on specific schools and situations, we must examine the argument to ensure that it is factually correct. I am not arguing that one side should have a free run while the other is shackled. That is contrary to my understanding of democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to be fair. I am equally anxious that misinformation is not given in publicly funded advertising, but the Government have recently announced that they are spending £300,000 on advertising school boards in Scotland. I have here an advertisement that appeared in the Scottish national press this week. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If you are interested in"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not quote in an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Martin. The advertisement says that if parents are interested in their children's education they will be interested in school boards, but that is incorrect. People may be interested in their children's education but do not want to take any interest in school boards. The two are not the same. The Scottish Office is misleading parents. Does the hon. Gentleman think that that is deplorable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must know that the necessary parliamentary machinery already exists to deal with any Secretary of State or Minister, or Department, who steps out of line. The hon. Gentleman is looking at me in wonder. Clearly he has not heard of the Public Accounts Committee and other bodies in the House that can, and will, draw attention to people who do not have the power or authority to act as they are. Recently changes have had to be made because Ministers did not have the authority to do what they were.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) does not think that I am prejudiced against anyone whose views differ from mine. Such a person may be influenced by the misinformation that is circulated. That happened on the community charge, as time will show. I am also confident that we must include the necessary legal definitions of what one can do to ensure that boards and parents are not frustrated or influenced by misinformation. Misinformation can originate from anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman lists alleged cases of misinformation given by English local authorities, will he tell us which Scottish local authorities have done so? They may have spent too much informing people and may be guilty of giving information that they should not give, but can he think of any cases where they have told their electorate lies? I do not think that he could cite a case that has been upheld by a relevant body and that is not merely his own opinion.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady tempts me, but I shall not go down that path because you, Mr. Martin, will rule me out of order. Nevertheless, I must tell her that I was a member of the Select Committee of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration for many years. I could give much evidence about the activities of Scottish local authorities which would answer the hon. Lady's question. My experience on that Committee led me to read the reports of the local authority ombudsman in Scotland. They sometimes covered my own local authority and they did not always express political views different to mine. My duty in Parliament is not to be purely partisan— although I hope that I defend my party's stance. In Committee, I try to ensure that the legislation will be fair to all those affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We agree on one point. Neither of us is in favour of elected bodies deliberately misleading their electorate. However, the hon. Gentleman is referring to another matter. I did not suggest that a council department has never misled an individual member of the public. I asked the hon. Gentleman whether a council had set out to deceive its entire electorate. I do not think that he can cite an instance where such an allegation has been upheld.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I can produce evidence, but I should be ruled out of order. I must stick to the narrow terms of the amendment. The hon. Lady has not been in Parliament long enough to realise that if I am enticed down the route that she suggests, I shall not be able to make the case that I wish to. I have been here long enough to resist the temptation. I have hard facts so I shall deal with the amendment.<br><br>
There has been misinformation about resources, reorganisation, travel, examinations, selection, purchasing for schools, teacher training, museums, library services, political influence and control in schools, future building programmes, the decision making process in schools, how all the children of an area were to be adversely affected, a minority request for a ballot which was unjustified, the control of finances, the uncertain future of education, access to schools and the threat of legal action. That final example is interesting in light of the earlier debate on one of my amendments.<br><br>
It is necessary to cite some of the examples in detail. I shall not mention every one, although I should be happy to do so. I bring the Committee's attention to the case in Derbyshire of teachers allocated £500 to circulate a document to parents. In that document, the teachers said:
<br><blockquote><p>"[The Parents' Association Committee] is largely made up of those same parents who as governors and members of the Parents' Action Group have made no secret of their enthusiasm for Grant-Maintained status."</p></blockquote>
That statement was untrue and painted a false picture. The number of parents who were also governors or members of the parents' action group was a minority on the parent's association committee. In fact, none of the parent's action group was on that committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If one considers that case what is even

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 675</span>
more worrying and makes the amendment so pertinent is that the director of education, Mr. John Evans wrote to parents and stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"An opted-out Chesterfield …"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would accept my previous ruling that he is not allowed to quote during an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue my intervention without quoting. That statement was made by a director of education, an official paid with ratepayers' money, but it is not true. If that school had opted out, there was no evidence to suggest that the local authority's schemes for tertiary education would have been affected. A local authority official used ratepayers' money to try to influence parents, which is disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. Writing about resources on 13 January 1989 John Evans said:
<br><blockquote><p>"An opted-out school would have no real additional resources and would still have to meet building regulations … lose County services … and access to educational initiatives."</p></blockquote>
In terms of the situation in England that is untrue. Anyone who reads the Bill will see that it would also be untrue in Scotland. I know of some paid officials who have put out misinformation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Charles Powell and Bernard Ingham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no hesitation in naming them. I have to deal with the level of the community charge and the information that was issued was very distorted. Scottish members will know what I am talking about. Let us suppose that a paid official in Scotland behaved in the manner that I am using as an example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What evidence does the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) have that that official deliberately misled parents? Perhaps when he gave that advice he believed that it was true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Martin. I did not hear the question because there was an interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat it. The hon. Gentleman said that an official, whose name I have forgotten, deliberately misled the public by giving facts about school resources which were untrue. Some of my hon. Friends are arguing that those facts were true. I do not know about that, but how does the hon. Gentleman know that the official did not believe his statements to be true when he made them? Has he any evidence that he did not believe them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring only in passing to an official giving out misinformation. In the case in question, the discrepancies in the figures were so huge that if that chap had worked for me on that income he would have been fired instantly and I have employed people who earned more than that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
Anyone who gives out such distorted information should be fired. The official was not fired, probably because his employers were happy that he gave out misinformation when he did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were handed that information only minutes before coming to the Committee, how does he know that it is accurate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I have the press releases that confirm the accuracy of my information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whose press releases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give me the opportunity to finish. I have not only the press releases but the press reports. There is no question in my mind that the information given to me this afternoon is accurate. I am sure that my hon. Friends who represent English constituencies, who know more details than I, will be only too happy to comment on the individual cases. I am sure that the hon. Member for Dundee, East will be delighted to be given chapter and verse.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was drawing the Committee's attention to the misinformation put out by English local authorities. For example:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ignoring the ballot could mean your child having to travel long distances to school."</p></blockquote>
That is not true.
<br><blockquote><p>"A new governing body would be able to begin the legal moves to introduce entrance examinations."</p></blockquote>
That is misleading. The leaflet was distributed in such a way that it was illegal, because it did not name the printer.
<br><blockquote><p>"Access to teacher training, museum, or library services will be lost or have to be purchased elsewhere."</p></blockquote>
That also was not true.
<br><blockquote><p>"Political influence will be handed from locally elected people to central Government."</p></blockquote>
That is not true, because the responsibility for running the school will transfer from the councillors to the governors.<br><br>
I could go on and on, but shall not as I do not wish to be accused of filibustering. I have given enough evidence, but have a further 20 pages that I could read through. I hope that the evidence clearly shows that some local authorities in England have been involved in a campaign of misinformation. It requires only one local authority in one part of Scotland to copy the actions of several authorities in England for the misinformation campaign to prevent the legitimate wishes of the people from being fulfilled. That is a negation of democracy.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister realises that I am speaking briefly on this matter not because I do not feel strongly about it, but because I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 677</span>
supplied sufficient evidence to enable him to accept my amendment. If he thinks that it is over the top, he can at least accept its principle and introduce another amendment. I assure my hon. Friend that the matter will not go away. Several of my colleagues support me. We feel strongly that local authorities cannot be allowed to indulge in a campaign of misinformation and to influence and frustrate the outcome of the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to amendment No. 190, because I am worried about the proposal put forward by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I cannot see why education authorities should be both denied the right to be involved in the decision-making process and asked by the Government to take on various responsibilities. There is a danger of opening a can of worms. The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that he wishes to avoid political influence that could be caused by misinformation, but I believe that local authorities in Scotland would do everything in their power to ensure that adequate information is given to people in their communities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has referred to the community charge and disinformation about it. One of the difficulties under which our authorities have laboured has been interpreting piecemeal legislation. Since the introduction of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987, there have been many consequent statutory instruments, and so on, which have made it very difficult for our authorities to look forward and provide adequate information at each stage in the process. These are genuine difficulties and there has been no deliberate attempt by the authorities to mislead people on the matter.<br><br>
I have gone through some reports of our previous sittings to study the issues that the Minister raised and the duties that were being placed on education authorities. The authorities are being asked to be involved at various stages in the process and take on serious responsibilities yet, if amendment No. 190 were accepted, they would not be allowed to involve themselves in the discussion about the possibility of a ballot taking place.<br><br>
I refer the hon. Member for Tayside, North to a very early sitting of the Committee. The Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"once the schools have been granted self-governing status… their finance will be guaranteed and will reflect the policies of the local authority."—<i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 16 March 1989; c.53.]</p></blockquote>
If the local authorities are being asked to ensure that their policies are reflected in the education of self-governing schools, surely at the same time they should be afforded the right to make comments during the process of a ballot being conducted to decide on self-governing status. I do not believe that we can have one without the other if we genuinely believe in democracy.<br><br>
About consultation with our education authorities, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any proposal for a change in the characteristics of a school, which is covered by clause 28, requires that the board of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
management should first consult the education authority."— <i>[Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21 March 1989; c. 133]</p></blockquote>
If the boards of management are being asked to consult the education authorities—presumably the boards of management would listen carefully to the authorities—there must be a right for the authorities to make available their comments to the wider constituency that is being asked to vote on these matters. If clear responsibilities are being placed on our education authorities, and there are clear demands for consultation, they should have a right to be involved in the process of opting out.<br><br>
I have faith in the elected authorities in Scotland. They may not be perfect, but none of us in this Committee would claim that we were perfect, either. I do not think that the hon. Member for Tayside, North was claiming infallibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should know that I live in a house full of women and I know for certain that I am not infallible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether to interpret that as a sexist remark or not. I certainly hope that the hon. Gentleman is under sensible guidance in his comments.<br><br>
I believe that we should place faith in our elected representatives regarding the democratic process and ensure that they have the right to pass comment on the process embarked upon by any board of management. That also includes the element of finance. Under clause 25(2), the education authority has a responsibility to draw up information for the Secretary of State for purposes of grant regulation. That money will be provided by all members of society through taxation and community charges— whether personal or property community charges. If we place those responsibilities on our education authorities, they have a right to be involved in the logical and sensible debate on opting out.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North spoke about the use of muscle and power to frustrate the outcome of ballots. I do not believe that our education authorities will do that, but they have a right to place before the electorate the realities of the situation. Again I return to the fact that, through the Bill, the Secretary of State is placing upon our education authorities various financial, policy and consultative responsibilities. When the hon. Member talks about frustrating the outcome of ballots, he exaggerates the position and has not taken into account the genuine need for our representatives within education authorities to be involved.<br><br>
Political influence is often accepted by Conservative Members when it suits them but when it expresses a contrary viewpoint, they reject the right of people to use their influence. I do not suggest that the education authorities would use political influence because I believe that the officials who are appointed to them have a clear duty to look at the issues objectively, and they would try hard to spell out the implications of any ballot that is being held within their area. We cannot condone legislation that suggests that education authorities have direct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 679</span>
responsibilities and at the same time denies them the right to speak out clearly on what they see as the implications for their areas and the other schools that come within their domain. I hope that amendment No. 190 will be rejected. All Opposition Members would reject any attempt at manipulation or the use of adverse publicity in this context, but amendment No. 190 goes far beyond that, because it denies elected representatives and the officials of our regional authorities the right to involve themselves in the decision. That is wrong and is contrary to the democratic process. I hope that the Committee will reject it on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tayside, North admitted that the wording of the amendment might be a bit defective. It is not merely slightly faulty: it does not begin to do what he was attempting to achieve. The whole thrust of his remarks was that he wanted to prevent education authorities from deliberately misleading the electorates for those schools, but his amendment says that they
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not take any action to influence the outcome of the ballot".</p></blockquote>
Those words would mean that they could not tell people the truth as they knew it about the possible outcome of such a ballot. They would be unable to tell them about the impact on the provision of professional services. They would be unable to point out that selection of some meant rejection of others or that if the school planned to do great things for high achievers, that might have an impact on low achievers unless certain steps were taken. They could not point out that there might be an effect on children with special needs. Those are all possibilities, but their hands would be tied and they would not be able to tell the electorate about it. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman intends.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to put down for discussion the idea that the council must not be allowed to mislead people deliberately. There is another point that he cannot have considered. He and his colleagues have kept saying, "Trust the parents." By the same token, cannot they trust the voters? We have had local government in Scotland for centuries. Even in the middle ages when the franchise was very small we had elected councils. At no point during the long history of local government has any sensible Government sought to forbid councils giving information of whatever type they wished. It is as simple as that. They have been trusted to be local government, not a local administration and not an arm of central Government. If they misled people and acted in wrongful and dishonest ways, they would pay a political penalty. If we are going to argue this measure for local government, by the same token central Government should take on the same standards for themselves and forbid themselves ever to listen to the people—although that will be the day.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I shall deal first with the less controversial amendments.<br><br>
On amendment No. 106, it may help the Committee if I begin by outlining how the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 680</span>
arrangements for operating a ballot of parents are expected to operate in practice. Clause 14 and schedule 3 lay the duty to conduct the ballot of parents on the school board. We assume, however, that the board will usually be partisan; usually, indeed, the board itself will have called the ballot because it favours the idea of self-governing status. Consequently, the Bill provides that the mechanics of the ballot should be put in the hands of an entirely independent body, to be designated or prescribed by the Secretary of State in terms of paragraph 1 of schedule 3.<br><br>
The Committee will be aware that in England and Wales the Electoral Reform Society has been designated for that purpose. We have held discussions with the society and while no commitment could be entered into on either side at this stage, I can say that I could expect a similar designation of the Electoral Reform Society to be appropriate in Scotland.<br><br>
The designated body would be responsible for printing and posting ballot papers and specified information about the ballot to those parents eligible to vote. There is a direct function for the school board in obtaining the parental roll from the education authority and providing the opportunity for parents to check that they are included on it before issue of the ballot papers. The designated body would also make the necessary arrangements for reply-paid envelopes, for return of completed ballot papers and for counting of the votes. No parent need feel that anyone connected with the school or the education authority would be involved in the opening and examination of ballot papers. I attach importance to that clear independence in the organisation of the ballot.<br><br>
The amendment is unnecessary because "independent" is not defined as such. I hope that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will accept my clear assurances. The point that I have made meets the substance of the amendment and the reasons why he tabled it.<br><br>
On amendment No. 107, I am intrigued by the suggestion that we should consult the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about arrangements for ballots. The local authorities are not going to be running those ballots. It will be for the school boards, and they will have to entrust the detailed running to the "prescribed body". If we thought that consultation with COSLA would guarantee that local authorities would behave sensibly and reasonably over application for self-governing status, we should, of course, be delighted to consult it. But there is no need to put that in statute.<br><br>
Amendment No. 190, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), is a draconian measure and I know that he will not be too disappointed if I tell him that I think that I would be a little unfair if I were to accept it. An education authority has a legitimate interest in the outcome of an opting-out ballot, but none the less, I have no wish to prevent education authorities from putting out factual statements of their views on a proposal for self-governing status for a school. That would go no further than local authorities' current powers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 681</span>
under section 88 of the Local Government Act 1988, as recently amended following the Widdecombe report, whereby they may arrange for the publication, within their areas, of information related to the functions of the authority.<br><br>
At the same time, councils are large organisations with considerable resources available to them. Obviously, it would be possible for a council to flood the market with propaganda that would outweigh any statements or opposing views that might be put forward by the school board or other groups that took a different view. The key question must be the volume and tone of any such information. Local authorities are currently required to have regard to a code of practice on publicity. The code issued by the Government in August last year provides, among other things that when a council uses publicity to comment on or respond to the policies and proposals of other bodies, it should be objective, balanced, informative and accurate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North made that plea to the Committee. I am happy to consider his points. The Committee will be able to consider the matter again when we discuss amendment No. 191.1 hope that my hon. Friend will be satisfied with those assurances and I am sure that the Committee is grateful to him for drawing our attention to the difficulties experienced. I ask my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Dundee, East not to press the amendments so that we can proceed to further consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances about the independence of the independent body that will arrange the ballots and for his concession that he will consult COSLA. I am happy not to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am happy with the Minister's comments. That may surprise him, but I am. Therefore, I shall not press my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>No. 66, in page 54, line 13, after "5", insert "at least 21 days".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. The amendments would give each eligible voter the relevant information 21 days before the date of the ballot. We urge the Minister to recognise the reasonableness of the amendments. The Bill does not specify a period before the ballot during which people can receive and weigh up information and make decisions on it. They must have some notice and 21 days is a reasonable period. We are pressing the point that the bill does not include such a timescale.<br><br>
We also want to push the point that parents will need to know the consequences of such planned changes in the arrangements for running the school so that those who vote in the ballot will be able to form a proper judgment. They will need to know what arrangements are likely for the provision of professional and ancillary services from the council and whether unregistered teachers will be employed. That was referred to in an earlier debate, but I should be glad if the Minister refreshed my memory. Parents will want to know what exclusions are likely, if any. They will want to know the school's policy on selection of some and rejection of others and what provision will be made for children with special needs. They will need information on a range of matters.<br><br>
This matter relates to clause 16, which we have still to debate. That clause covers such items as the policy on admission of pupils, whether any special emphasis will characterise the provision of education at the school, and other aspects of the management of the school as the school board thinks fit. The proposed date of implementation should be available in such circumstances.<br><br>
Another important point is whether a nursery class would be provided, and we shall discuss the provision of nursery education in Scotland later. Parents need to be aware of whether admission based on ability or aptitute, sex or religion would come into the picture. There are so many things that we would wish to know in such circumstances, and that clearly should be set out in the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 171 would ensure that all those eligible to vote are given the views of those employed at the school. This is also a vital amendment. It would help people to make judgments on the matter is they knew the opinions not only of the teachers but of other staff employed at the school. The teachers are the professionals in charge of the children's education so it is important to know what they think about the proposals. They might not necessarily vote them down out of hand, but may suggest some changes. They should be brought together in a reasonable relationship. People would also want to know whether cleaners were anticipating redundancies or low pay because that might affect their vote. They would want to know what would happen to the school dinner service. It would be reasonable to expect them to be informed on a range of matters.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 683</span>
We feel that more time is needed and that a certain amount of information should be outlined. We think that the information given by the staff is a vital part of the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said.<br><br>
It would be possible to achieve the effect required by amendments Nos. 15 and 16 administratively, by means of the Secretary of State's guidance. Whether it is really desirable to have ballot papers going out a full three weeks in advance is a matter that could probably do with longer consideration, in the context of the whole arrangements for ballots. In any case, one would want to consult whoever is going to be the prescribed body before entering into a commitment on a matter like this. We could meet the hon. Lady's point by giving a commitment that we would consider the desire for adequate notice in future; it would not be appropriate to write it into primary legislation.<br><br>
The key amendment is the manuscript amendment moved by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), which I am happy to accept. It is clearly desirable that voters in the ballot should know for what they are voting. The provisions of schedule 3 are in terms general enough to allow a wide range of information to be prescribed. However, the words in the manuscript amendment, which follow the pattern of the Education Reform Act add a measure of clarity. If they were inserted here, the effect would be that the regulations that we made would have to prescribe the information that should be given to voters, and the prescribed information would have to include the information about the consequences of self-governing status that a voter might reasonably be expected to need to enable him to form a proper judgement. The regulations themselves would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but I envisage that they would include an account an account of the admissions arrangements proposed, and of the school's approach to educating children with special educational needs. If possible, it would be desirable to include some details about the school's physical capacity and staffing levels. Some of this would need refinement and amplification in the formal proposals that would be published after the ballot, but I accept that voters would need basic information on these matters. They would also need some account of the statutory provisions of the Bill we are now debating, so that they could understand just what self-governing status means as a concept. This I envisage would be in a standard prescribed form.<br><br>
Therefore, there will be a further opportunity for further consideration of the matter. I hope that, on the basis of the fact that I am happy to accept the manuscript amendment, the other amendments will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a satisfactory answer, but will the Minister say a little about amendment No. 171?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 684</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 171 requires a statement of staff views to be circulated with the ballot paper. I recognise that the staff will have relevant views and that they undoubtedly have an interest. However, the Bill should not give any one group the right to have material circulated with the ballot paper, particularly as it could not easily be defined what other groups might claim similar interests.<br><br>
In the manuscript amendment, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has found a general formula for the information that would allow people to form a judgment. Clearly, the views of staff and other matters, such as what should be provided, can be discussed later—indeed, the board of governors would need to form a judgment on them. So although the point in amendment No. 171 is perfectly reasonable, writing it into the Bill is not an appropriate way to deal with the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a mixed bag of amendments, and they are not all the responsibility of the Labour party.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 would empower the Secretary of State to declare void any ballot carried out under clauses 14, 15 or 28 where the number of votes cast was less than half of the number of parents who were eligible to vote. Concern has been repeatedly expressed in the Committee throughout the day about the procedure whereby only 10 per cent, of parents can initiate the ballot procedure under the Bill. Conservative Members have been quick to point out that the protection for the majority view of parents lies in the fact that they will have a chance to express their wishes through the ballot when it is eventually held. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) gave several English examples. He said that out of 37 ballots, all of them had turnouts of between 53 and 81 per cent., although he later amended that to 88 per cent.<br><br>
The amendment would ask the Government for nothing of substance, because the Government clearly expect that, in every ballot held to decide whether a school should opt out, more than 50 per cent, of parents in the electorate will take part. We simply want the Government to write that into the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 686</span>
In a specific area of Scotland where many schools have small rolls, and some have only one or two teachers, a few parents abstaining can be significant. Therefore, it is important that we keep the legitimacy of the ballot result by ensuring that, where less than half the parents eligible to vote do so, there is a second ballot. Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 would require the Secretary of State to order a second ballot.<br><br>
Amendment No. 32 puts the onus of the second ballot on the school board rather than on the Secretary of State for Scotland. It says that where less than 50 per cent, of those eligible to vote actually do so, there must be a second ballot. It might be called the Bruce amendment—"Try, try and try again." However, the principle is the same: where less than half of those eligible to vote actually do so, the school's opting out of education authority control would be unacceptable.<br><br>
Amendment No. 31 to clause 16 and amendment No. 142 to clause 28 deal with the part of the Bill that specifies that
<br><blockquote><p>"a simple majority of votes cast"</p></blockquote>
will be sufficient in the ballot for opting out. We seek to replace that simple majority with a two thirds majority of those parents eligible to vote. That principle sprang initially from the Scottish Consumer Council and applies to the standing orders of bowling and drinking clubs. If it can be applied in those circumstances, it should be applied in schools that are facing major decisions about opting-out or changing their characteristics—such as transferring from coeducational to single sex. Such major decisions must be made by the overwhelming majority of parents and there must be no doubt. I urge the Minister to accept the principle that lies behind those amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 120 deals with the stage of the procedure after the ballot has been carried out, when a majority is in favour of opting out and the proposal goes to the Secretary of State who has the power to reject or amend it. Amendment No. 120 would ensure that in reaching his decision, the Secretary of State has regard not merely to the result of the ballot, but to the number of parents who voted yes as a proportion of those eligible to vote. That is reasonable.<br><br>
Amendment No. 155 would apply the same principle to the Secretary of State's actions in deciding on the proposals for changing a school's characteristics under clause 28. The board of management could decide to change from primary only to primary and secondary or from secondary only to secondary and primary. It could decide not to have a nursery class, not to have special educational needs, to change the school's admission criteria to reflect ability and aptitude rather being based on the comprehensive principle that applies currently, to change to a single-sex school, or to change to or from a denominational school. All these would be important changes.<br><br>
So far, we have had no clear answer from the Under-Secretary or the Secretary of State about what support parents would be required to demonstrate before the Secretary of State agrees to such changes. I hope that they accept that there should be no lack

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 687</span>
of commitment to the principle that no changes, or the school opting out of education authority control, would be acceptable unless it were demonstrated that a clear majority of parents supported that.<br><br>
There is nothing extravagant in the amendments, and nothing that the Under-Secretary cannot accept. They deal with the basic democratic principle that major changes to the way in which a school is run cannot be made unless the overwhelming view of the parents of the children in that school is that those changes should take place. Where doubt exists, the responsibility lies with the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State to say no and to wait until the parents make a clear, decisive choice that they support those changes. The amendments would include that responsibility in the Bill, and I hope that the Under-Secretary considers them closely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendments Nos. 176 and 133 in the name of the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston). They emphasise the basic principles that are at stake. We are seeking a clean and simple majority of parents who are eligible to vote in a ballot. I hope that the Minister will consider the democratic principles that underpin the amendments, including those to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) spoke. I look forward to hearing the Minister respond positively to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are about the nature of the majority needed in a ballot. The simple majority provided by the Bill means, as in a parliamentary election, a majority of those voting. If the provision were that the majority required was a majority of all those entitled to vote, it would mean that an abstention counted as a vote against.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just like the 40 per cent. rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Lady does not support that, so perhaps I can enlist her support for my argument. There would be no possibility of distinguishing between those who positively opposed the change and those who were undecided or simply did not care.<br><br>
The matter is significant, so each parent should consider seriously what would be involved and whether he or she wanted the proposal to go ahead. There is a real difference between a situation in which 30 per cent, of people vote in favour of the proposal and 20 per cent, vote against, and one in which 30 per cent, vote in favour and 70 per cent, vote against. That distinction disappears if abstentions count as votes against, as the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will remember.<br><br>
If 70 per cent, of the electorate vote against a proposal, it stops there, and rightly so. But a vote in which there is a majority in favour on a comparatively low poll needs some interpretation. One would have to consider all the other factors affecting the school and the representations received from the public on the proposal, feeder primaries
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
and other matters. Those and other factors would have to be given relatively greater weight than if the ballot result had been decisive. But it would be wrong that, when as many as 30 per cent, of the electorate had voted in favour, the application could not even be considered, even though most voters had not even bothered to express a preference.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I recognise the strength of feeling behind the amendments. The requirements proposed by amendment No. 31 of two thirds of those eligible to vote would create some difficult problems of the opposite sort. After all, a result that fell only just short of that would still be a decisive vote in favour of opting out. It would be intolerable if a school in that position could not even be considered as an applicant for self-governing status. We cannot go along with that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 32, to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) spoke, and amendment No. 133, to which the hon. Member for Moray spoke, are another matter altogether. They represent a reasonable compromise in a matter that worries many of those who have commented on our proposals. Drafting may need attention from a technical point of view but, in principle, I am happy to accept the concept that, when there are fewer than 50 per cent, of the votes on the first occasion, there should be a second and decisive round.<br><br>
A similar procedure for any future ballots on the change or characteristics would be appropriate in clause 28. Such a provision for a second ballot answers the claim that, somehow, a school could be taken out of local authority control by a small clique of people springing a decision on parents. Therefore, the second round will alert everyone to the likely outcome of the ballot. Parents who, for whatever reason, express no preference on the first occasion would have another chance to make their votes count. It must be the votes of those who turn out that determine the outcome of the ballot, and whether the issue should move to the stage of formal proposals.<br><br>
I hope that I have responded suitably to the arguments that have been advanced from the Committee and outside it. I am unable to accept the other amendments, but I give the Committee an undertaking to come back on Report with a proposal that is correct technically and reflects the spirit and intentions of amendments Nos. 32 and 133.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the absence in Committee of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He is with his family and they are attempting to catch the 10.30 pm train to Scotland. I agree to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the Minister's response. We look forward to discussing the issues further on Report.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate the difficulty of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). However, because he moved the amendment, the Question must be put.</span></p>
