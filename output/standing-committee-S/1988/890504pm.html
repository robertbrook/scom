	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 269, in page 40, line 23, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that such matters do not embrace activities which are detrimental to the provision of further education.".</p></blockquote>
This clause is about the power of education authorities to form companies to manage colleges of further education—a provision to which we are not opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a company is so formed and starts to set up committees, there is the danger of a conflict—intentional or otherwise—in that the generation of income and profit becomes an end in itself rather than an adjunct to the good conduct of, and for the benefit of, the college or institution. That is why we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
should like the amendment inserted at the end of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are not opposed to the principles involved, but we should like to put a belt and braces on the provision to ensure that it is not detrimental, although the number of times that it would be detrimental are no doubt limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to our proceedings, Miss Boothroyd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is helpful. The Educational Institute of Scotland, which was responsible for its genesis, fears that some companies set up to manage further education colleges may engage in non-educational activities, which could overwhelm their further education role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a difficulty with the drafting of the amendment. It is difficult to get the correct balance of wording to allow scope for activity while not producing a definition that may be the subject of endless argument about what is in the interests of the college. If the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) will seek to withdraw the amendment, I shall consider whether we can find a form of words and return to the matter on Report. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an absolute guarantee, but we shall try to meet his requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend explain why the clause is worded in such a way that the education authority has to take the initiative, and thereby has the veto? Why does the education authority have so much power over colleges but not over schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that was the basis of COSLA's and the education authorities' representations. It was thought appropriate that corporate colleges should be set up with the education authority's consent. There would be difficulties if the education authority did not agree to corporate status. The clause, therefore, provides for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that I am making alternative representations now, and I have not yet received an answer from my hon. Friend the Minister. It is not good enough for him to say that COSLA does not agree with my views. It probably does not agree with my views on any subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point, but it might be easier for me to respond and for him to put his case on the clause stand part debate, instead of on this amendment, which deals with a difficulty that arises over the activities in which a company can be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the education authority remains the principal authority, because in Strathclyde many colleges of education have already undertaken commercial work. When I spoke to the principal of Clydebank college a few weeks ago, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
said that about 40 per cent, of work at the 16 to 18 stage had been commercialised. The college has established courses and received revenue for them. I cannot remember the amount of money that the principal mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a coherence of provision in colleges where many different groups and employers are involved. Setting ideology aside, I believe that the education authority would be the best body to deal with that, because it is in contact with all the agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the Minister said, those matters are best dealt with in a clause stand part debate, but I shall allow the Minister to make a brief reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Miss Boothroyd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) may be talking about clause 56, which deals with FE colleges involved in commercial activities; clause 59, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle may wish to return on the clause stand part debate, deals with the formation of corporate colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, amendment No. 269 is deficient. I cannot give him a commitment, but I promise to consider the matter and to return to it on Report if we come up with a form of words that will deal with the hon. Gentleman's anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made.</i> No. 276, in page 40, line 26, leave out "made" and insert "agreed".</p>
	<p>No. 277, in page 40, line 28, leave out "made and insert "agreed".—	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps this is an appropriate time to repeat my question to my hon. Friend the Minister. I hope that he can at least give me an undertaking that he will reconsider the issue and return with an answer on Report. If not, I shall press him further on Report. I am not happy that we are adopting a philosophy to colleges that is different from the philosophy that we have adopted to schools throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless my views are taken into account, the provisions in clause 59 will never take effect, as education authorities will always impose a veto. I do not understand why my hon. Friend cannot answer my simple question. Why, in this instance—unlike in similar instances elsewhere in the Bill—is he giving such power to education authorities when they are totally out of kilter with his thinking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the speech of the hon. Member for Gainsborough
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) because obviously he does not agree that education authorities should decide whether to form corporate colleges. He wants the Government to empower college councils to be able to break away from education authority control. He is in favour of privatising further education colleges in Scotland, as he is in favour of privatising education authority schools. Self-governing schools are only a midway point between education authority schools and complete privatisation. That is why he supports the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right that the Minister, who adopted that philosophy towards education authority schools, has now departed from it when considering further education colleges. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say about that. In the big green box in the Library, there are several documents relating to this part of the Bill. Reference document No. 47 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Michael Forsyth has not ruled out corporate status for colleges, following legislation for England and Wales."</p></blockquote>
Although that is not part of the Bill—the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle is right to say that it is not in clause 59—the Minister intends to go further in future. The reference document quotes him as saying that some day
	<br><blockquote><p>"corporate colleges would be 'free of the many petty local authority restrictions imposed by local government legislation'."</p></blockquote>
Like the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle, I am interested to know the Minister's intentions. While I agree with the Minister and with the clause as it is drafted, I suspect that there is something else afoot. Although the Minister has denied having a hidden agenda, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle certainly has such an agenda and thought that the Minister had one, too. That is why he pulled up the Minister on this issue, believing that they had agreed to privatise further education colleges and wondering why clause 59 did not permit that. Everyone in further education in Scotland will be interested in the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I came on to this Committee, I did not foresee the possibility that one day I should be coming to the aid of the Minister as he fended off the Right-wing extremism of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). However, in this case, there are practical reasons why the clause is framed as it is and not as the hon. Gentleman suggests. College managements will consist of many people. More than half the boards will be local employers and all will naturally want to promote their interests, perhaps to the detriment of other competing businesses, and they will have no regard for businesses that are not in their line of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle might not be aware of it, but in Scotland many companies have gone out of business in the past 10 years or so. Local employers—in the building trade, foundry work, shipbuilding or railway engineering—might no longer exist. It would be more narrowly based as time went on. I am not saying that the Government do not care about the levels of unemployment in areas such as Maryhill, where the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
official figure is 20 per cent., but in reality it is much higher. In such areas, many local employers are small businesses and few employ more than 10O people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited those companies and they tell me that they have quite enough to do trying to run their businesses, make a profit and keep the people that they employ without spending much time on other pursuits. They might not want these powers if the education authority is not in agreement. The education authority's views should be sought because it will know the local picture and whether such a possibility is realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) should let the clause stand as it is because it deals with the real world and allows for proper consideration. If the Minister were to accept the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, things could fall apart in further education before too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). A principle is involved, and we must take it seriously. I rebut fully the allegations made about further education in Scotland. It is today, as it always has been, facing change. I remember when examinations for craft skills were changed and when they were being phased out and other skills were being introduced. Changes were also made in the postwar period to meet the needs of those who had not had the good fortune to stay at school and obtain the necessary qualifications for higher education. The colleges responded magnificently and will continue to do so, but they must work in close cooperation with the employers in the local community who will be offering employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support my hon. Friend and his points should be taken seriously by my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said. Why are education authorities, in effect, being allowed to veto any proposal for a further education college to become a company? I used to work in a further education college in the private sector. Any fear that it would be a second-rate college and not take account of educational developments was unfounded. Although it was in the private sector, it competed with colleges in the public sector. It does not matter which sector a college is in because the quality of education will be as high or low, depending on market forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister explain why an education authority is allowed to have a veto? My experience is that authorities will use that veto. They have a vested interest and will not willingly give up their functions, staff and role. The Minister is, in effect, preventing colleges from developing into companies. Why would an education authority decide that one of its colleges was so good that it should be allowed to go into the private sector? The bad colleges would obviously not want to form themselves into companies anyway. The clause will
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
depress the quality of education and restrict choice. The necessary safeguards are there because the consent of the Secretary of State is needed. I ask him to justify more clearly why he wants education authorities to have a veto and prevent the clause being carried out as he hopes it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends propose a fundamental change in the basis for establishing corporate colleges but they have not said how they would see it working. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle talked about the apparent contradiction in policy. In part I there is a natural constituency of parents of children in the school who are able to take a decision on self-governing status, There is no such natural constituency in a further education college. Who would take the decision to go for what would effectively be independent status? The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was almost right when he talked about privatising the college. It would certainly be independent but it would still be funded in the main by the local authority under some form of contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did we not spend all morning talking about the role of the governing bodies of colleges and giving them more power, and about how we would make these governing bodies more relevant to the wider community, particularly employers? My hon. Friend now comes back with the extraordinary statement that he does not think that these bodies are capable of acting in a rational manner. He is not being logical. Given the political composition of education authorities in Scotland, unless he is prepared to amend the clause, does he expect a single company to be formed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Corporate colleges have been formed in England and Wales on the basis proposed in the Bill, that is by agreement between the education authority and the Secretary of State. I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's point, and he is dividing my loyalties between his intellectual argument and the practical ability to deliver this. I cannot pretend to have thought this through and I am not certain that my hon. Friend has either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are making progress. As my hon. Friend the Minister has admitted that he has not thought the matter through, will he undertake to take it away and think about it? We might be able to reach a decision later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If for no other reason than to persuade my hon. Friend not to pursue the matter, I should be happy to consider further the points that he has made. If he wants to find an opportunity to debate it at a later stage in our proceedings, it is obviously open for him to do so. I cannot give him any commitment, but I have noted the points that he and my hon. Friends the Members of Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Hexham (Mr. Amos) have made. I shall look at the practicalities. Perhaps my hon. Friend has some ideas or suggestions on the practical difficulties. If a local authority is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
agreeable to a corporate college, I do not see how there could be a workable relationship between it and the corporate college. I shall certainly look at the matter again and consider any suggestions that my hon. Friend makes between now and Report. I hope that he will be able to support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I felt sorry for the Minister as he squirmed under the attacks of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle. I thought of throwing him a few lifelines by giving him the reasons why clause 59 is correct. However, I decided to let the Minister think about the matter for a little longer. If he needs any help to defend himself against his hon. Friends, he should come to see me later and I shall give him some confidential information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Opposition have to move this amendment. It will improve and tighten up the Bill, which is unclear on the issue. All yesterday evening, we were told how inexperienced we were. Against us are the Minister backed up by his civil servants and Conservative Back Benches replete with hon. Members who have been in the House for 10 years. They read the Bill line by line, suggest amendments and consider others to see whether they should add their name to them. Therefore, I am amazed that none of them picked up this problem. They have not even added their names to the amendment. Greatly experienced Conservative Members pore over the Bill, burn the midnight oil and do not go out at night to the pub. They read every line, take out Webster's dictionary to check the meanings and then consult their lawyers, but they do not see the problem with this clause. Therefore, in a spirit of co-operation, the Opposition have tabled the amendment to help out the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having seen the amendment, the Minister will realise that the problem with clause 61 is that subsection (3) is unclear. The Bill mentions further education, but it means education authority education. Indeed, clause 69 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'colleges of further education' means an educational establishment, under the management of an education authority, for the provision of any form of further education".</p></blockquote>
That is the definition in the Bill, but clause 61(3)(a) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any group of teaching staff employed in or in connection with the provision of further education in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
That seems to mean education authority provision.

The SJNC, which the clause will abolish, was set up under the Education (Scotland) Act 1981, which amended the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. The SJNC refers to the central institutions and colleges of education as well as education authority colleges. Clause 61(2Xb) deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"a settlement formulated under section 94(1 Kb) of the 1980 Act".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we assume that the clause covers the negotiating rights in both central institutions and the colleges of education. We do not necessarily agree with the abolition of the SJNC—we shall come to that later—but we believe that the clause intends to cover all the institutions. However, clause 61 (3) refers to further education and the matter is not clear.

The amendment is designed to clarify the position and help the experienced Government and their Back Benches who pore over such things but for some reason have not picked up the problem. That is done in a spirit of wishing to help because we do not want endless, tedious disputes in the courts when the Bill is enacted.

Section 94 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 established the Scottish joint negotiating committee and gave it the function of considering and formulating settlements for the remuneration and conditions of service of teaching staff employed in or in connection with the provision of further education. Such teaching staff are described in section 94 as those employed by education authorities and by the governing bodies of colleges of education and of central institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 61(1) refers to section 94 of the 1980 Act, so it is clear that the reference to teaching staff employed
	<br><blockquote><p>"in or in connection with the provision of further education in Scotland"</p></blockquote>
embraces all the teaching staff referred to in section 94 of the 1980 Act; that is, it includes not only teaching staff employed by education authorities, but those employed by the governing bodies of colleges of education or central institutions. For that reason, the proposed amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my interpretation, too, and the Minister is correct. But will he consider subsection (3)(a) of clause 61, which contains the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in connection with the provision of further education in Scotland"?</p></blockquote>
The definition of further education in the Bill is local authority education. Clause 69, on page 46, states that a
	<br><blockquote><p>"'college of further education' means an educational establishment, under the management of an education authority, for the provision of any form of further education".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister understands the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's problem. Clause 61(1) refers to section 94 of the 1980 Act. It seems clear that the reference to

embraces all those bodies which are covered by section 94 of the 1980 Act. I have the Act with me. It refers to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"education authorities in Scotland; and … governing bodies of colleges of education, or of central institutions, in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
Clause 69(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'College of further education' means an educational establishment, under the management of an education authority, for the provision of any form of education".</p></blockquote>
That is a definition not of further education but of a college of further education. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's amendment does not stand up, and I hope that he will be prepared to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister's advisers can tell us differently, but I thought that further education and the central colleges were combined in negotiating machinery some six years ago, not in 1980. Therefore, it could be that, while the measure was worded correctly in 1980, the later events that brought the two together leave matters unclear. Subsection (3)(a) could be taken to refer only to further education colleges. Far be it from me to tidy up the Government's business, but that is what my hon. Friend is driving at. There could be disputes over whether the measure applied to the central colleges. If that were how some clever lawyer read the matter, they might not be able to move in a way that further education colleges could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It refers to section 94 of the 1980 Act, and makes clear that, as clause 61(1) refers to section 94, the reference to teaching staff employed in, or in connection with, further education in Scotland embraces all the teaching staff referred to in section 94 of the 1980 Act. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden argued that there was a definition of further education which I cannot find. His reference to clause 69 was to a definition of a college of further education. Therefore, the advice tendered is based on a false premise and an understandable misreading of clause 69.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 61 should not stand part of the Bill, as is obvious from its provision through which the Government abolish unilaterally the Scottish joint negotiating committee for further education. The unilateral abolition is strange because, although the idea for the committee sprang from the 1974 Houghton report, it was established by the same Conservative Government through the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and later through the Education (Scotland) Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, several Conservative Members spoke about 10 glorious years of Conservative rule. No doubt they were all present at a London hotel yesterday and paid £35 each for the doubtful privilege of listening to the Prime Minister reminiscing and drinking wine that one of them described as fit for fluid for a car battery. It is obvious that the Government have made mistakes during those 10 glorious years as they are going back on something that they set up. They are trying to abolish the Scottish joint negotiating committee. What are their reasons for abolishing a committee that they set up to facilitate national wage agreements and agreements on conditions of work for people in the further education sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State gave some of the reasons. I note that he is absent again although he claimed in a debate last night that he was a leading member of the Committee. Perhaps he thinks that today is Wednesday because he thought that yesterday was Thursday. He does not know what day it is so perhaps he thinks that the Committee is not sitting today because he believes it is Wednesday. Almost a year ago he was asked about the abolition of the SJNC. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the Government's view the 40-strong statutory committee has proved a cumbersome and ineffective forum for negotiating the pay and conditions of academic staff in the local authority further education colleges and in the centrally-funded colleges.</p></blockquote>
If we examine the first reason, we could read into the words "cumbersome and ineffective" the fact that the Government believe that the SJNC is not hard enough on people working in the public education sector. It has allowed them to earn too decent wages and secure too decent conditions of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two distinct sectors in further education. The Secretary of State said that they had different funding sources and different conditions of service, and that the pressures facing management were different. He was referring to the further education colleges run by education authorities and to the central institutions and colleges of education, which have their own governing bodies and are funded directly by the Scottish Education Department. He tried to explain further why it was inappropriate to allow the SJNC to continue to negotiate for both sectors. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"progress has been disappointing … from time to time in recent years we have received representations from both management and staff interests about the unsatisfactory nature of the present arrangements."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 24 June 1988; Vol. 1454; c. 	<i>749.]</i></p></blockquote>
When the Minister replies to the clause stand part debate, I hope that he will say what those representations were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received the amendments tabled by the trade unions representing the staff of the SJNC, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
suggested that the whole clause should be deleted. Far from making representations to the Minister that the staff are unhappy with the SJNC, the union says that the SJNC, which was constituted in January 1982,
	<br><blockquote><p>"has operated effectively, using negotiating sub-committees where necessary for local authority and for centrally-funded colleges."</p></blockquote>
That is not what the Secretary of State suggested in his parliamentary answer. The union continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The staff value its statutory protection for salaries and conditions of service. It has never provoked the prolonged industrial conflicts experienced in the schools and the universities."</p></blockquote>
Further education colleges have not experienced that industrial action. It went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The staff have demonstrated a flexible approach to the problems posed by the separate funding arrangements for the different college sectors"</p></blockquote>
by the creation of two separate negotiating subcommittees. It winds up by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The committee was prompted by the Houghton Report of 1974 which stressed the need to ensure that salaries in the different sectors maintained a relationship which reflected similarities of work. This remains a sound objective. The SJNC (FE) has been effective in pursuing it."</p></blockquote>
That is the staff side, yet the Secretary of State says in a parliamentary answer that he has had representations from the staff about the unsatisfactory nature of the present arrangements. The two do not gel, and the Minister must explain to the Committee who is telling the truth. Is the staff union telling the truth when it says that the SJNC has been doing a good job, or is the Secretary of State for Scotland telling the truth when he says that the staff have approached him to say that they are dissatisfied with how the SJNC has been doing its job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government intend to abolish the SJNC, with what will they replace it? Several references have been made to the Government's consultation document, issued in 1987, which sets out their intentions. The section headed "Responsibilities as to Staffing" refers to the delegation of staffing matters to the college councils and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such delegation of staffing matters would not affect national agreements currently in force on pay and conditions for college staff, but subject to such agreements, the Government expects that councils would be free to determine the numbers and grading of college staff without reference to the education authority, within the discipline of their approved budgets. The staff would, however, remain as employees of the education authority."</p></blockquote>
So the consultation document says that staff will remain as the employees of the education authority and that their wages and working conditions will remain subject to the national agreements arrived at through the SJNC. That was the Government's intention when they issued the consultation document in 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in a parliamentary answer on 24 June 1988, the Secretary of State for Scotland said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the light of this evidence of the difficulties inherent in working within the present SJNC(FE)"—</p></blockquote>
there is no evidence of any difficulties, as the staff are very happy with the SJNC—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I intend taking the first legislative opportunity to abolish the committee."</p></blockquote>
He then explained what he would replace the committee, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not wish to reach a conclusion at the present time on the precise form of any replacement negotiating machinery as this is a matter on which the interests concerned in the two sectors will themselves have views.</p></blockquote>
My Officials stand ready to assist the various parties in divising alternative arrangements which better reflect the needs of management and staff at all levels in the two sectors."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 24 June 1988; Vol. 135, 	<i>c.749-750.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of the consultation paper, the Government said that they intended to leave the national agreements in place. The Secretary of State then announced, in June 1988, his intention to do away with the SJNC but to replace it with some other form of machinery, which he would negotiate with the staff and management. Then the Government introduced the Bill and we found that it contained nothing about replacement—just a simple, bold statement that the Government will abolish the SJNC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the debate has developed, we are beginning to get a better idea of what might take the SJNC's place. On close examination of clause 61, it becomes clear that teaching staff employed anywhere in the further education sector will be able to negotiate with their employers to change the national agreements that operate for those employees. The employers could be any of a number of groups. They could continue to be the education authorities—they could be the Scottish Office—which controls the central institutions through the governing bodies—or they could be the new corporate colleges. Although the Minister's hon. Friends were worried that clause 59 would not allow colleges to opt out of education authority control, it is clearly the Minister's intention that that will happen. As he said, it has already happened in England, with the agreement between education authorities and the Secretary of State for Education and Science there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i> a few weeks ago, an article referred to 19 different institutions—colleges and ploytechnics—that are transferring from local authority control and will receive an extra payment on account to enable them to meet the commitments of wages, working conditions, and so on. A company of accountants has been employed, and its prime concern will be assessing whether the 19 institutions can stop the money going missing and ensure that it is paid to the right people. In other words, the company is assessing whether privatised colleges can manage their budgets, reach agreements with their staff and find the money to pay them. The institutions are preparing for incorporation, as the report says. That is the Minister's fundamental aim in respect of the FE sector in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article refers to the kind of problems that arise when colleges opt out of education authority control and become corporate colleges, moving into the private sector. The article says that the institutions anticipate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"lean financial times ahead. There are fears that teaching posts will be frozen"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
because of "severe budget constraints". Income in one college is up 2 per cent., its student numbers are up 5 per cent., but inflation is up to 7 per cent. As a result, something will have to give, and that something will probably be the employment of teachers in those corporate colleges. The article says that meanwhile, lecturers at one of the polytechnics have joined colleagues at several other institutions.
	<br><blockquote><p>"protesting about management behaviour, restructuring and new-style contracts."</p></blockquote>
That is the picture emerging in England, and the Minister intends that it should also emerge in Scotland. He hopes that corporate colleges will emerge from this process, opting out of education authority control and going their own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between Scotland and England is that the Conservative-controlled local authorities in England are keen to help the Secretary of State and want the privatisation of further education colleges, but in Scotland, there are no education authorities under Conservative control and they do not wish colleges to break away and be privatised under the college councils. That was the point that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle made to the Minister, who said something like, "If you can show me a practical way of achieving it, I'll go with you." because the Minister suspects the same thing himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no corporate college in Scotland because the education authorities are controlled by political parties—not always Labour—which do not share the Government's philosophy that education should be privatised. They believe that it should be provided by the State, funded nationally, but controlled locally by people directly elected by the electorate. That is the vision of the majority of people in Scotland, and the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle and the Minister do not like it. The Government have failed to find a practical way to achieve in Scotland what they have already begun to achieve in England through the Conservative-controlled authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abolition of the SJNC is serious for lecturers and other employees in further education, who will see their wages and conditions eroded. I fear that this is part of a jigsaw which, when all the pieces are put together, is aimed at the privatisation of further education. That idea has already been suggested by the hon. Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Hexahm (Mr. Amos), and even supported by the Minister. The only difference is that the Minister is faced with the practical job of achieving the privatisation of further education, and he cannot see how it can be achieved in Scotland. That is the only thing that stops him agreeing completely with his hon. Friends. No doubt we shall come back to this matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent of the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) wrote to the hon. Member for Tayside, North by mistake—he was not the hon. Gentleman's constituent, as I originally thought—saying that he worked in the further education sector in Scotland and was appalled by the policies being pursued by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The letter sums up the views of thousands of voters across Scotland who, in 1974, shared the views of the Conservative party, but in 1989, after 10 years of Thatcherism, are appalled by the policies of the new Right and do not want to be associated with it.

This is a serious attack on the rights of employees in further education and on that sector itself. It is a necessary part of the privatisation plan that Conservative Back Benchers are honest enough to admit exists, but whose existence the Minister will not admit publicly. Privately, the Minister would love to see the plans implemented in Scotland, if only there were a practical way of doing so. When he stumbles on a practical way, we can look forward to the privatisation of further education in Scotland. However, I hope that he will not get that far, because we may have had another general election and a Scottish Parliament before then.

In one case, which began under my predecessor, Douglas Crawford, and continued under me for almost eight years, it was clear where the flaws and deficiencies were.

As a matter of principle—this has nothing to do with the detail, about which I have a thick file—in 1965 and from 1978 to 1979 there was a great deal of theory about the right way to negotiate on conditions of service. Unnecessary committees and quangos were established, but instead of improving matters, they often made more links in the chain of negotiation, which made matters more difficult.

They had problems in the past because they had different sources of funding and different conditions of service. It was difficult to conduct wage negotiations when further education colleges, funded by local authorities, were willing to move half a per cent, at a time during negotiations, but centrally funded colleges, which relied fully on Government money, were less able to be flexible.

The different conditions of service also created difficulties because one set of colleges had a greater class contact time and a different pay scale. Those difficulties were overcome in the last two negotiation rounds, because two negotiation groups were set up; a move that was supported by both management and staff. To argue that the difficulties arose because of the difference in conditions and pay is hardly an argument for abolishing the negotiating machinery; it is an argument for making access easy to negotiating machinery for both groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that we cannot press the Secretary of State on this matter, because he is absent from Committee. His reply on 24 June 1988 was misleading, albeit unintentionally. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not wish to reach a conclusion at the present time on the precise form of any replacement negotiating machinery as this is a matter on which the interests concerned in the two sectors will themselves have views."</p></blockquote>
No one would think that such an answer meant that the forum would simply cease to exist. It was expected that an alternative forum would be on offer after discussions with the relevant bodies. Did those discussions take place? What happened? Have all concerned said that they want to abolish that machinery? It is said in Parliament that one should never ask a question unless one knows the answer to it, but I feel confident that at least the trade union side would not want to abolish the machinery entirely, whatever the management side thought. When and over what period were those views sought?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My officials stand ready to assist the various parties in devising alternative arrangements which better reflect the needs of management and staff at all levels in the two sectors."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 24 June 1988; Vol. 135, 	<i>c.750]</i></p></blockquote>
Again, if the Secretary of State's officials were involved, when was it thought that the needs of the staff would be better served by abolishing the machinery? That is nonsense. In what way was the system held to be ineffective? I do not think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
further education teachers would consider the system to be ineffective. That is not to say that every member of a teaching union is always satisfied with the results of the annual negotiating round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, the maximum number of hours of class contact a week, on a notional 32 and a half hour week, of which 30 are worked in the college, is 24, but in practice is 22. That is an immense improvement on 10 years ago, when class contact hours were as high as 28 in many colleges in Scotland. That may sound like technical detail to anyone who has never worked in further education or in teaching generally, but I can tell hon. Members that teaching various classes for 28 hours a week destroys one's ability to teach well all the different subjects and classes involved. In further education, a teacher may have to cover a variety of subjects and classes, more so for general studies than for crafts. Attempting to cover that class contact load and to prepare properly for it in the remaining hours requires a great deal of work. Some teachers could not cope with that, so they pressed strongly in the intervening years to reduce class contact hours so that they could do a better job for the students. Much FE work gives people who may have failed in their school days a second chance in life. It is, therefore, all the more important that teachers are able to do their best for students. It was in the interests of students that hours were reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the Government are moving towards abolishing the negotiating machinery. If individual colleges are left to negotiate hours and conditions, those achievements will be wiped away. Colleges will depend on the local market for teaching staff, across the board and within subjects, and they might offer what they know they can get away with. Teachers desperate for a job will accept such teaching hours, knowing full well that they will be unable to do the best job possible for the students; but a teaching job, whatever the difficulties, is better than no job at all. So they will take the work and the college management will say, "Good, we have managed to get someone to work for 28 hours' class contact when before it was 24 or 22." That is a short-sighted policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, further education staff enjoy 49 days' annual leave plus 11 public days, so they get almost as many as we do in Parliament. Further education lecturers are unlikely to argue that the negotiating machinery is ineffective when their holidays are better than those in most other sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw hon. Members' attention to the recent new pay round, which makes the new starting salary for a further education lecturer £10,986 at point 1. In reality, few lecturers would start at point 1 because most people working in further education have spent some years in industry and so would start at a higher point in the scale. Given that the scale now goes up by approximately £540 per annual step, a lecturer could start not at nearly £11,000, but at around £13,000 or £14,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, further education is doing not at all badly on pay. Traditionally, its lecturers have done better than teachers in schools, which is unfortunate for teachers, who also deserve a decent salary. Teachers in schools do not have the same advantages as those who work in further education and who have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
always had the hold over management that they could go back into industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that has taken place in the teeth of Government opposition. The Government acted in various ways to try to prevent those improvements in pay, holidays and hours which, as I have argued, benefit the students as well as the staff. The anti-trade union legislation, which prohibited secondary picketing, meant, farcically enough, that when we took industrial action over our pay claim several years ago, I discovered that, legally, I could picket the annex, but not the main building because I did not work there. The Government have tried to make teachers' industrial action less effective through such measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have recognised the Professional Association of Teachers—a so-called trade union whose intention is to gather together people who do not believe in taking industrial action in support of their claims. Such people are disloyal to colleagues who believe that sometimes it is necessary to take action, not just for themselves as teachers, but for the sake of students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East mentioned, the Government have cut local authority budgets over the years, so the Labour-controlled authorities especially have been in difficulty. They might have wanted to recognise just claims from FE staff, as well as from all other working groups, but have found it extremely difficult to do so because of the enormous cuts in local authority funding. Despite such pressures, the FE sector has managed to make reasonable gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the abolition of the negotiating machinery takes effect, different colleges will come to their own arrangements and that will make the education bill a great deal cheaper. While some might be able to hold out for a reasonable pay increase in a particular year, or hold on to existing hours and holidays because of the local muscle that they wield, it is easier to do that on a national than on a local scale. Some teachers have always been more inclined to give in and not resist the Government's unreasonable stance and, in the past, they have been outvoted by their colleagues. But faced with a college management that says, "That is the deal, take it or leave it", many will feel that they have to take it. While in the meantime they will hold on to the pay, the hours and the holidays that have been negotiated, those standards will drop drastically in future. There will be little movement on pay because the negotiating teams will no longer be equal. A management will confront a staff side which in many cases know that it will have to give in to very low pay. If managements want to cut costs, it will insist on increasing the class contact hours and the hours in the working week and will want to do away with holidays. There are all sorts of possibilities apart from simply shedding staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is worrying for those who work in FE and who have been doing a great job in the face of great difficulties for the students involved. In the light of the training and education needs of this country, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
is just about the most short-sighted move that the Government have been considering all year. They keep telling us that they want to improve the chances of British industry and that we must compete in the markets, but they are creating in our colleges the circumstances that make it more difficult to teach effectively the very people who must be trained and educated to meet those challenges as we compete with other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is already an extremely badly trained and educated country. Our standards are appalling compared with those of other industrial nations. Our children leave school earlier. Far more people in other engineering countries go on into such sectors as professional engineering. Because the Government grudge what has been achieved by the FE sector negotiating teams over these years, they think that they will save themselves a bob or two. This is the most short-sighted policy I can imagine. Not to recognise the need to hold on to those conditions and a decent level of pay for those teachers is simply to throw away chances of keeping that 5improvement going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems in FE. I do not argue that everything is perfect in FE. I worked in it for nine years and I know the problems. Sometimes teachers are not up to their job, but often the teachers' side of the negotiating teams argue that such people should be retrained or given opportunities to improve their performance. Managements often turned a blind eye to that. Sometimes colleges have poor facilities. I worked in a college building where the rain came through the roof winter after winter because there was no money to repair it properly. Sometimes staff are so mealy-mouthed they will not push problems like that. The management certainly ignore them. It is very damaging not to recognise that we are dealing here with responsible, well-trained and educated adults who want to do a good job for the students. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friends have described the problems that might occur as a result of the collapse of the SJNC. Pay and conditions in colleges will be undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speculate on a different problem. If colleges were allowed to set their own pay and standards and differences in pay and conditions arose between colleges, some people might be paid too much. It might surprise the Minister that I am worried about people being paid too much. One of the virtues of the council is that it sets a standard applicable across the various colleges, and allows the less well-off authorities to keep pace with the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In such a case, those colleges would not be able to keep pace with colleges elsewhere, and thus would not be able to attract the present quality of staff. That is a real fear, given that the purpose of setting up a network of colleges is to enable people throughout the country to have the same kind of education, to the same standard, wherever they may live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman was talking about anxieties over differentials and abilities to compete, and was unsure what proposal the Government would bring forward to replace the SJNC. It is very simple—we are putting forward no proposal whatever. It is up to the management of the colleges to determine pay and conditions. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman should be filled with alarm by that idea. Most other organisations have to operate on a competitive basis and pay what is considered appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is understandably anxious that some colleges will raise the market and others will be unable to compete. They can pay only what they can afford, which will be determined by their ability to obtain funds and their performance in terms of the number of students and the services provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objective in abolishing the SJNC is to clear the ground for more effective arrangements for negotiating the pay and conditions of service of lecturers in both education authority further education colleges and in the grant-aided colleges, which are the central institutions and the colleges of education. The existing statutory machinery has been criticised by both management and staff sides. Hon. Members will be aware that, in its response to the Bill, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities made plain its support for winding up the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not do what COSLA tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be a major revision of policy. I suppose that there is a hierarchy. At the top of it is the Educational Institute of Scotland and below that is COSLA. If the EIS does not agree with COSLA, the Opposition will do what the EIS tells them. The hon. Gentleman's comment was very revealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SJNC has existed for a relatively short time, but the circumstances pertaining when the Committee was established have changed substantially. Napier college and Glasgow College of Technology transferred to the central institution sector in 1985. There is little higher education provision in the education authority colleges and almost no provision of non-advanced further education in the central institution sector. There has been a de facto recognition by the Committee that the differences have to be reflected in different conditions of service. The last three rounds of negotiations on pay and conditions took place in separate working groups, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I take issue with the hon. Lady's conclusion. The need to establish a further negotiating tier highlights the dissimilarities between the two sectors, and the unwieldy and inefficient nature of the existing machinery. It is also to the manifest disadvantage of staff and management to devote substantial time on the Committee to detailed issues that are not of direct interest to the sector in which they work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that I said that I would understand it if the Minister were proposing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1281</span>
alternative machinery, but that I did not understand why he was proposing to abolish it. Only in the last few moments has the Minister hinted at the possibility that it would not be a permanent condition and that he might be thinking of creating alternative machinery. If he is, we shall be glad to hear about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not communicating well. We do not intend to establish any machinery. It will be left to the parties involved to decide what is appropriate. We shall move away from determining pay and conditions on a statutory basis. The vast bulk of local authority staff, whether they are chief executives, lawyers, planners, scientists, craftsmen or labourers, do not need a statutory body to determine their pay and conditions, so why on earth should we require one in this sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now been given interesting information about COSLA's view on the matter. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee which was established in 1982 in order to negotiate the pay and conditions of service of academic staff in local authority colleges, colleges of education and central institutions has, in the view of the Convention, failed to operate as an effective forum for negotiations since the immediate funding sources and the pressures facing management and staff in both sectors are different."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Minister finds fault with the present machinery, the Government can either improve the machinery or simply do away with it. When my kettle breaks down I do not say that I will do without a kettle; I get an alternative kettle. The Minister fails to explain why he thinks that doing away with the machinery is preferable to setting up machinery that will satisfy both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Lady's kettle breaks down she does not go to a statutory body which decides what she should do about it. She takes whatever action she considers appropriate. We seek to put colleges and central institutions in a position where the management and staff can, by themselves, out in the big, wide world, decide the proper basis for determining their pay and conditions. It is up to them to decide whether pay and conditions should be determined on a national basis or whether there should be local negotiations and arrangements. The Government will keep out of it completely, and there will be no statutory basis for determining their pay and conditions. There will be diversity and flexibility within the system. The hon. Lady should welcome that, as it will make consideration of those matters much easier than in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory nature of the committee has inevitably imposed constraints that would not apply where management and staff were entirely free to set up machinery that could respond flexibly to changing circumstances. Indeed, the immediate past chairman of the committee, who remains chairman of the management side, welcomed our intention to enable the staff associations and employing authorities to determine the shape and composition of the future negotiating forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1282</span>
Clause 61 preserves all existing agreements on pay and conditions of service in both sectors concerned, leaving it to management and staff together to effect such changes as they see fit. They will be able to do that within new negotiating bodies, untrammelled by statutory restrictions and designed specifically to deal with issues particular to their respective sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who, in the Minister's opinion, would have the whip hand in such negotiations: the management or the staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We associate the idea of people having whip hands with life before this 10-year period of Government. I would expect both staff and management to act in the interest of the college or institution and the students who attend it. I would not expect either side to have the attitude portrayed by the term, "whip hand". I am sorry that the hon. Lady sees industrial relations in that light. Looking around Britain today, I am encouraged to see that that kind of attitude is on the way out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are told that COSLA is in the wrong. I have cited the example of the chairman of the management side, Councillor Malcolm Green, another Strathclyde man but not a supporter of Charles Gray. We are being told that Councillor Green is in the wrong. It appears that everyone but the EIS is out of step, but we have it on authority that the EIS is composed of educated ostriches. If the hon. Lady identifies herself with the educated ostriches, she is building her house on sand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious point and I do not want to get into a schoolboy debate. When there are more teachers than jobs, the management can push for lower salaries, less holidays and worse conditions. That is logical. Anyone who knows anything about industrial relations realises that the more people there are chasing jobs, the more power lies in management hands. If, over the next few years, events turn out as I predict, which means to the detriment of further education students, will the Minister undertake to review the outcome of the Bill? The Bill will be enacted because it will be voted through with a majority of 100 even though Conservative Members of this Committee do not know what they are talking about. As that is inevitable, will the Minister review the provisions of the Bill when further education students suffer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall arrange for the hon. Lady to receive a copy of the speech, dealing with demography and future teacher supply, that I shall make to the Headteachers Association this weekend. If she thinks that there will be more teachers than jobs, she has not considered the likely direction of our policy either for schools or for higher and further education. The Government are determined to ensure wider access to higher education and more opportunities and we are already embarking on such a programme. In terms of demography in schools, the demand for teachers will increase substantially.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1283</span>
By the hon. Lady's own argument the converse applies. There will be none of the problems that she suggested but quite the contrary. She should feel enthusiastic about this clause on the basis of her own logic merely by altering the premise that she laboured with some handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background of the SJNC's imperfections, I cannot believe that tears will be shed on its demise. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Minister gives only part of the story when he quotes from a document. He only went half way in quoting from the COSLA document about whether the SJNC should be abolished. The convention believes that the SJNC should be abolished but hopes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"after negotiation with the Staff Side, arrangements can be made for the setting up of a non-statutory body for academic staff in local authority colleges."</p></blockquote>
It wants a body that will arrive at national agreements. In his reply to a written question in June 1988, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My officials stand ready to assist the various parties in devising alternative arrangements which better reflect the needs of management and staff at all levels in the two sectors."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 24 June 1988; Vol 135, c. 	<i>750.]</i></p></blockquote>
So the Secretary of State said that his officials would help staff and management to make alternative arrangements to replace the statutory provision of the SJNC. However, the staff and management disagree. The management want the SJNC to be abolished and the staff want it to be retained. I should have thought that if the Government are to play a role, it should be to find agreement between employers and staff, not to take the side of the employers alone and then only in part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful for the hon. Gentleman to know that the joint chairmen and secretaries of the staff and management in local authority further education have already had discussions about the shape of future machinery. I understand that they have made reasonable progress, and that discussions are continuing. So there is nothing about the clause that would prevent a conclusion such as the hon. Gentleman favours. There is every sign that, even as we speak, forces are at work in the market place, operating without the benefit of legislation in exactly the direction that the hon. Gentleman wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forces are always operating outside the House, reacting to whatever the Minister and his hon. Friends impose on the people of Scotland. They recognise that the SJNC will be abolished because the Government want it abolished. Therefore, it is natural that management and staff should come together to find to body to take the place of the SJNC. But that is not what the Minister said when he first spoke in this stand part debate. He said that the Government do not intend to make proposals. Employers will pay whatever they can afford. He said nothing about national agreements, but said that what the education authority can afford to pay staff would depend on its policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1284</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that subsection (3)(a) negates what the Minister has just said? It is easy to foresee local groups breaking away from any agreements that might be reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Bill refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any group of teaching staff'.</p></blockquote>
There could be an equivalent Professional Association of Teachers for the FE sector. The Minister's eyes light up with delight and he thinks, "Great. A non-striking body to support the Conservative party." He would love to see such bodies defy whatever national agreements might be reached by COSLA and the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his Back Benchers intend corporate colleges to emerge in Scotland. They do not have to listen to whatever is agreed between COSLA and the staff, but can go their own way. The Minister said that it will be up to the employers to pay whatever they can afford. If a corporate college can afford to pay its staff more, it should do so. If a corporate college cannot afford to pay more, it should pay less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wants to have it COSLA's way, the Secretary of State for Scotland's way and his own way, with a completely free market. He cannot have it three ways: he can have it only one way. Either there are national agreements that take the place of the SJNC, or there are no national agreements. I conclude from the Minister's comments that there will be no national agreements. The education authorities and their employees can get together, by all means, to try and form a body that will arrive at a national agreement for them, but they will be undermined and undercut by the freedom given to any group of teachers and any college to break away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister of the 19 institutions in England that are being looked at, to see whether they are fit to look after their own affairs. Where corporate colleges are given the freedom to make their own arrangements with their own staff, they will immediately attack the employment in the college, and attack the contracts, reducing wages and affecting working conditions. That is what the clause is about, and that is why we shall vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
