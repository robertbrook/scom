<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill</h1></div>
<p>[Continuation from column 84]</p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before we adjourned, the British people do not like bullying Governments or unreasonable conduct from those ruling over us. Earlier, the Under-Secretary claimed that the Bill was about the power for self-determination of the Scottish people, but their expressed wish for an Assembly is not being attended to with the same assiduity.<br><br>
The views of Dumfries and Galloway regional council were mentioned earlier. I shall also quote from it: "Committee Report." It states that in
<br><blockquote><p>"the first 47 clauses of the Bill … there are a minimum of 28 separate occasions when the Secretary of State for Scotland may impose, require, make conditions, order, approve, prescribe, regulate, permit, determine, direct, consent to, make notice, provide guidance or have referred to him".</p></blockquote>
It remains only for Mrs. Ayatollah in No. 10 Downing Street to issue a fetwa and the Government will have done everything possible.<br><br>
Another attempt to defend the Bill was made by referring to what happens in a butcher's queue and by saying that it was all a matter of choice. It was argued that if the butcher did not provide the meat that people wanted they could go to another butcher. But if some people buy all the steak, all that will be left for others is mince and sausages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 goes to the heart of the Bill. This has been an interesting and lively debate, and I shall pick up some of the themes that have run through it.<br><br>
In my view the most important aspect of the clause is the fact that it allows parents to free themselves from local authority control if they so wish. As I said in an intervention to the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), the great merit of the Bill is that it does not compel anybody to do anything. The honourable Member for Fife, Central told my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary that there was a dichotomy, but the honourable Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He does not want the freedom provided in the clause to be given to parents. He fears for Scottish education if the clause is implemented. He fears that the same thing will happen to Scottish education as happened 10 years ago when the Gov-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
ernment introduced a Bill to free people from local authority housing control.<br><br>
When we gave people the right to buy their council houses, we did not know how many would take that opportunity. There was no compulsion on council house tenants to buy their council houses. The freedom was given and we now know what none of us could foretell then. I have no doubt that when Opposition Members opposed that legislation they challenged the Minister to say how many people he thought would take advantage of that freedom. Obviously the Minister was unable to state a specific number, just as we do not know today how many schools will take advantage of the provisions of clause 1.<br><br>
I know that there was a great shock throughout the town halls of this land—Labour-controlled as well as Conservative-controlled—when people took the opportunity of breaking free from local authority control of their houses. The Opposition fear that the serfs will be able to break away from control of local education authorities. They know that the clause is likely to do for Scottish education the same as was done for housing by the legislation on the sale of council houses. They oppose the clause because they will lose power; power will be devolved down to parents and the people who use the service. This is real devolution— devolution of education not to an Assembly, but to the Scottish people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman made a spirited defence of choice and freedom in education. The interesting point about the argument is the reference to choice. When a school has opted out, who will exercise the choice of which children will go to that school? Will the parents or the school exercise that choice? Will the honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) address the fundamental issue of choice in Scottish education? If a town has one comprehensive school, which opts out, will the honourable Gentleman or the Under-Secretary guarantee that every child for whom that school was his first choice will be given a place after it opts out and after it takes advantage of clauses 2, 16 and 28 under which the admission criteria may be on the basis of selection?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly do that. That is the great virtue of having someone like me on the Committee. My constituency is facing those very issues at present. We are ahead of Scotland. Just down the road from me, parents in Skegness have exercised their choice to opt out of local authority control. That is spreading like wildfire in Humberside, which is controlled by a Labour local authority. That Labour authority is fearful that the freedom of choice in Skegness will spread throughout the county and up and down the land.<br><br>
In reply to the specific questions asked by the honourable Member for Fife, Central, of course there will be parental choice. When the school board has put forward its proposals, which will be accepted or rejected by the parents, I bet that no opted-out schools will want to return to local authority control. I know what will happen. Opting-out will spread like wildfire. Once one school does it and has pressure on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
numbers, and other schools find that their pupils want to move to it, pressure will be brought to bear on them to do the same and opt out of local authority control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present in Scotland, 95 per cent. of all the children who want to go to the school of their first choice can do so. Can the honourable Gentleman guarantee that opting-out will produce as many satisfied parents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The opportunity provided by the Bill— as by the Education Reform Act in England—will give more people choice in the future than have it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his intervention, the honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) spoke of the 95 per cent, of children who get into the schools of their first choice. He was referring to the fact that 95 per cent, of parents making placing requests under our parents' charter get their first choice. Has it crossed his mind that the Labour party voted against that extension of choice when we introduced it, and regarded it as divisive—as Opposition Members claim that these proposals are?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The honourable Member for Fife, Central is praying in aid the parents' charter that this Government introduced some eight or nine years ago. He is about eight or nine years behind the times. If, in eight or nine years' time he is still a Member of the House, he will welcome today's provisions. The only trouble with the honourable Gentleman and his party is that they are a decade behind. It is now official Labour party policy to sell council houses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We accept that the parents' charter is working, and providing choice. The question that I asked the honourable Member is whether opting-out will give choice to more or fewer people than the 95 per cent. who currently enjoy the benefits of the Government's legislation of some years back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my opinion, the Bill will provide more choice. It is wonderful that the honourable Gentleman leading for the official Opposition, belatedly, eight or nine years down the road, is accepting the benefits of the parents' charter that his predecessors rejected, in this Committee Room or some other, eight or nine years ago. Now we have an acceptance of the parents' charter, as we have an acceptance by the Labour party of the right to own one's home, even if it was once owned by a local authority.<br><br>
I have every confidence that although Opposition Members may vote against the clause today, they will undergo a conversion in eight years' time, as they have demonstrated today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) has shown a complete lack of understanding of Scottish education. He has, for example, suggested that the clause will do for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
Scottish education what the sale of council houses has done for Scottish housing. In Scotland, homelessness is on the increase; overcrowding is on the increase; dampness, decay and condensation are on the increase. If the honourable Gentleman suggests that what will happen in Scottish education is that a decent education for all Scottish children will be disrupted by the clause, he is right.<br><br>
The honourable Gentleman may represent a constituency in England, but he has no chance of representing one anywhere north of the border. With ideas like this, he would be driven out even by the Conservative voters in Scotland who rejected ideas like his not a decade ago, but a century ago. That is where the honourable Gentleman belongs—in the last century, which we in Scotland rejected a long time ago when we became a more civilised society than the one we see in some parts of England today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman should not give way on the subject of housing because we are debating clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow your advice, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
The only time that Conservative Members have become exercised this evening—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exercised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps not exercised, but showed some interest in whether or not my honourable Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) would give a target number of seats—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I was thinking of the forthcoming regional council elections. Our target number of schools is nil. We do not want any schools to opt out of local education authority control. We shall be campaigning for that. The target number of schools that Conservative Members wish to opt out may be 3,000, or they may want all the schools in Scotland to opt out of local education authority control. They can campaign for that and we shall campaign for our target. No one knows what will happen in the end, but the people of Scotland have a record of voting for the Opposition rather than for the ideas of Conservative Members. We shall win the argument, and the majority of schools will remain under local education authority control. We must fight for that and are prepared to do so. We are confident that our argument will be upheld in Scotland.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
There are moments when the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) shows an almost human nature. There were glimpses of some decent things in his past—I think that that was his working-class background in Dundee which came across in his earlier contribution. He was right to say that the only way in which many working-class children can escape from poverty is through the education system. He is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
right, too, that one way in which people can better themselves is when there are local neighbourhood schools with a social mix so that people from different backgrounds are educated together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always disagree with the views of the Labour party, especially in Dundee, but I have never doubted its integrity and how it arrived at such views. I trust that the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) will give me the same credit. I have arrived at my views with the same integrity as he has arrived at his. I just happen to differ, which does not make me any less human than him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not questioning the honourable Gentleman's integrity, but was saying that his views are sometimes so extreme that it is hard to believe that he is a member of the human race.<br><br>
I say to the honourable Gentleman that we can agree on such matters. He should try to understand that the only way in which such ideas can be properly realised in Scotland is through a system of comprehensive education. The Bill will disrupt that system and deprive working-class children of the opportunities that he wishes them to have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman talks the most awful nonsense. We have always had comprehensive education in Scotland. It has been the strength and cornerstone of our education system. When I was a young lad, which was many years before the honourable Gentleman was, there were secondary modern schools in England and secondary schools in Scotland and we had academies in Dundee. A bright child at the secondary school could transfer to the academy as of right. That was straightforward and comprehensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to be nice to the honourable Gentleman, but he then gives us idiocies such as we have always had comprehensive education in Scotland. That is not true. There were junior secondary and senior secondary schools in Scotland before comprehensive education was introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an opportunity to test the knowledge of Conservative Members about Scottish education. I wonder how many English Members know what is meant by the "qualy".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As no Conservative Member is leaping to his feet, it is obvious that none of them knows what the "qualy" means. Clause 1 is one of the key clauses in the Bill as it gives new duties to the Secretary of State for Scotland. It will take from regional councils duties that they have at present. Clause 1 is fundamental to the success of the Bill, which is a good reason why it should not become part of it. The Bill would be wrecked without it, so I hope that all members of the Committee who have the interests of Scottish education at heart will vote against the clause standing part of the Bill.<br><br>
Mention was made of flagship schools, as advocated by the honourable Member for Blackburn (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
Straw), as if that undermined the position of the Labour party. That is a good example of what the EIS means by the anglicisation of Scottish education. Flagship schools must be understood in the context of English education and especially of inner-city problems in England. They are a response to those problems and are remote from the realities of Scottish education.<br><br>
If Conservative Members try to transfer flagship schools from the English to the Scottish context, they are guilty of the anglicisation of Scottish education. We want nothing to do with it. I do not pretend to understand the intricacies of the English education system, but Conservative Members seem to think that the concept can easily be transferred from one context to the other; of course, that is absurd. That is why they lose votes in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend agree that the difference between the Government and the Opposition is that we believe that every comprehensive school should be a magnet school—a flagship for excellence—whereas the government believe that we should create, cream and select? Some schools will survive and some will go under. Has my honourable Friend a view on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do indeed. The fundamental argument of the Opposition is that every school should be good enough for the children who attend it and their parents. There is no question of magnet schools and sink schools, which the Minister is trying to create through the Bill. Every school must be a magnet school and one which parents want their children to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall quote some words of the honourable Member for Blackburn, who said
<br><blockquote><p>"I do want flagship schools which, with similar resources to others, have achieved great things for their pupils, so that when, in the future, people think of comprehensives they do think of an impersonal system, but of real schools, of paradigms of excellence, which can provide the best for all."</p></blockquote>
That does not chime with what the honourable Gentleman has just told the Committee about his party's policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Minister would listen to what is said in Committee. My honourable Friend the Member for Blackburn was speaking about the English experience—<i>[[Laughter.]</i> Conservative Members laugh—this is the fundamental reason why we need a Scottish Assembly, a Scottish Parliament, to deal with Scottish education.<br><br>
Our system is different. We understand it and we know that arguments that might be relevant in England are irrelevant in Scotland. That is why Scottish legislation concerning Scottish schools should be dealt with by Scottish Members of Parliament. The creatures opposite have no understanding of what Scottish education is about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman must watch his language.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin. Conservative Members have no understanding of Scottish education. That is the difference between the two sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman who is reputed to be the thinking man's Winston Churchill wishes to intervene, so I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman deny that the honourable Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) has anything useful to offer Scottish education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Blackburn has come up to Scotland on many occasions and has visited my constituency in Dundee. He has added a great deal of common sense to the debate there, but he would be the first to accept that the arguments about flagship schools in England have nothing to do with Scottish education. He would not for a moment suggest that that idea should be imported into Scottish education. Only the Minister and Conservative Back-Bench Members wish to import English ideas into Scottish education. No Labour Member is trying to do that. We believe that Scottish education has its own history and should be dealt with in that context, and that alien ideas should not be imported from England or anywhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting point. Is the honourable Gentleman saying that the problem of inner-city comprehensives that are not performing well, in the way that his honourable Friend suggested in the quotation that I read, is a problem that we do not have in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to do that, but not in an intervention because the Chairman would call me to order. Is the honourable Gentleman saying that in Scotland we have not experienced the problem of poorly performing comprehensive schools in inner cities, and that all our schools are the paradigms of excellence that his honourable Friend is seeking to achieve south of the border?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is twisting words. Of course some schools in Scotland do not perform as well as they might, but there are historical reasons why that is so. If inner-city schools in England are not performing well, it is for the English to decide how to solve the problem. The English should leave Scotland to solve its own problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman agree that many of the problems surrounding inner-city schools in Scotland stem from lack of employment opportunities, the environment and the sheer poverty of many families. If the Government were introducing legislation to tackle those problems, we should be more convinced about their concern for education.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady makes a fair point. In England, racism has a major influence on where people live and the relationships between people of different areas. That is not a great problem in Scotland, whereas in England it even affects schooling. Therefore, such problems are best dealt with by English MPs finding English solutions. Our problems are best dealt with by Scottish MPs trying to find Scottish solutions. The problems of England and Scotland are not the same. The very word, "inner-city" shows the difference. Most of our problems occur in peripheral estates, not in inner cities, because so many people have moved out of the inner cities to live in peripheral estates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the idea that we should leave the problems of Scotland to Scottish Members of Parliament. Did the honourable Gentleman or any of his honourable Friends from Scotland vote or play any part in the proceedings of the Education Reform Act 1988, which affected only England?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These matters are not contained in clause I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right, Mr. Martin. The Education Reform Act affects Scottish universities, so Scottish Members had every reason to be interested in it and vote on it. The honourable Gentleman's constituents have no interest in this Bill. Whether ir not it is enacted does not matter to his constituents, but it matters to my constituents. If the honourable Gentleman wishes to advocate a separate English Parliament in London to deal with English business, I shall support him. I just wish that he would support me in arguing for a Scottish Parliament dealing with Scottish business in Scotland and leave this place to deal with defence, foreign affairs and so on.<br><br>
The Government argue that clause I will extend choice to parents and free them from the tyranny of local authorities. Members of the Committee should try to understand that schools cannot be dealt with individually. In Dundee, there are 13 secondary schools, all of which are comprehensive. If three of those schools opt out, they do not do so in isolation, as their action has an immediate impact on the remaining 10 schools under local education authority control. I am in favour of choice, but not at the expense of others losing their choice when it comes to the sort of schools that they want.<br><br>
For example, the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland are for ever after Tayside regional council to close one of the 13 secondary schools. They say that school rolls do not justify so many schools in Dundee. The schools with the most pupils wil be those with history and traditions, such as Morgan academy and Harris academy, not because they are better schools but because they are often in better areas. People then think that they are better socially because pupils do not have to mix with kids from the peripheral housing estates.<br><br>
The reality is that opting out attracts pupils from other areas. I live in an area called Kirkton, which is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0063">Image</span>

large housing estate in Dundee. Our Labour group had to fight long and hard to get a school for the kids in Kirkton, and eventually the school was built. The number of pupils there is down to between 400 and 600, and if any of those are creamed away there will be immense pressure on the regional council to close down Kirkton secondary school because it will not be viable. Even if they do not close it down there will be pressure on them to reduce the number of courses because there will not be enough pupils to justify the range of courses that should be available in a six-year comprehensive school. The parents of children in Kirkton will be denied the choice of the school that they want in their area because of the provisions of the Bill. That is what Conservative Members do not understand. The government are not extending choice, they are withdrawing it from thousands of parents and children across Scotland by forcing this Bil through. I hope that in time they will come to realise precisely that.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
One of the issues which honourable Members and councillors come up against all the time in Scotland is that when the rolls of popular schools are nearly full the regional council operates a scheme whereby people are allocated priority for access to those schools. People who live in the area of such a school are priority group 1; parents with other children at the school are priority group 2. If that school opts out, will that system still apply? Can parents who are in priority group 2 go to Tayside regional council and tell the officials that their children should get into a particular opted-out school before others who come from a different part of the town but who have the academic ability which is laid down as the admission criterion? What would happen in those circumstances? People living in the locality could be denied access to an opted-out school simply because the school is already full using other admission criteria. The Minister must answer those questions.<br><br>
The Minister tried to argue that this was not a centralising measure but that is exactly what it is. The clause is about controlling schools in Scotland. The traditional way of controlling schools in Scotland was through political elections. One stood for election to' the regional council. All political parties did that, and at one time the Conservatives managed to gain control of the regional councils. Indeed, Tayside regional council used to be the jewel in the Conservative crown in Scotland. The honourable Member for Tayside, North will confirm that. At one time no one thought that the Tories could ever lose control of Tayside regional council, and through control of that council they controlled the schools in Dundee, Perth and Angus.<br><br>
That route to control has been closed down for the Conservatives in Scotland. They made such a mess of handling schools, trying to close them, trying to keep the rates down and underfunding them, that they have been rejected entirely by the people in the area. Now there is not one Conservative administration in all the education authorities in Scotland. That is what worries the Minister. He is worried that he has lost
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
control of the schools to the people he most hates— the Labour party and in some places independents and Nationalists. He has to establish another means of gaining control of schools in Scotland.<br><br>
This is not unique to education. The entire political process in Scotland has turned against the Conservative party, and the Conservatives must find means of getting round that. One of the ways is to argue for a unitary Parliament as they have done today whereby Tory Back Benchers have the right to impose in Scotland whatever they like. The other method is to undermine the democratic institutions which remain in Scotland, such as the regional councils, by taking away their powers. They do that with health boards, college councils and all sorts of bodies.<br><br>
The Minister said that there were three reasons why the clause was not about centralising control in the Scottish education dept. First he said that the Scottish Office would have no control over the staff. Control over the staff would remain with the board of management in the individual opted-out school. The board of management would in theory be under the control of the parents who live in that area. Similarly, he said that the Scottish Office had no control over the membership of the boards of management and that that would again lie with the local parents.<br><br>
That is precisely the point. The Minister knows that he cannot gain control through elections to regional councils but he knows that there still remain in Scotland, and probably always will, pockets of Tory support, often in defined areas associated with a school. Therefore with a combination of a Tory area and a mailing shot campaign to sell the idea of opting out, a campaign to be won by squeezing the local authority's ability to fund the schools properly, it might be possible to convince enough schools that the only way to survive is to use the mechanism in the Bill and opt out. Schools do not get real control by opting out. They get control of the things that do not matter. They may decide on uniforms and manage money which is passed to them, but they do not control the money that fundamentally decides how a school will perform. The Minister will control that money which is what he wanted to achieve. He has got the education authority out of the way and has direct control over the board of management which, in any case, reflects only a tiny minority view in an area of Scotland.<br><br>
The Minister had the effrontery to tell the Committee that the Bill is not a centralising measure as it contains no proposal to control the curriculum. Of course, he is not using the Bill to control the curriculum, but he is achieving that end by other means. He already controls the curriculum in Scotland by imposing national testing of seven and 12-year-olds in Scottish schools, so it is absolute hypocrisy and a complete outrage for him to try to con the Opposition that the Bill is designed to return control and offer wider choice to parents. The Bill is intended to destroy the comprehensive system of education that has served Scotland so well for the past 25 years. The Minister has never agreed that it was a good system even though it produced him, which is the only black mark against it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister went to Arbroath high school. Is that not a comprehensive school? Perhaps it was not in his day but it was when I taught there. I attended St. Augustine's secondary school, which was the first comprehensive school to be created in Glasgow in 1958. I am proud of having attended that school, as I have seen the benefits that are derived from a comprehensive education, and I want others from the sort of background from which I came to get them. There is a great danger that that will not be possible because of the Bill. If Conservative Members like the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the honourable Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), and other of the honourable Friends believe that Scottish education is worth fighting for, they should join us in voting against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was gratified when the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to me as the thinking man's Winston Churchill. I hope that by the end of the Committee's proceedings, in a couple of months, the Scottish newspapers will refer to me as the thinking man's Henry McLeish—who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should know that Winston Churchill was given very short shrift in Dundee and was kicked out by its voters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is odd that the honourable Gentleman should have mentioned that. Winston Churchill, who was born in 1874, was a distinguished Member of Parliament for Dundee. When he was ejected from his Manchester, North-West constituency, he joined the Cabinet in 1908 after the electors of Dundee had sent him to Parliament with a handsome majority. There was no one more English than Winston Churchill, but it seems that the electors of Dundee did not have closed minds about English politicians in those days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Irvine <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Strachey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. The honourable Member for Dundee, East surprises me because he seems to have a closed mind. He accepted that the honourable Member for Blackburn may be able to teach him something about education and, of course, he is a Socialist. I acknowledge that the honourable Gentleman does not approve of my views but does he not consider that I, too, may have something to offer? Because I had the misfortune to have been born in London and now represent a Lincolnshire constituency, is he suggesting that I have nothing to offer to the people of Scotland in regard to education? I deny that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman believe that the views of the Scottish public as a whole should be involved in decisions about Scottish education, or should those decisions merely be left to Members of Parliament?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respect the honourable Lady's view. She is a nationalist who believes in an independent Scotland and is entirely consistent. I am a Member of the Parliament of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but she believes that I should have no say in Scottish affairs. I accept her principled point of view and I understand that she does not vote on matters that appertain to England. However, I cannot respect the point of view of the honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), who last year voted on a Bill that introduced the community charge to England but claims that I should have no right to vote on this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman will not get away with that. That Bill contained clauses that affected Scotland. First, if he has forgotten that, it shows how infrequently he attended debates. Secondly, we had a strong Scottish interest in the Bill because there was always the hope that any amendments accepted to the English Bill would have resulted in changes in the Scottish legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This should be where we return to clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall read the <i>Hansard</i> report of the proceedings on that Bill, and I am sure that I shall find that the honourable Lady voted on many issues that affected England only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my honourable Friend does his research, he will find that the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) voted on an amendment in the Education Reform Bill specifically concerned with the Inner London education authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although this is an interesting subject, it is not encapsulated in clause 1. We must return to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall remain entirely in order if I quote the famous remark made by Sir Winston Churchill:
<br><blockquote><p>"The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal sharing of miseries."</p></blockquote>
It is extraordinary that the honourable Gentleman should claim that all Scottish schools are a paradigm of excellent. I cannot believe that. I do not claim to be an expert, but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should not misrepresent what I said. I said that the aim should be to make all schools a paradigm of excellence: I did not say that they were. I conceded that Scottish schools had problems, but that they were Scottish problems stemming from a historical situation, which should be dealt with in Scotland by Scots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all share that aim, but how can it be achieved if a standard of excellence is not set? That is why Conservative Members believe in the principle of choice. Giving parents a choice means that they have a chance to choose the best available and so raise the standard of all education. It does not mean leaving some schools aside and bringing up the standard of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
others; by setting a standard everything is dragged up.<br><br>
Opposition Members are floundering in the argument because they do not know how to oppose the Bill. Deep down, they are worried that parents in Scotland may be given a choice that hitherto they have been denied. Deep down, they are worried that many schools will opt out of local authority control. Despite our many hours of debate, Opposition Members have been unable to break through the dilemma. That is why the honourable Member for Fife, Central has refused to answer my question on three occasions. When he was given another opportunity to do so by my honourable Friend the Minister, he again refused.<br><br>
Opposition Members must resolve that dilemma before next Tuesday. Conservative Members know their views: we believe in giving parents choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, because I know that the Committee wants to hear the answer to the question that I put to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is such a boring question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) has confirmed what most people think. The Bill has been drafted by a Conservative Government. They must put to us their arguments on why opting-out is necessary in Scottish education. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East has capably dealt with the points made on excellence and magnet schools. We want to know the thinking behind opting-out and how many organisations and parents in Scotland want it. That is the question that Conservative Members are ducking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let the people give their answer. We are not forcing them. I should be surprised and disappointed if what the honourable Gentleman says is right and no schools opt out, and I suspect that, deep down, the honourable Gentleman would also be surprised. But I should not complain; I am not forcing parents to do anything.<br><br>
When I and other members of the Committee wrote that famous pamphlet "Save our Schools" to which the honourable Member for Fife, Central referred— he quoted epithets in the Scottish press—we were proud that it was adopted by our Government. I am proud that the first school to opt out in the United Kingdom is my Skegness grammar school.<br><br>
Nothing in our pamphlet is based on fear. We are not worried that English education authorities are dominated by the Labour party, so we have to take schools out of their control. Lincolnshire education authority has been Conservative-controlled for 60 years. We have a solid majority. I have 55 per cent, of the popular vote in my constituency; I have a majority of nearly 10,000.I am not worried about local authority control.<br><br>
I do not dislike the policies of Lincolnshire county'
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
council, but I admire the parents of Skegness grammar school for making that choice because they were proud of their school and felt that they had the means and the ability to take control. They were not against local authority officials, who are doing the best possible job, but they felt that they were adult enough to run their school. They could have taken an alternative point of view, but should they be denied that choice? I do not think so, therefore I hope that clause 1 will stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few years ago I was at a meeting addressed by Willy Brandt, the former Chancellor of Germany. He said that the Conservative party's philosophy is to promise to a majority what only a minority can obtain. That is the problem with this Bill. We have had a good, coherent education system until now, but clause 1 threatens that.<br><br>
Schools may opt out because the Government will destabilise the education system by their policy of funding schools. That is at the heart of the Bill. We are afraid that we shall lose a coherent system that has had popular support for many years in Scotland. That is at stake.<br><br>
We should have meetings in Edinburgh on the Bill. We could show honourable Members our schools. We would tell them the secret of the "qualy", to which my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Mary-hill (Mrs. Fyfe) referred. They may get to know something about Scottish education. They could not answer the first simple question because, unlike us, they have not been involved in the state school system. We have an empathy with that system because we have seen the good in it and we know what is threatened by this action. The system will be destroyed because it will be destabilised.<br><br>
It is a pity that the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) is not present because he focused on Strathclyde.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the honourable Gentleman. I have respect for his involvement in the state system as a head teacher of a denominational school. What does he think when he hears politicians say that such education is anachronistic and that education committees should close those schools? Because of his background and commitment to such schools, is he not tempted to see this legislation as enabling those schools to continue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should not discuss that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not deal with that point, but I shall just say that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Whether denominational education is anachronistic has been discussed by politicians of all parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Within the education system in Scotland. That matter is fundamental to the arguments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
about choice which the Bill will provide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister knows—I have reminded other honourable Members—that we are discussing clause 1. That matter may be dealt with later in the Bill, and I have no wish to stifle that debate. But I have a duty to ensure that clause 1 is debated and that we work within its strictures. Every member of the Committee also has that duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>; I was dismayed that the subject of abortion was brought into this debate as well. Throughout my adult life I have held my own views whatever milieu I was in. Those views will sometimes clash with the personal views of fellow politicians and will sometimes agree with the views of the other side. It depends on the policy. The Labour party policy is not antithetical to denominational schools. That was the case when I was in education and it is still the case.<br><br>
There is no democratic case for the Bill. We have been speaking about freedom of choice, but let us examine the democratic case that the Government are putting forward for opting out. An example of a 1,000-pupil school was mentioned earlier. There could be a 60 per cent, turnout of the parents there. Given two parents per child, there would be 1,200 people turning out. There could be a vote of 601 for to 599 against and that school would opt out by a simple majority. What has not been taken into consideration is the wider community. The school does not belong just to the parents whose children attend it at a particular time; it belongs to the community and it belongs every bit as much to the parents of children who are in primary seven and are about to enter that school. The feeder primary schools have an involvement in it. Therefore, the democratic argument just does not prevail. No consideration is given to the interests of the wider community or to the education authority's interests. Honourable Members have made the point that decisions made about opted-out schools will have an impact on the educational environment of the education authority.<br><br>
The anglicisation of education has been mentioned. I have never sided with that point of view. I have suggested that there was a destruction of the state education system in England, Wales and Scotland, and what I have heard from Conservative Members from English constituencies does not sway me from that view.<br><br>
We make no apology for referring to the situation in England and Wales and the Education Reform Act 1988. When I look at <i>Hansard</i> before 1987 and before the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) was elevated to the level of Parliamentry Under-Secretary of State for education, I remember that he was much involved in the debates in England and Wales. I remember one intervention when he implied that the Secretary of State for Education and Science did not have enough spine, and that he should go further on privatisation. Our interest in the system of education in England and Wales is legitimate because the Government have made it so.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one who believes in a unitary Parliament, I have no objection whatsoever to Scottish Members, including the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing)—the Scottish Nationalists' representative—playing their part in all the debates relating to England and Wales. It is absolutely right and proper that they should do so. All I am saying is that I ask the same rights with regard to Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point made was that we were supposed to associate or disassociate ourselves from what my honourable Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) said. It is legitimate for us to consider English education simply because it has been the<br><br>
Government's policy for the past five or six years to harmonise—as they see it—the system<br><br>
The Government have played strongly on the idea that the education authority is a hostile force in education. There is no doubt about that. The philosophy behind the Bill is at the core of this debate. The emphasis on the interests of the individual school at the expense of wider educational provision is anathema to us. Consumer choice and freedom are words that are bandied about, but I contend that there could be less consumer choice in many cases and less freedom for a number of individuals if this opting-out Bill was enacted.<br><br>
Overall, the Secretary of State has the whip-hand in the affair and he has it because of finance. The Under-Secretary has not satisfactorily answered the questions on that which we asked him earlier today. The finance will become from two principal sources, the main one being related to the amount that the education authority would, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, have spent on the school. That will be based on the historic expenditure of the education authority. The Secretray of State will then decide what amount fairly represents what the education authority would have spent on the provision of central services and benefits at the school.<br><br>
An education authority that is high-spending now may not be high-spending in two or three years, so boards of management will have to ask themselves what direct effect the poll tax will have on local authority budgets and what impact that will have on schools. Will the Under-Secretary say whether the grant will be given to schools on a year-by-year basis and how capital will be allocated? How will the Government provide for leaking roofs, storm damage and vandalism? The Under-Secretary referred to my education pedigree. I taught in an inner-city school in Glasgow and sometimes we would arrive in the morning and find it vandalised. We had to get on to the education authority immediately and ask it to make temporary repairs and then to provide the resources. What will happen in an opted-out school? Before the board of management makes a decision, such matters will have to be fully considered.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has provided no satisfactory answers. The measure is no more than the rigid cen-tralistaion of education, especially when central testing is taken into account. If the Under-Secretary is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
honest, he knows that opted-out schools will be grant-maintained schools English legislation defines those as schools that are not maintained by local education authorities but receive funding from the Secretary of State and are not considered to be the responsibility of local education authorities. Those three elements apply cogently to the position envisaged in Scotland. To describe opted-out schools as self-governing is a euphemism and it is politically deceitful to use that description. The matter has been dressed up and people should be told what it means.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) mentioned Highland regional council, which is pragmatic in its approach. I suggest that many other councils in Scotland have been pragmatic during the past few years because they have had to make hard choices on education. They know the value of education to the local community and have used every measure in the book to ensure that expenditure on education is high. Councils that deal with education day in and day out will have the same objections as Highland regional council.<br><br>
We demand from the Under-Secretary of State tonight details of the financing arrangements. He will invent demand if the system is implemented because it will destabilise the education system and parents will feel threatened. Parents will be against parents, schools will be against schools, and communities will be against communities. That will be the result of the new system. Although Conservative party members in Scotland say that the new system is intended to cover only a few schools, that is not so. The intention is to start the ball rolling.<br><br>
If the Under-Secretary believes that education is worthwhile, he should have visited schools and colleges, consulted people and then forged an agenda in consultation, without being aloof from the Scottish Office. The exercise that the Under-Secretary of State undertook for the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 was exemplary. He consulted parents, and 7,600 wrote and told him that they did not like the ceiling powers. But, sadly, he has crawled back into his ideological shell and we now have missives from the Scottish Office. I suggest that he should consult fully, because the Bill will destabilise local education authorities and isolate opted-out schools from each other. The specialised services that have been built up over the years—career guidance, psychology services, and so on—will no longer be at the behest of opted-out schools. As well as doing a disservice to local authorities, the Bill will do a disservice to opted-out schools and parents. It ill-behoves the Minister to introduce clause 1, to which we object strongly.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has had two bad moments today. One was the Gleneagles revelation, when he looked decidely uncomfortable. But worse was to come. The second and more significant occasion when he looked uneasy was when my honourable Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) asked how many schools he expected to opt out. My honou-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
rable Friend asked that question three times and did not receive a proper answer. I was sitting in a good position to see the honourable Gentleman's countenance and a haunted expression entered his eyes—a look of fear, such as the fear that we have been discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is perhaps the wettest of the Conservative Members who have been parchuted into the Committee from English constituencies. Will he tell me what assessment he and his honourable Friends made of the demand for opting out in Scotland? He knows from the English example that the schools that have been vulnerble to local authority problems have chosen to opt out. How many schools does he believe will use the legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady may know that a MORI poll in Scotland recently snowed that 31 per cent—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman said 69 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It showed that 31 per cent, of Scottish parents—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Will you protect me, Mr. Martin, from the fusillade?<br><br>
The poll showed that 31 per cent, of Scottish parents are in favour of the opportunity of opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But not of this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That provision is at the heart of the Bill and at the heart of clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I wish to return to the look of fear in the eyes of the honourable Member for Fife, Central.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the monkey, not the organ grinder, when that MORI poll took place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a parliamentary quiz game.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) may address his question only to the honourable Gentleman who is speaking, not to a third party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the third time I shall try to return to the haunted look in the eyes of the honourable Member for Fife, Central.

it were really the case that people in Scotland do not wish to opt out, Opposition Members can relax. But fear lurks in their hearts because the option just might catch on, and prove to be so popular as the parents' charter and the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, which they voted against.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the honourable Gentleman know that it will become popular?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall find out. Perhaps the number of people—31 per cent.—who demonstrated in the MORI poll that they favoured opting out will, when confronted with the choice, diminish. However, we will believe that it will expand. That is what Opposition Members fear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourble Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) deserves a late-night response to his diatribe which, even by the standards of the Government Benches, was exceedingly poor. The honourable Gentleman has brought a refreshing view to the Committee. He is right to suggest that, in respect of the hard Right of the Conservative party, he is a wet. He has spoken in many Standing Committees, and his views are nearly normal.<br><br>
The case for any Bill which is presented to the House must be put by the Government. We are alarmed, and there is a genuine fear among all the educational interests in Scotland, that the Bill is not what the Scots will get. There is no demand in Scotland for opting out. We fear that the Government will create a demand by the various devices to which we have referred. Scottish interests have been betrayed, which is why the Under-Secretary will not repeat the consultation exercise that was undertaken with school board ceilings. He was humiliated by the response he received to that exercise. Nevertheless, as my honourable Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) said, we have been presented by the back door with the proposal of opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman should keep his interventions brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by denying the allegations that I am a wet. I do not wish to see my nascent political career destroyed overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard a rumour that the honourable Gentleman used to be a member of the Social Democrat party. Is that false?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I used to be a member of the Labour party. That experience cured me of any desire to play a part in Left-wing politics ever gain. I reacted to it and made my way to the place in which I now find myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am definitely not a wet. I am a mainstream politician. If my speech has strayed from clause 1, Mr. Martin, it is not my fault. It is because of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
distractions in the Committee.<br><br>
Certain vested interests in Scottish education may not want the opting-out proposals. I have no doubt that the education authorities do not want there to be opting out. There is always an element in an educational establishment that is against change. They are against change in the legal and medical professions. But sometimes change is necessary, and it is among the parents—the consumers of education—that enthusiasm for change is likely to be found.<br><br>
We believe that the real reason for the Opposition's horror and fear is their knowledge that we might be right and they might be wrong, and that the Bill might lead to opting out on a far wider scale than many people expect. It does not stop there. It is not just a question of some schools opting out, but the effect that the ability to opt out will have on schools. I have no doubt that the fact that schools can opt out will tone up the performance of education authorities right across Scotland. The authorities will not want to lose schools. If parents have the right to opt out, education authorities will realise that they must be more responsive than they have been, and will be more likely to take account of parents' wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the honourable Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I have given away a lot—<i>[Laughter.]</i> I have given with a generosity that has astounded the Committee, myself included. I shall not give way on this occasion, because I am close to my concluding remarks.<br><br>
The ability of schools to opt out will mean that education authorities across Scotland will have to be more responsive to parents if they do not want to lose their schools. That will benefit Scottish children and parents.<br><br>
Clause 1, which is at the heart of the Bill, is entirely beneficial to the Scottish traditions of education. I shall vote for the clause with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to follow the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine). I had the feeling during his speech that he watched "The Steamie" over the Christmas holiday. This Committee may be the honourable Gentleman's steamie, because at the end of it, he may end up flat, slightly damp and heading for dry. However, I recognise that he will listen to the debates with more enthusiasm than some of his colleagues. I hope that he will listen and try to understand why his definition of "choice" is different from ours.<br><br>
It is no surprise that the most interesting debate of the day has been on clause stand part. In many ways, clause 1 goes to the heart of the Bill and the ideology which is contained therein. I should not be so worried about the Bill if I felt that there was a real attempt to deal with the issues currently facing Scottish education. It is not enough for us to joke and have a few laughs in the course of our hard work without tackling the fundamental issues which the honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) mentioned in his speech.<br><br>

As someone who has been trained in Scotland as a registered teacher with specialist qualifications in remedial education, I am concerned about standards All of us must strive for better standards in the education system. Cheap remarks about flagship schools have implications for what young people can achieve at the end of their education and what we as their legislators can offer them. We must also consider change in education. We in the Opposition recognise that society changes even though the Prime Minister says that there is no such thing as society. The way in which the education system was run 50 or 60 years ago cannot meet the demands placed upon it as we approach the 21st century.<br><br>
10 pm<br><br>
We must concern ourselves with the funding of our education system because the level of investment has important repercussions for future generations. The seed corn of our society is in young people and investment. It is not just a matter of the individual or society, but of how the two are combined in the education process to ensure that the individual realises his or her full potential and that society realises its potential. We are talking about the common weal of the future of Scotland, which will be part of the European Community, like England and Wales. I do not want to hear silly, nasty points bandied back and forth across the Committee, because what affects Scottish education will also affect the rest of the United Kingdom, the European Community and the wider world.<br><br>
A great deal has been said about the issue of choice, but the Committee has not considered what it means. Does it mean choice for the individual, a small community, a region, a nation or something greater? We should treat the word "choice with respect. If the Committee does not respect the fact that it means different things to different people, we might as well pack up and go home.<br><br>
When we discussed choice earlier, the Inner London education authority was mentioned. Who are we to say that those who voted 19 to one in favour of the retention of ILEA should have had their wishes rejected? I do not know enough about such issues, but there is a democratic choice in society. People cast their votes and hope that they will be recognised.<br><br>
As individual Members of Parliament, we have a responsibility to analyse issues and respond to demands placed upon us. I am the only member of the Committee to represent a constituency from Grampian regional council. The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber mentioned what Highland regional council said. I wish to read out a couple of remarks from Grampian regional council's education committee's report, which was forwarded to me by its chief executive. The report on choice was drawn up in response to the paper published by the Scottish Education Department in December last year. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The first three paragraphs would appear to have been prepared by a PR consultant. Many of the so called freedoms which are developed in these paragraphs relate to restrictions certainly non-existent in Grampian Region and probably in other parts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
of Scotland. 'Self-Governing schools would be free to develop distinctive approaches in aspects of curricular provision, in teaching methods and in the general ethos of the school'. Grampian schools would appear to have freedoms of this nature at the moment and these would be extended if proposals to give more financial autonomy to Head Teachers were to be developed."</p></blockquote>
That makes the clear point that choice often relates to funding and finance. The quotation on self-governing schools comes from the Scottish Office paper.<br><br>
All of us want handicapped children to be part of the normal state education system so that individuals do not feel rejected. The Scottish Spina Bifida Association commented on the Scottish Office paper, saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"What will happen if this ethos and curriculum are at variance with the needs of a handicapped child? Must parents of such handicapped children have to seek out a school, the ethos and curriculum of which are more suitable? What is such a school does not exist in the area?"</p></blockquote>
The Bill tries to deal with that in a clause on the special problems of handicapped children. But it must also deal with the involvement of handicapped children in the general education system available to them in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady has been greatly involved in special education needs in the past. Does she think that any measure in the Bill will promote special education needs in an opted-out school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced about that. The Minister gave no response on Second Reading. I am deeply anxious that the Bill should include a special reference to the needs of handicapped children so that they can be part of the general education system in the community.<br><br>
In the discussion on choice, honourable Members spoke of parent participation in the decisions that affect their schools. Having been a teacher and administrator in the education system, I know that all teachers and schools want parents to participate. However, there is a danger that clause 1 and the rest of the Bill will scare away parents from participating because they might feel that they are being asked to take on powers that go far beyond what they regard as normal parent involvement and to take on responsibilities that should be the territory of professionals. That danger is inherent in the Bill. Given the definition of the board of governors, many parents might be scared away from that.<br><br>
Reference has been made to rural schools. I represented a rural area and come from a rural background. I attended one of the local neighbourhood comprehensive schools where, if one was good at English, one was in the top stream and if one needed special help with a subject a transfer was automatic. Nobody thought anything about that. There was no particular difficulty. The context of rural areas is different from that of inner-city areas. Internal transfers in the school system always existed and children were stretched to full potential. They might have missed out on the niceties of a public school, but they were all stretched in the basics of education.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
Grampian region feels that choice is being limited on this issue. It says that the relevant sentence in the Scottish Office paper.
<br><blockquote><p>"begs the question as to whether or not the spurious choice exists. One immediate point which should be made is that the question of choice will exist only within urban areas for primary schools and large urban conurbations for secondary schools."</p></blockquote>
We must consider that matter. Like the honourable Member for Dumbarton, I spent a considerable time in the conurbations and undertook my teacher training in Drumchapel, Maryhill and Easterhouse at a time when there was such an acute shortage of teachers that we trainee teachers often found ourselves in charge of depts. I wonder what choice there will be in our conurbations.<br><br>
I referred to the problems in our inner cities and to the environmental, employment, social and economic issues that must be considered when we discuss the Bill. Unless we consider those matters we cannot talk about genuine choice for many people in our inner cities. The Under-Secretary of State will want to examine that carefully.<br><br>
I am conscious of the time, but I must remind Conservative Members that the reason why the Scottish National party has taken a strong stance is that we have distinctive views. We do not see them as being automatically better than anyone else's. We want to listen to what others have to say about education and to take examples when they are good and offer our expertise. I believe that the broad base of our education system over the years should be examined earnestly. The idea of Highers, O-grades and the distinctive nature of our system is much more in line with the European Community than that south of the border. When we talk about anglicisation, we do not mean to be derogative towards English people. We believe that much of what we have is extremely good and we wish to retain it. We do not want it to be overtaken by ideas that will diminish our system.<br><br>
If positive ideas are offered, the education circles in Scotland will most certainly listen, but we must not be forced to accept an alien system against the wishes of the education establishment and the Scottish people. We should be considered in the context of the late 20th century, moving into the 21st century. We want to be part of an international community and we have a sound base on which to build. The Bill contains serious disadvantages for a community that wishes to participate in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the son of a Scottish border farmer's daughter, I am delighted to be participating in the Committee. I am sorry that I was not here on Tuesday, although I gather that I did not miss much.<br><br>
I am especially looking forward to the contributions of the honourable Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) as her accent contributes so much to the rich diversity that we offer in the United Kingdom. With my ear on linguistics, I look forward to studying the honourable Lady's interesting and rich language.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I engage in the same amusement and enjoyment of the honourable Gentleman's accent. A moment ago, I was wondering what a "bodah fahma's dota" was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the honourable Lady is as interested in my accent. We shall obviously get along well. I hope that by the end of the Committee's proceedings, we shall have reached an understanding of one another that will be in the interests of harmony between two great nations.<br><br>
Our debate on clause stand part as identified the substantial philosophical differences between the Conservatives and the Opposition. The honourable Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), who I am sorry to see is not in his place at present, asked about our thinking behind opting-out. He does not seem to understand what we are driving at; that illustrates the gulf between us.<br><br>
I shall try to answer the honourable Gentleman's question about the purpose of the Bill. We believe that the present system offers an imposed uniformity that is entirely in keeping with Socialist philosophy. It is a legitimate philosophy, but not one that we share. We believe that those who are wealthy can exercise choice, and do not need looking after; they can make their own decisions and have the means for carrying them out. We are concerned with the small people— as my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) said—who are trapped at present and have no alternative to a system which those who deem themselves better than parents feel should be dished out to them.<br><br>
10.15 pm<br><br>
My honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) spoke of vested interests and of the people who will resist the Bill because they represent certain interests. He spoke of local authorities. Clearly, any local authority that see a school slipping away from it will not like it, because the authority, and the officials who run the education department, will feel that somehow it has failed, and that the schools that have opted out have passed judgment on the capacity of officials to provide the education that people want.<br><br>
In a sense, that is right. The fact that schools are already looking to opt out is a sign that they are not satisfied that the monolithic local authority education system is providing what parents want.<br><br>
Anxiety has been expressed that some members of the Committee represent English constituencies. There are those who say that the Bill is no business of ours. The unitary argument has already been deployed by my honourable Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), but he might have included Northern Ireland. I believe that the Ulster Unionists could do their cause a great deal of good if they participated in events in this country and did not limit themselves to those of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I believe that honourable Members from various parts of the kingdom are legitimately entitled to parti-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
cipate in the debate because no one is imposing anything upon the people of Scotland. The Bill is a permissive, not a mandatory, measure. If parents feel overawed by the responsibilities that the measure would confer upon them, they have a simple option. They do not need to opt out.<br><br>
As the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said, the clause goes to the heart of the Bill. The Bill is a permissive measure; it is not an anglicisa-tion. It gives the people of Scotland a further opportunity to decide for themselves whether they would prefer a different, and perhaps a better, way.<br><br>
Last year we heard many arguments about the community charge being introduced in Scotland first; it was said that Scotland was being used as a guinea pig and that England and Wales would follow. This is an example of where England and Wales have gone first, with the opportunity to opt out. Scotland cannot accuse us of having imposed something on it that has not already been offered to other parts of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Even before the Bill came into Commitee, it concentrated people's minds. Mr. Forrester, the organising secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, has been quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"In general, there should be greatest possible sensitivity to local parental opinion, even if this seems perverse when viewed from the education offices or the regional chambers."</p></blockquote>
There we have it. Even before we get beyond clause 1, someone has recognised that education must be more responsive to the needs of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit like competitive tendering. When a council sees on the horizon the possibility of a privatised service, it is amazing how the in-house service pulls up its socks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely good example. Competitive tendering has been one of the great success stories throughout the United Kingdom, with substantial benefits for ratepayers. My memory fails me on who was the author of the concept of competitive tendering, but I know that one of my honourable Friends did a marvellous job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman agree that in the competitive tendering that took place in the 1987 general election, 62 Opposition Members were returned in Scotland? Does the honourable Gentleman believe, therefore, that his Government have a mandate to operate in Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a hoary old chestnut from the honourable Lady. She knows perfectly well that Labour Governments relied heavily on the Scottish vote to impose upon England and Wales. We did not complain then, because we have a unitary Parliament. I respect the purity of the honourable Lady's principles in such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall complain if we do not return to clause 1.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr Martin. I did not realise that I had strayed from clause 1. Opting-out is already being offered to parents in England and Wales. The experience to date is most interesting.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), who is not here at the moment, mentioned that the measure does not take into account the community and that it would suffer if a school chose to be self-governing. He said that the parents at the opted-out school might be fine, but that others in the community might face difficulties.<br><br>
A school in Birmingham carefully considered opting out and wishes to proceed. The headmaster of that school said:
<br><blockquote><p>"What we are talking about is parent power. People round here no longer see this place as an institution but as their school. They are excited. They want to know what they can do next."</p></blockquote>
That is the point. People now see the school as part of their community, which they did not when the school was in the hands of the local bureaucrats over whom they had precious little control. The headmaster concluded by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is good for the school, good the the image of the area, good for the self-esteem of the children."</p></blockquote>
We rest our case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Time is getting on, so I shall be brief and avoid giving, as other members of the Committee have done, a short biography of my mother, father, brothers and sisters, and which school I went to. I am probably one of the few members of the Committee who sat the "qualy", and I only just passed it. [Honourable Members: "What's that?"] The "qualy" was the 11-plus examination. That was today's classwork. For homework, perhaps honourable Members will write an essay on "lowers" and hand it in at the next sitting.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) was right about the relationship of Scottish education to English education. We are biased and may consider that Scottish education is better, but the important point is that it is different in order to reflect the different history, social structure and geography of Scotland. We do not think that everything in England is bad or that it is all good. We also do not consider, as the under-Secretary seems to, that everything in Scotland is bad.<br><br>
I was disappointed by most Conservative Members' speeches, especially after this morning's fine debate. Honourable Member's behaviour was patronising, superficial, jape-like, hypertrophic and schoolboyish. But the speech by the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) was not like the others. It was revealing. The Opposition have constantly asked about the basis of the Bill and why it contains provisions for opting out. The honourable Member for Eastwood revealed the reasons. In his speech, he said nothing about standards and how they would be improved. He did not say what the standards would be and describe the methods—X, Y and Z—that would achieve them. Instead, all he spoke about was Paisley
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
grammar school, Our Lady and St. Francis and Notre Dame schools. His remarks contained incredible vile and venom that is unusual for him. The Bill has nothing to do with educational standards. It is designed to prevent the closure of a few, select, schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the honourable Gentleman will listen with interest to my speeches on later clauses and on educational standards. I wanted to be relatively brief. What is the honourable Gentleman's stance on Our Lady and St. Frncis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the honourable Gentleman to reply to that. Will he direct his remarks to clause 1?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a great pity. I was willing to answer the question.<br><br>
It is interesting that the honourable Member for Eastwood did not attempt to justify the basis for the Bill. Once again, he returned to those schools because he cannot justify the Bill on any other grounds. It is also significant that he kept on about parents, parents, parents. He never once mentioned children. The honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) also concentrated on parents as though education is solely about them and has nothing to do with children or standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman not recognise that we, as parents, feel that we have a better understanding of what is good for our children than some education specialists? We do not believe that education specialists know all the answers. When we discuss the role of parents, we implicity refer to children. Education specialists tend to ignore children because they think in their own terms and of their own profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the honourable Gentleman's point, but it is revealing that when Conservative Members talk about education, they virtually never talk about children. That signifies an important difference between us. For the Opposition, education is about improving standards and realising the potential of children. Parents are important, but they are not the prime concern of education. I hope that the Committee will spend more time discussing children.<br><br>
The remarks of the honourable Member for Eastwood on single-sex schools relate to choice. I come from Partick. For the benefit of some Conservative Members it is a place in Glasgow and not a man's name. Notre Dame school is in Partick, and one of my neighbours wanted to send his two sons there because it is their local school. He cannot do that because it is a single-sex school. He therefore had to send his sons to a school that is further away, and which is basically a boy's school. My neighbour wanted to send his sons to a local, mixed school, but he was unaable to do that. His ability to choose was removed.<br><br>
Some people may wish to send children to single-sex schools. I am not against that. However, choices in society have to be balanced. I do not disagree that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
that can be difficult, but the democratic process is used to make such decisions. A few parents should not be allowed to remove choice from my neighbour. He has a choice, too. The best way in which to balance them is through democratically-elected representatives on the local authority. If voters are unhappy with their local education authority. If voters are unhappy with their local education authority, they can vote it out at the next election and put themselves forward. That is known as democracy.<br><br>
Conservative Members do not like democracy. When they lose in Scotland under a democratic process, they try to circumvent the system. If parents are unhappy with the education system they should not vote for those responsible for it. That means that they should not vote for the Labour party in Scotland.<br><br>
Choice is not just a simple buzz word—many factors must be taken into account. When I have asked parents in my constituency whether they want choice or the best possible education available in the school nearby, they reply that they want the best possible education in their nearby school, that question should be asked in the Ministers surveys.<br><br>
Choice is used as a secondary mechanism for so-called achieving higher education standards. The Minister and others have said that they want all schools to be great and that all schools will be dragged up through the mechanism of choice, but once there is choice, there are differentials. There will be good schools and bad schools, and winners and losers.</span></p>
<p>10.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the honourable Gentleman's interesting theory. If no one has any choice and parents want the best possible education for their children, how will those parents know that their children are receiving the best possible education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has the best possible education by setting standards based on the best available and always striving to better it. That is the difference. the prime motive among Opposition Members is to achieve the best possible education. The Minister proposes a false choice and differentials, whereby not everyone will get the best. By some epiphenomenon education is supposed to improve.<br><br>
Malcolm Green and Fred Forrester have been mentioned this evening. There has also been a great deal of talk about making everything so good, as if there were something wrong with saying that we should try to achieve the best and that the best way to fight the Bill is to make everything as good as possible. We have been trying to do that for years. We are simply continuing. If we continue in that way, there will be no great problems.<br><br>
There has also been talk of centres of excellence. We want every school to be a centre of excellence— not of elitism, which is what Conservative Members propose. We do not want centres of elitism in seas of despair. I recounted earlier the experience of my neighbour: a school cannot be isolated within its community.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
Conservative Members claim that self-governing schools will break free. That implies that those left behind are weak, pathetic and hopeless. That reflects the Conservative attitude—only the great and the good can break free—but they will break free from the local education authority and fall straight into the hands of the Scottish Office.<br><br>
The Bill has many reserve powers—clauses 31 and 25(7) give the Secretary of State draconian powers. Opting-out schools will not be self-governing but self-administrating and the Minister should be honest and call them that. The Secretaty of State will retain financial power over them and they will merely be self-administrating schools.<br><br>
I want to deal with the hoary old chesnut of the number of schools that may opt out. I shall not go over all the arguments again. But is the Minister asking us to believe that, before introducing the legislation, he never discussed with anyone in the Scottish Office whether some schools might opt out? Does the Minister have any views on that? Is he honestly saying that he introduced a Bill on which so much parliamentary time will be spent without considering the possibility that no school will opt out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, and, while we watch the white spot disappear on the annunciator screen, I shall try to deal with some of the arguments of Opposition Members. I was slightly puzzled by the remarks of the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) about his friend from Partick who wanted to send his sons to Notre Dame and felt that his choice was restricted. I understand that Notre Dame has been a girls' school since its inception. It has a proud tradition and has been oversubscribed because of the parents' charter. Parents have opted to send their children to Notre Dame. Its pupils come from all types of backgrounds and different parts of the city of Glasgow. Despite the fact that it was a popular school, there were plans to close it.<br><br>
My honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) referred to Notre Dame, Paisley grammar and other schools. The honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was right when he said that the Bill was connected with events at those schools. Such events are symbols of the sort of thinking that is part and parcel of our argument. There is a need to break the monopoly of local authorities, to provide for choice.<br><br>
Were it not for the fact that we had passed secondary legislation, against which Opposition Members voted, the Secretary of State would not have had the power to save Paisley grammar and Notre Dame from closure. Those highly successful schools provided a distinctive form of education and were extremely popular with parents, yet the Labour party wished to close them. Will Labour Members say why that decision was made? My version of events is that they disliked what the schools stood for.<br><br>
As for Paisley grammar, the facts are revealing. Mr. Alex Wood, the former Labour leader of Edinburgh

district council and a former pupil of that school, having benefited from the Scottish education system, wished to pull up the ladder behind him. In a letter to <i>The Scotsman,</i> he said that the Strathclyde local authority was right to close the school. He listed the school's offences: it had a Latin motto; it played rugby instead of soccer; it had a snob value; and it was an elitist institution, which placed too much emphasis on academic matters.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) may laugh, but there were enough politicians on the education committee of Strathclyde authority who were willing to close that successful school. The Bill will remove the right of small groups of councillors on education committees to override the wishes, not of central Government, but of parents. The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) argues that if people do not like certain decisions, they can vote those responsible for them out of office. She must recognise that the Bill will extend democratic forces to parents; it provides for devolution. I realise that that word is not as attractive to us as it is to Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a wonderful word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are prepared to put that word into practice only when setting up committees of politicians who take decisions on behalf of the public, including parents. My honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood was right to focus his remarks on such examples.<br><br>
You pulled me up, Mr. Martin, when the honourable Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) was in the Committee earlier. I am sorry if I caused him any offence. But Malcolm Green, the convenor of the education committee, said that single-sex schools were an anachronism and that it was right to close schools such as Notre Dame. Who is Malcom Green to decide?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An elected representative.</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is the people's commissar. He says that single-sex education is an anachronism, and the many thousands of parents who want single-sex education for their children lose that choice. That system is indefensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the honourable Lady in a moment. I know of her interest: she speaks on women's issues. She made the point that none of us knows what it is like to be at a girls' school. We all agree with that. But were it not for the Conservative Government, people would not be able to send their children to a girls' school such as Notre Dame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How do ordinary parents exercise the choice to send their children to schools such as Rugby, Haileybury and other famous public schools that Conservative Members have attended? Would the pa-

rents of the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) have got into such schools? They would have been told to get lost, and well the Minister knows it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have been rude about some of my honourable Friends. My honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Irvine) has been dubbed a wet and a moderate. He is the only one of us who went to such a public school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I went to a secondary modern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It shows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am wrong, my honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich is not the only one. My right honourable Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) also went to such a school and Opposition Members feel that he has taken a brave stand on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I distinctly heard the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) say "It shows," whenl said that I went to a secondary modern school, having failed the 11-plus. I was proud of the education that I received from that school. It got me to York university and then into the House. The headmaster of my school was proud of its achievements. The honourable Gentleman should withdraw that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Honourable Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a little progress and then give way? I want to deal with some of the points raised.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said that there was too much talk about parents and not enough about children. The education debate in Scotland used to be about teachers, classrooms and resources, but now it is about what is achieved in schools. When we talk about parents, we are talking about children. Parents are responsible for their children and best able to make decisions about their children's education and future. They reject the view that education professionals are better able to take those decisions and the notion that only middle-class parents are able to make such judgments.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) implied that the Bill attacks the traditions of Scottish education. I cannot think how. The Scottish education system gives children, regardless of their background, access to the highest possible quality of education. People can use the education system as a ladder of opportunity. That reputation was achieved partly by the old grant-aided schools, which were wiped out by the Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were wiped out.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Give us the evidence for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the honourable Gentleman's Government who withdrew the grant from the grant-aided schools and who attacked them on the basis of the privileged education which they provided. The fact is that those schools provided an opportunity—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For how many?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady asks for how many. Those schools provided an opportunity for children from all kinds of backgrounds to get access to the best quality education and they were destroyed. Destroyed is not exactly the right term: the majority of them became independent schools. They still exist and provide a high quality of education. The difference is that now access is limited to those with money and the ability to pay. The honourable Lady asks how many went to Rugby. Many Conservative Members came up through that system. We benefited from that system and we wish to see that choice and that opportunity extended to those who are denied it at present.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
The honourable Member for Moray claims to speak for Scotland and Scottish traditions. Dundee high school was one of those schools. It offered people in Dundee a type of education—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A small minority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it could not cope with the whole of Dundee. It had a physical capacity. But this year it celebrates its 750th anniversary. It was accessible to all until we had a Labour Government. The Bill creates an opportunity for schools which provide a specialist education or a type of education which parents want, and which are different from the grant-aided schools in the sense that the education will be free, to come back into the Scottish education system as part of that tradition. I am surprised that the honourable Lady, in arguing for the Scottish tradition, should not see that and should not support the clause. If she needs a totem pole for her party she might bear in mind that one of the founding pupils of Dundee high school was William Wallace, a hero whom her party is keen to bring to the fore. He fought the battle of Stirling bridge which is why I feel a particular affection for him myself—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hope that the honourable Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden can find a better candidate than he has on the previous two occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are working on that; do not worry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of the honourable Gentleman's acknowledgement of the problem.<br><br>
The honourable Lady also asked me about rural schools. Rural schools will be able to adopt self-governing status if they wish. That will not diminish choice. The schools will still be there and parents will still have a right to send their children there under the parents' charter. All self-governing schools will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
covered by the parents's charter and it will operate in exactly the same way as it operates elsewhere. The honourable Lady said that choice means different things to different people. That is certainly true, but her solution to that problem seems to be to ensure that no one can have anything except what everyone else has. That is not a solution. We seek diversity so that people may exercise that choice.<br><br>
I agree that some people might prefer denominational schools. Others might prefer non-denominational schools. However, just as there are people in the Labour party, and doubtless in the Conservative party, too, who are against single-sex schools so there are people who are against denominational education. I happen to support denominational education, not because of my religion but becuse what has been achieved in many of the denominational schools in Scotland in terms of standards and ethos goes a long way towards our broader objective. But some members of the Labour party are opposed to denominational education as a matter of principle. If we had a system where education committees could decide at a stroke to cut out schools because they did not like what they stood for, people's choice would be diminished. I should have thought that the honourable Member would support clause 1 as it provides a lifeboat, if nothing else, for the extension of choice.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Moray asked about special needs. Children with special needs will not suffer from these provisions. On the contrary, the Bill goes to considerable lengths to protect their position. Provision for special education needs is one of a school's basic characteristics, which must be preserved when the school becomes self-governing. Such provision can be changed only by the complex and public process laid down in clause 28. For all the fuss that there has been about it, changing the basic characteristics of a school will require the support of parents and the approval of the Secretary of State. At present, any school in the local authority sector requires only the consent of the education committee and the local authority to make a fundamental change. So there is additional protection in the Bill.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Dundee, East asked whether everyone could be admitted to self-governing schools. The parents' charter gives that guarantee. If a school is oversubscribed, there will have to be a form of admission which will be set out in the school's scheme of government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is to be set out in the school's scheme of government, will the Minister give a commitment that that procedure will mirror exactly the procedure that is used by the local education authority to guarantee people access under the parents' charter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a guarantee about the procedure for admissions, which will be approved by the Secretary of State. The parents' charter will operate. If the school is oversubscribed, the scheme of government must provide for children from the immediate neighbourhood of the school to be given priori-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
ty. It will be for the school that wants self-governing status to gain the support of the parents for its scheme of government, and for the Secretary of State to approve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing new in that point. We have been make it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister can give a cast-iron guarantee that any school which opts out will still give priority to the kids who live in its immediate neighbourhood, that makes nonsense of the provisions in the Bill which will allow a school to change its admissions policy to reflect the academic ability of those children. Doing that would, by definition, exclude some of the kids in the school's immediate neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is so consumed by his hostility to the Bill that he cannot bring himself to think the argument through. Parents will have a right to send their child to a self-governing school if places are available, regardless of where the child comes from. If the school is oversubscribed, there has to be an admissions policy. That would give priority to people from the immediate neighbourhood, which is particularly important in rural areas. The honourable Gentleman believes that that conflicts with the provisions in clause 28 which cover selection and changing the characteristics of a school.<br><br>
I do not know whether the honourable Gentleman went to his own party conference. I watched part of it on television. The honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made a great point about what I said on Second Reading about the Hungarians—I shall not get diverted to that subject now—and also about Knightswood school. He even followed it up with an article in one of the Sunday newspapers. Knightswood is a comprehensive school in the constituency of the honourable Member for Garscadden, and it has a good school of dance. Entry is selective—the school takes only children who will excell and are interested in dancing—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Will the honourable Member for Dundee, East listen to the argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting to the point. Knightswood has a school of dance. Let us suppose that a school which becomes self-governing wants to set up a school of dance like the one at Knightswood <i>[Interruption.]</i> The honourable Member for Dundee, East laughs. Labour Members cannot conceive that some Conservative Members do not believe that only those who can afford to pay twice should have access to specialist education and that the state system should not have schools that specialise in music, dance, mathematics or other areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am answering the question if the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
honourable Gentleman will listen.<br><br>
A self-governing school may wish to specialise in dance, music or the arts. Pupils wishing to attend the school for that purpose would have to be selected according to ability. If there were no provision in the Bill to allow schools to change their characteristics in some way, how could they achieve what Knightswood has already achieved within the Strathclyde education authority with the Labour party's support?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. The Minister seems to be arguing that the provision within the Bill, which would allow schools to have an admissions policy to reflect academic ability, relates only to specialist education and that no school could become selective across the gamut of subjects provided. Is he saying that schools would not be allowed to return to the old senior secondary model or the grammar school model? Does the provision apply only to specialist subjects such as dance or music?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that it was crystal clear, from what I have just said and from what my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading. My right honourable and learned Friend said that he would not consent to the introduction of general academic selection, and in the wind-up speech on Second Reading I mentioned Knightswood. The point that I made was turned round and used by the honourable Member for Glasgow, Garscadden, who said that I did not understand the difference between selection for a specialist provision of the kind at Knightswood and general academic selection. It is not me who does not understand the difference but Labour Members. They do not understand the need to allow schools to alter their characteristics to reflect parents' interests.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Johnston), who, alas, is no longer here, asked about financial freedom and capital allocations to self-governing schools. I have already said how schools will be funded in terms of their education authority—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the Minister has not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman says that I have not. If he wants me to go over it again I shall do so. They will be funded on the same basis as though they have remained part of the education authority.<br><br>
Capital allocations will be determined on the same basis as we give consent to education authorities to allocate capital to their existing schools. My right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State will need to consider priorities.<br><br>
Labour Members have spent the entire day telling us how interested they are in such details, but their behaviour shows that they are not. Throughout the day and in the run-up to our sittings we have seen a battle as to which is the most macho Opposition party in Scotland—[Honourable Members: "Oh!"]—I was thinking of the colleague of the honourable Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who can no longer attend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
meetings in the House.<br><br>
I return to the point on flagship schools. The purpose of the clause is to create the emergence of schools that reflect parents' wishes. I am wholly at one with the honourable Member for Blackburn on the issue of flagship schools. I agree that we should celebrate those schools. My honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) mentioned Our Lady and St Francis. That is a good example of a school that has achieved much despite limited resources and various problems. The Bill as a whole and clause 1 in particular will provide that opportunity.<br><br>
It is depressing that the Labour party in Scotland is not at one with the honourable Member for Blackburn but argues that this question is not relevant to Scotland. The honourable Member for Dumbarton holds his hand back. Why does he not ask Strathclyde education authority for a copy of the survey of performance in Glasgow schools, which it refuses to publish because the information is so damning? He should examine the report and come back to the Committee to tell us what it says. I wonder if he will then say that there is no need or a policy to create self-governing schools in Scotland. I am sure that Strathclyde education authority will show him the report. Let him then in all conscience say that there is no problem in Scottish education and inner-city areas. The Bill will tackle that problem. Strathclyde education authority does not even have the courage to publish its reports.</span></p>
<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall come back to that point later. I have been reading the report on Strathclyde regional council compiled by Her Majesty's Inspectorate, which is the Minister's organ for assessing schools. The Government auditors produced a very good report on Strathclyde, which can hold its head up with regard to the quality of its school provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman should take my advice and investigate the Centre for Educational Sociology, which the honourable Member for Fife, Central holds in high regard. I do not entirely share his enthusiasm for its work. The honourable Member for Dumbarton should read the CES paper based on the 1981 national school leavers survey of schools in Glasgow. Three of the researcher's findings are of immediate relevance to our debate. The first showed that
<br><blockquote><p>"Glasgow Division schools obtained results significantly below those of the other divisions in Strathclyde".</p></blockquote>
A statement on page 28 is particularly striking:
<br><blockquote><p>" 'We can conclude that the "average" … Glasgow pupil obtained no A—C awards, ie, for a composite year group covering three S4 cohorts' … 'Glasgow's below average performance is not wholly explained by the character of the pupil intake, as measured by the social class indicator'… 'The performance of Glasgow pupils is below average within each social class group', ie, 'in most instances Glasgow pupils from each social class group performed less well than pupils from the comparable group in the rest of the region'."</p></blockquote>
I do not agree with Andrew McPherson who believes that social class determines children's ability to per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V008P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
form in school. I entirely reject that view. Even the evidence cited by the Opposition as proof of the success of comprehensivisation shows that there is a performance problem in Glasgow.<br><br>
I must defend my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood who said that it is remarkable that when faced with the problem of school closures, Strathclyde chooses to close the most successful schools in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in Glasgow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our Lady and St Francis is in the east end of Glasgow. Notre Dame is also in Glasgow and they are two of the most successful schools in Strathclyde. Some of us suspect that Strathclyde closed the popular, successful schools to ensure that everyone receives the same level of education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not involved in Strathclyde regional council, but I do not doubt that it has had major problems with which it has dealt not too successfully over the years. But the Minister is taking his arguments to an illogical conclusion and would be better advised to discuss the other issues that affect the educational opportunities of young people in Glasgow. Having trained there, I am conscious of the major difficulties that exist. Some are sociological, some economic and some involve the schools themselves. Those must be dealt with. The Minister's speech is not leading towards a real discussion on education this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Lady would not be too pleased if I were to make the type of speech that she encourages me to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall start on Tuesday then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we shall come back to this matter. I urge the Committee to support the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has lost it on his argu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
ments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very touching. I want the Committee to support the clause so that those who argue that they are best able to make decisions on behalf of parents— and who have not been too successful so far—are subject to some competition. Parents must have an opportunity to break out on their own, so that schools can become self-governing and so that the arguments can be put to the test. By breaking that monopoly, parents will be given access to the excellence to which the honourable Member for Dundee, East said he was committed.<br><br>
My honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich was right to say that he saw fear in the eyes of the honourable Member for Fife, Central, who began this morning by rubbishing the survey of professional statisticians. Why would the honourable Gentleman wish to undermine a professional survey before seeing the results? The answer is that he is frightened of what parents want and of what the clause will achieve. I commend the clause to my honourable Friends.</span></p>
