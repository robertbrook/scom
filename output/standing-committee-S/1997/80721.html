	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first item of business is a statement by the Secretary of State on the comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Comprehensive Spending Review</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of Slate for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With permission, Mr. Chairman, I shall make a statement about the comprehensive spending review as it affects Scotland. The comprehensive spending review is about Labour delivering for Scotland. I want Scotland to be the best in Britain. This settlement can make that a reality. I shall first explain the Government's reform strategy since we came to power 15 months ago. Our first priority was jobs and we established the new deal in our first Budget last year. Next came the reforms to make work pay through the working families tax credit and increases in child benefit in the March Budget. The Chancellor has raised pensions, giving security to the oldest and most vulnerable in our communities, and the comprehensive spending review has allowed me to deliver for Scotland's schools and hospitals a massive boost, to set them up properly for the next century. Jobs, pensions, health and education therefore, are Labour's priorities—the priorities of a great reforming Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This settlement delivers an additional £4 billion for Scotland in the three years to 2002. It is an increase in real terms of 6.8 per cent—more than £800 extra for every man, woman and child in Scotland. That is not a hand-out, the political equivalent of a free lunch. The money is for modernisation. Our approach is to invest for reform, so that we get increasingly modern, efficient and effective services for our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are embarking on a process that will revolutionise Government spending, making it ever more focused on outputs rather than inputs. That is why our plans offer firm commitments on class sizes, nursery places, classroom assistants and much more. The settlement offers, for the first time, a three-year public expenditure deal, which will give extra certainty for the new Scottish Parliament. Our plans will deliver almost £1 billion more into Scottish public services next year than would have been spent under the old Tory plans. That will provide a handsome start for the new Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are new pledges on education which sum up the spirit of the settlement: all three-year-olds in Scotland will have the right to a free nursery place by 2002; 5,000 new classroom assistants in Scottish primary schools will bring the ratio of adults to children to 1:15 by 2002, and 42,000 more students will enter Scottish colleges and universities over the period of the review—proof positive that the Government mean what they say on widening access. The settlement will, for the first time, make a reality of a national child care strategy for Scotland. More than £500 million will be invested over the three years, which will double what is spent now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
The intention of our pledge to create 5,000 additional classroom assistants is to free teachers in primary schools of unnecessary administrative burdens and provide them with more support that will allow them to concentrate on their central role in learning and teaching. The new classroom assistants will be under the supervision of the classroom teacher and shall introduce special work-based training qualifications for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second priority is to finance the creation of the most modern health service in Europe. We promise that by next March, waiting lists will be below the levels we inherited and that there will be a £1.8 billion uplift in health spending to maintain that downward pressure. Waiting lists will come down and stay down as we invest for modernisation. The increase in health spending will further rise by £300 million, to almost £600 million and £900 million over the three-year period of the spending review. We shall restore free eye tests for those over 60. No one can doubt our commitment to the essential principle of a system that offers comprehensive cover and is free at the time of need. That will allow the dedicated staff, who have done so much over the years to care for the health service, to face the future with confidence. A £300 million boost for housing will pave the way for greater community ownership and for more private investment in our council housing stock. I am determined to make progress in reducing the debt burden that has built up over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For local government, the settlement can mark a new start. We will reward and support local government in the delivery of vital services to the people of Scotland. I propose a three-year settlement. Councils have wanted that for a long time. It will allow them to plan ahead within a secure framework. Scottish council budgets will increase by £840 million over those three years. Next year, expenditure is set to rise by 4.8 per cent. Councils will welcome the end of crude, universal capping. That is another manifesto pledge that has been delivered. We are also allowing local government more freedom in keeping the receipts from the sale of their own property. That will encourage greater efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tomorrow we shall publish our White Paper on transport in Scotland. Without pre-empting that announcement, let me say to the Committee that the comprehensive spending review settlement for transport represents a modal shift. We are determined to be radical and innovative in the face of problems that, if we do nothing, will simply get worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an important part of our approach to those problems, we shall set out details of a new public transport fund that will enable the Government to support integrated transport initiatives. For example, the resources that we propose to make available—abut £30 million a year—would be enough to provide in a single year 10 bus priority schemes, two park and ride schemes and three new railway stations, such as that at Dalgety Bay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another manifesto pledge has been honoured. We have firmly shut the gates on the programme of large-scale sales of Forestry Commission woods and forests that was planned by our predecessors. That has not been easy as we have had to close a substantial gap. An additional £93 million has been found over the next three years. I hope that that will ensure that there are no significant sales and that we maintain the record on access and on mixed planting that is so important to the environment and to enjoyment of the Scottish countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
We are also investing in Scotland's new Parliament. The plans allow for a world-class Parliament building that will be the symbol of the new democracy in Scotland. In future, Members of that new Parliament will decide what Scotland's spending priorities are. However, today's settlement tells the people what they will get from this Government and from my party: jobs, pensions, education and health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme is built for Scotland and it is designed to meet Scotland's needs. It reflects directly the priorities that Scotland voted for at the election. It will be delivered. It amounts to a social revolution of which I am very proud. I commend the settlement to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the first speaker, I remind Committee members that the statement has no time limit. However, many hon. Members wish to speak in the following debate, so I shall limit the statement accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for giving the statement to the Committee. It is helpful for the Committee to have the opportunity to consider the comprehensive spending review. It would be encouraging to hear that the Committee is meeting again tomorrow to receive the White Paper on transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the greater part of the past 12 months my right hon. and hon. Friends in particularly, my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce)—have urged the Chancellor of the Exchequer to open his war chest, so it would be less than gracious of us not to acknowledge that has been done. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we should examine outputs and the targets that he has set himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge that the extension of pre-school provision for three-year-olds, for which we have campaigned, will take place. Expanded provision for classroom assistants is very welcome, as is additional funding for further and higher education. That shows what happens when debate in the Scottish Grand Committee is initiated by the Liberal Democrats. We appreciate such a response. Reversing cuts in investment in housing is also welcome. Innovative measures in the national health service, such as one-stop clinics, instant personal booking and the free eye tests for all—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, free eye tests are for those over 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pity: I was about to give a particularly warm welcome to free eye tests for all and to ask the Secretary of State why he does not do the same for dental checks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On these occasions, the Government have a tendency to put the best gloss on their actions. The Opposition have duty to strip away that gloss, for example, by pointing out that average spending during this Parliament will be £13.1 billion a year in real terms, against £13.5 billion during the previous Parliament. However, such discussion of the figures often generates more heat than light, and I should like to ask the Secretary of State some specific questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Over the period of the review, what proportion of tuition fees will be retained in the higher education sector? Will the Secretary of State confirm that it will be 100 per cent.?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He mentioned the relaxation of the requirement that local authorities should use 50 per cent. of non-housing asset sales to redeem debt. Why has that relaxation not been extended to sales from council housing? I recall that the Labour shadow Secretary of State for Scotland was very annoyed when the previous Government imposed provisions relating to such sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the implications for the recruitment and retention of doctors, nurses and teachers of the Chancellor's statement about public sector pay? Given the small reserves set out in last week's White Paper, if the Chancellor's plans are assailed by higher inflation, and tax revenues are undermined by growth that is less than was expected, how does the Secretary of State intend that the outputs—to which he has so clearly fixed his objectives—will be maintained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson) was welcoming—or rather, not welcoming—the 1994–95 figures, which gave greater Departmental expenditure limits than any that have been announced today, he said:
	<br><q><p>"Only those who believe that inflation will not affect Government spending will believe the figures and the gloss we have just had from the Secretary of State."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1993; Vol. 234, c. 	<i>315.</i>]</p></q>
If inflation erodes the value of the cash settlement that the Secretary of State announced, how does he intend to maintain the outputs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, when I wrote to the Secretary of State, in November 1997, about additional money for the NHS, he replied:
	<br><q><p>"As regards the Barnett formula, the long standing convention is that the formula does not operate automatically in-year. This means that if resources are made available for (or removed from) an English comparable public expenditure programme the Scottish has no entitlement to the formula consequentials."</p></q>
As we are not discussing a settlement for three years, will the Secretary of State confirm that any increase in an English spending Department during that period will have a knock-on effect, by increasing the amount available, initially to his Department and subsequently to the Scottish Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for his detailed questions, which were constructive in the sense that I suspect that he genuinely wants to know the answers. That is not always a characteristic of the exchanges that take place in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with an apology. There was a slip in the text, although not in what I said, as the hon, and learned Gentleman noticed. The eye tests will be for the over-60s and I was specific about that, but I apologise for the fact that I did not pick up the slip in the text.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman acknowledged that the Chancellor was acting responsibly, although I have to disappoint him by saying that my right hon. Friend was not following the specific advice of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). If my right hon. Friend was following that advice, it was only on a narrow point. He certainly disagrees with the hon. Member for Gordon on a wide range of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
I shall try to deal quickly with the specific questions. The first question was about tuition fees. The Government have made it clear that that money will be used to strengthen the Scottish higher education sector's ability to deal with the expansion of the knowledge economy, which I am sure that we all want to see. As the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) knows, the Government's plans are based on a substantial expansion of further and higher education over the next three or four years. We have encountered a fair degree of unpopularity regarding the new student support system, but that system will allow us to sustain expansion. The hon. and learned Member will recall that the previous Government capped student numbers because of financial restrictions. We have removed that cap because we want expansion. Clearly, an integral part of achieving expansion is to use tuition fee income to sustain and support our programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland asked about local authority budgets, especially the non-housing capital side and sales of properties. The knowledge that the Scottish office would immediately snaffle 50 per cent. of the proceeds was a great disincentive to sell. An apparently attractive price becomes unattractive when it halves. I hope that the programme will give a boost to the capital line, and encourage the authorities to make sensible decisions about when they need assets. Authorities should realise those assets to ensure that the money is put to better use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the housing side, we are attempting to control and reduce the debt. We believed that it was right to leave that provision in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot add much to the hon. and learned Gentleman's wisdom on health service pay. The independent pay review body that deals with such matters remains independent. Governments have been faced with difficult decisions when judging recommendations in the context of economic circumstances. Affordability, as well as inflation and efficiency targets, should be taken into account. However, we shall have to wait for the pay review bodies' recommendations. I hope that the substantial input into the health service of £1.8 billion—a formidable figure—will provide professional opportunities and a better overall service for patients and will boost the morale of those who work in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the general point about reserves, sustainability and ability to fulfil the programme that we have set out. The Government cannot be challenged on their prudent management of the economy. Most arguments, including those of the Liberal Democrats, suggest that we have been overprudent. The Chancellor has made it clear that the golden rule will apply: we shall fund investment, not current expenditure, from borrowing, and we shall control inflation tightly. There is a political price for that. Governments who adopt such measures do not follow a popular line. However, we will have created space by cutting debt servicing by £5 billion a year by the end of the comprehensive spending review period. Responsibility is an important factor in the programme. We are confident that we will sustain the programme over a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. and learned Gentleman's final point, which is entirely legitimate, the consequentials will run. We have had a fair settlement. The full share has come to Scotland, according to the Barnett formula, which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
successive Governments have defended for many years because it is simple and explicable. No, I must not exaggerate—for those who understand it, it is a neat and tidy method of adjusting Scottish expenditure so that it is in line with that of comparable Departments south of the border. I expect that to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my recommendation for a designer for the new Parliament was ignored by the Secretary of State's committee. It was ignored in an exceedingly courteous way; nevertheless, it was ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to anticipate tomorrow's statement by my hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, but, on the modal shift in transport policy, I hope that the Secretary of State will confirm that Caledonian MacBrayne will remain in the public sector, and that two new ferries will be ordered in the near future from Scottish yards. The larger one could be built at Ferguson's on the lower Clyde, and the smaller one could be built at Troon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The management of Caledonian MacBrayne and its location on the Gourock water front needs to be sorted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if my hon. Friend feels that his advice on architectural matters was ignored. The public interest in the design for the Scottish Parliament was extraordinary. Between 30–40,000 people took the trouble to look at the exhibition and pass comments. Therefore, my hon. Friend shares the opinion of many who feel that the decision was not the one that they wanted. However, we have an extremely imaginative and sensitive design team; in terms of architectural content it involves Edinburgh as well as Spain. I look forward to seeing how things develop. I know that my hon. Friend will continue to take a close interest in the matter—and quite right too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to Caledonian MacBrayne, I do not want to pursue matters very far, since there are to be announcements tomorrow. It is important to face the need for a genuine shift in transport policy. Inevitably, some decisions will be unpopular and will be sniped at. However, we need to do something substantial for public transport and tackle gridlock and problems of investment. Those problems will grow and grow if we ignore them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A simple answer that I can give about Caledonian MacBrayne is that it will stay in the public sector. As to the ship orders, abut which local interest is, I understand, very great, my hon. Friend must wait patiently for tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, on behalf of the Scottish National party, I welcome the increases in resources for education and health that the Secretary of State has announced—particularly the plans for nursery places for three-year-olds. That was a general election manifesto commitment of ours—something that I cannot imagine did much to persuade the Secretary of State in his decision. I also welcome the commitments about classroom assistants and improvements in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's offer of a three-year spending approach, which was to a significant extent demanded by local authorities. It will help them with their forward planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) mentioned the right hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson) and I want to do so too. In his response to the public expenditure settlement for 1994–95, the right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><q><p>"When we look behind the figures, expose the creative accountancy and blow away the blizzard of hype, the truth is a whole lot different and much nastier."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1993; Vol. 234, c. 313.]</p></q>
While I should not venture to say that it is a whole lot nastier, there is certainly a truth behind the hype. Will the Secretary of State confirm that in the first two years of implementing his party's manifesto he has cut public expenditure in Scotland on a cumulative, real-terms basis, by more than £1 billion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the right hon. Gentleman also confirm analysis produced by the House of Commons Library, showing that Scottish Office expenditure is projected to increase by 0.4 per cent. per annum in real terms over the five years of the present Government, compared with 1.3 per cent. per annum under the previous Government? Will he confirm that the departmental expenditure limit for the Scottish Office will fall, as a share of United Kingdom totals, from 7.92 per cent. in 1997–98 to 7.53 per cent. in 2001–02?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great care to the Secretary of State's response about the security of the spending plans against inflation, which would be above the estimated figure. He said that the Government were prudent in their estimate, and determined to ensure that they were applied. I took that, and the right hon. Gentleman's comments that there was a political price to pay for that prudent financial management, to mean that the price of protecting against inflation might be higher interest rates. What protection can he offer or the security of the spending plans, and the prospect of their being applied in year three without any qualification resulting from changes in estimates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as to public sector pay, the Government have clearly invested in public services, but I am sceptical about whether they are prepared to invest in people. What reassurance can the Secretary of State give to public sector workers, whose pay increases are already trailing private sector increases in Scotland, that they will be decently remunerated at the end of the period in question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should welcome the welcome that has been given to some of the measures that we have introduced, particularly in education and health. The hon. Gentleman is right to welcome them; they are substantial additional cash inputs, and the prospect of the output is exciting. What we are doing will, I hope, mean a real raising of educational standards—it will ensure that the health service remains comprehensive in cover and genuinely free at the point of need. I hope that the hon. Gentleman shares our objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that to the hon. Gentleman because of the four-year spending programme that the Scottish National party put forward last year. If I remember rightly, on 14 July on a "Good Morning Scotland" broadcast, he described that programme as alive and kicking, but its input for the health service would have been only £35 million a year. His protestations ring a little hollow when one considers that figure against a budget of more than £4,000 million. It is statistically insignificant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The Scottish National party claims that it wants to be the guardian of he health service and to give it high priority. However, those arguments look hollow when the last two years of its four-year programme are compared to the first two years of the comprehensive spending review. The Scottish National party promised £70 million when the Government have promised an input of close on £1,000 million. Although I accept that the hon. Gentleman's congratulations are genuine, I also assume that they have been given to reflect gratitude for the fact that the Government have tackled a problem that the Scottish National party clearly and self-evidently was not going to tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are many ways of looking at the figures. As the hon. Gentleman probably knows—he has no doubt done much work on them—if we take 1994–95 as the criteria for the total Scottish Office budget and consider the per capita expenditure figure, we will find that the Government are spending more than was spent at that time. The real difference between this Government and the previous one relates to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson), who was the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said about creative accountancy and nasty things under the surface. In 1994–95, spending was financed by a massive increase in public borrowing, which took place for short-term political reasons and could not possibly be sustained. It is a measures of this Government's responsibility that, under a fusillade criticism from the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, we have held to our plans to put public finances in sound order. By bon owing to invest, not to fund current expenditure, we have produced a plan and are confident that it will be delivered. That is the essential difference between what happened in 1994–95 and now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is saying that we are not providing enough—other hon. Members in other parties are saying that we are providing too much—let me remind him that in two overlapping years the Scottish National party's proposed budget was £1.7 billion and that ours is £2.1 billion. It will be spent on Scotland's real priorities—health, education and housing. I am happy for our commitments to stand comparison with the alive-and-kicking—not doubt, in protest—budget that the Scottish National party produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making an investment in people. We are investing in people who work and care for the health service and people who teach our children and work in our schools, and we are investing heavily in a large expansion of student places. In the next few years, we will create 43,000 student places when the Scottish National party's budget proposals would not have produced a single additional place. If we are talking about the knowledge economy and giving people opportunity, that is a significant comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On pay, the health service will have an independent review body and teachers will have the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee machinery. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not dispute that affordability has to be a consideration for employers and Government when it comes to teachers' and health service pay. Inflation and efficiency are other factors that must be taken into account. The review bodies have retained their independence and we shall await the outcomes. However, it is clear that those who work in those public services will be immensely encouraged by a Government who

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
have made a long-term commitment and have done so on a basis that suggests that that commitment can be maintained and delivered much to the benefit of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what will happen because these issues will run into the Scottish Parliament. However, I will be proud to campaign on the Government's priorities. I firmly believe that they will be backed by the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is so much in the public spending review for Scotland that we could spend all day applauding my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's efforts. His policies justified the confidence of the people of the Carron and Carronshore ward in my constituency of Falkirk, East who, on 18 June, saw off the challenge of the Scottish nationalists and elected Craig Martin, returning the Labour candidate back to Falkirk council with an increased majority. That shows how the people put their faith in the Government's pledge to treat local government fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I especially welcome my right hon. Friend's statement that we are at last withdrawing from the Conservatives' strategy, wich was to introduce capping, thereby effectively voting themselves into a majority in every council in Scotland and in the UK. That is going to be reversed and the people of Scotland will take that as a mark of respect for the way in which the Government and my right hon. Friend are treating local government by, restoring its independence. I am sure that local government will use its independence rightly and properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the approach to housing, which is to withdraw debt gradually from local authorities sand free up resources for them. Will my right hon. Friend explain how we can ensure that a council such as Falkirk, which has been thrifty and fiscally responsible and has a low average housing debt—as well as councils burdened with a large historical debt, often city councils—will also benefit from the Government's approach? How can we ensure that such thrifty councils receive a fair response from the Government and that some capital is freed up for their use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I appreciate my hon. Friend's points and one of the main features of our settlement is giving back a degree of responsibility to local government. The duty of local government to act responsibly will remain. We have set out certain parameters for council tax, which we hope will be met or even improved on, and we shall retain residual powers. However, the annual ritual of capping can be relaxed and, on the capital spend side of non-housing matters, grate freedom of manoeuvre is being granted to councils, which live in a changing world. Where there are shortfalls, we will have to act to deal with them and some outstanding issues remain in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the low housing debt of Falkirk council. That authority also showed great initiative and imagination in private finance initiative development for schools and school buildings, which I applaud. I hope that we can work with councils to improve the delivery of services for those who depend on them. That is an important partnership and I want it to continue, but it must be carried forward on the basis that we are living through a time of change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Much of the money we need for housing will be levered in from the private sector on a partnership basis. I want a strong emphasis on community ownership and a mixture of tenure. That will improve choice and the quality of life for people living in the housing stock, which must be the end and overriding priority both for central Government and for councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I too am sorry that we will not have a statement from the Transport Minister tomorrow because I wanted to ask questions about Caledonian MacBrayne and about roads in Argyll, which are subject to landslides [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Too many lanslides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of this week's announcement of a £840 million boost for local authorities, will the Secretary of State tell us whether any additional funding will go to authorities such as Argyll and Bute, which has been landed with the unexpected and unwelcome debt of £28.5 million from the accounts of Strathclyde regional council? Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the extra money includes—at last—a special annual needs allowance for Argyll and Bute, which has to deliver costly services to its many island communities? I have asked about this year after year and I hope that at last the Government will respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot promise a total exemption from landslides of whatever kind in Argyll and Bute. I am afraid that I must give the hon. Lady a reasonably cautious answer. I cannot promise to provide the special islands allowance. The hon. Lady has pursued this matter with immense persistence over the years and will no doubt continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £840 million in the coming three years is obviously an important additional resource for the councils. Some of it is to be used for the improvements to education, including nursery education, to which we are committed, and obviously that must be taken into account. However, these are exciting opportunities for local government in Scotland, because local authorities will be centrally involved in much of the proposed expansion. Nursery education, classroom assistance and other proposals have given authorities new horizons and opportunities, which I hope councillors of every party will welcome. We shall discuss in detail the hon. Lady's points about Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland on the comprehensive spending review, which addresses issues of genuine concern to my constituents, who voted for additional resources for education, health and housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr Swinney) should be wary of quoting 1994–95 by way of comparison with the comprehensive spending review. He ought to remember the other issues that were important at the time, such as local government reorganisation and the death of the poll tax. That apart, given the excellent work done by Scottish Enterprise, is my right hon. Friend satisfied that the reduction in its budget will not undermine its crucial role in Scotland's economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is indeed a falling industry line in the comprehensive spending review, for three principal reasons, all of which are valid. Sadly, the first is that the Hyundai project has been rephased and does not appear in the first two years of the review, which means that the finance that we expected to spend there has fallen out of he calculation. I do not necessarily anticipate the Hyundai project not going ahead; we know that the company is strongly committed to it when it is able to proceed and we look forward to that, but the rephasing has obviously necessitated a readjustment in the industry line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason is that a shift that we have agreed with Scottish Enterprise means that it will withdraw from the property market on a phased basis. We were advised that its presence is not helping. Scottish Enterprise agreed with us that some of its holdings could be disposed of advantageously and that a phased withdrawal makes every possible sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and, perhaps, the most substantial reason is that we have included an adjustment to Scottish Enterprise's training budget. However, that simply recognises that, under a completely different heading outwith the Scottish Office block, £90 million a year is coming into Scotland through the new deal, and that duplication that would be extremely difficult to defend would have occurred there. None of the key Scottish Enterprise range of activities such as the new business birth rate, encouraging small indigenous businesses or inward investment in Locate in Scotland, have been attacked or put at risk and we look forward to Locate in Scotland and Scottish Enterprise continuing their successful campaigns in the period ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I should tell the Secretary of State that our difference of opinion with the Government is that we would have liked to have seen the expenditure in education begin to grow in real terms after the election, not two years later. The situation has worsened during that time and the Government have put in increases which are much more vulnerable to shocks. That was the basis of our manifesto commitment. The Secretary of State pointed out that the first of his ambitions is to get the waiting lists in hospitals in Scotland back to where they were when the Government were elected, which is not the most ambitious of first pledges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could ask more specifically about the education budget. The real increase in local government spending over the period is 2.4 per cent. which, given the educational commitment and all the other responsibilities of local government, does not leave much for real expansion in education. How much will nursery education for three years cost and how much of the total allocation for local authorities for nursery education will be taken up within that increase? What will be left for schools which are obviously the prime responsibility of local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency the local authority is desperate for authorisation to build a new secondary school and a new primary school, and I am talking about communities where the population is growing rapidly. The local authority has no positive sign that it is being realistic in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
terms of what it has to deliver. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State could explain exactly how the increase in funding for schools which are the responsibility of local authorities will be funded in real terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer some of those points specifically. The pre-school funding is £31 million, £48 million and £52 million which, together with the total of £7 million of basic education grant, adds up to £138 million over the period. No doubt there will be cries of pain if my mental arithmetic is wrong. It is quite a substantial amount and an important injection which allows us to have a base in the pre-school period which will stand children in good stead as they move into primary and then secondary education. It also has a social purpose for the parents as it liberates them for other activities and perhaps for employment, but its educational purpose is the one that I would stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the school budget as a whole, the figure is more than £600 million in the three-year period, but I can confirm that later. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that it is an important contribution. He said that it was better late than never and I suppose that I should be satisfied with a hint of approval from the Liberal Democrat Benches. If we had gone hell for leather as they suggested—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, a little bit of taxation here, a few hundred million there, which would add up to a few billion. I get a little confused. At one point tax-raising powers were not going to be used and now I gather they are. No doubt that can be clarified in the months ahead. The point is that if we had gone too fast many of their fears about the economy might have become a reality, which we would now be beginning to lament. It was absolutely right to take it steadily; to establish a platform of stability and then to move sensibly forward on a broad front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waiting lists are quite obstinate partly because as they are cut, people with less acute conditions who are out in the community tend to be sucked in and added to them. Keeping waiting lists down is not easy. That is our aim. By mid-March we will get them down below the level that we inherited and by the end of the comprehensive spending review they will be 10,000 below that. That is a challenging target. We spent £44 million last year setting that up and we hope that that will allow us to deal with some of the blockages and structural difficulties that perhaps have held up put through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are budgeting for a quite significant increase in health service activity during the coming period. It is right that it should be four per cent. but it is not right that such objectives would be easily achieved if only the Government had a little smeddum and were prepared to apply themselves. The targets are challenging, but that is the point. We are confident that we can meet them and I hope that in a few years' time our Committee can look back with satisfaction on what has been achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the statement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the increased expenditure in many areas—areas in which we would all like extra money—particularly as I come from a background of belief in public spending as a means of redistribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask my hon. Friend about his reference to the modernisation of services. I fear that modernisation is a word that covers a multitude of purposes, indeed sins, and I would like clarification of, for example, the term "nursery places". Will we have family-friendly provision in terms of hours and year-long cover, or will the provision be determined by the sort of professional turf wars that determine so much of our public sector services in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the numbers of students in colleges and universities, will the existing pattern of attraction be maintained or will positive efforts be made to draw more students from sectors which have not traditionally provided large numbers of our students? That would ensure that we break the mould of existing higher and further education provision in Scotland, which reflects existing social and financial advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also seek clarification on public sector pay. I share some of the reservations that have been expressed, but stress that, while many hon. Members are concerned about the pay of doctors, nurses and teachers, we are also concerned about those in the public services who are on lower salaries—those working in the manual sector. Will my hon. Friend's assurances about recruitment and career progression in regard to the professional side of the public service sector apply to other sides of it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I seek clarification on asset sales. Local authorities differ in their position on existing assets. What steps will my hon. Friend take to ensure that asset-poor local authorities will not be unduly penalised by a relaxation of the existing rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take those points briefly, if I may. On my hon. Friend's last point, we shall discuss the matter with local authorities. If large distortions are involved, we shall face them, as we have always been willing to do. As my hon. Friend will know, there were major distortions in the previous settlements which would have put an enormous burden on council tax payers in Glasgow and several other authorities, because of the changes in the social work grant-aided expenditure. Working in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, we found a sensible way of smoothing out the situation, which was a tribute to sound co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said all that I can say about pay. However, I remind my hon. Friend—although I am sure I do not need to do so and that he agrees with the point—that the last thing that we want is an escalation in pay, which would mean only that they would be eaten up by inflation.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
We would get suspiciously close to a stop-go cycle and would end up with real problems in sustaining the progress that we want. It is in everyone's interest that we try to guard against that. However, my hon. Friend is of course right that morale and retention of staff in the public services are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a flexible approach to child care. We want to ensure, through local authorities working in partnership with the voluntary and private sectors, that we achieve our promised coverage for four-year-olds and, when the provision comes into effect the following year, for three-year-olds. I am keen that, as we can, we develop wrap-round care. I see examples in my constituency, week in, week out, of the many people who want to and could get a job but who are deterred by the availability and cost of child care, even after they have allowed for the vital assistance that will be provided by the working families credit system. A child care strategy will ensure that we overcome that barrier. Obviously, growth will be gradual but that is our objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have always given a high priority to encouraging wider access to education. The great row about tuition fees often passed over the fact that 40 per cent. of those entering Scottish universities are from the poorest backgrounds and so would not have to pay anything. Therefore, there is no threat to those at the bottom end of the family income scale who want to enter higher education. My hon. Friend the Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office, is rightly proud of the fact that part-time students have become an object of Government attention for the first time. To a large extent, the problems that they encountered have been abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the comprehensive spending review will provide an additional 2,000 university places. The bulk of people filling those places will come from further education. We have allocated an additional £240 million over the three years for that. I hope that that will put colleges on a sound basis and will equip them to meet the challenges confronting them. Meeting those targets is a central wish. We believe that we are providing resources to aid that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State say more about housing and housing debt? The latest figure for Scottish housing debt is £4 billion. Scottish Homes estimates that the value of the entire public sector stock is no more than £2.5 billion. Given that the situation has arisen as a result of central Government-driven policy on discounted sales, is not that a strong argument for helping the Scottish public sector by a write-off, by a transfer of debt or by one of the many technical devices that were used in the privatisations that took place under the previous Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise budget undergoing a third successive year of cuts? What consultations did the Secretary of State have with the chairman and the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise before he reached his decision? What is the cumulative cut for Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise over the past three years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to compare the SNP manifesto with the Labour manifesto, both for the last election and for next year's elections for the Scottish Parliament. The Secretary of State gave the impression that when the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
right hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson) attacked the 1994–95 settlement as member of the Opposition, he was concerned about prudence in Government finance. In fact, he said that that settlement was inadequate and that it represented
	<br><q><p>"massive real cuts in public expenditure".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1993; Vol. 234, c. 314.]</p></q>
The amount that the Secretary of State for Scotland has announced for 2001 is less than that for 1994–95 by any usual measurement and in per capita terms in the departmental expenditure limits. So how can
	<br><q><p>"massive real cuts in public expenditure"</p></q>
be translated into the massive boost that he has claimed today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have put in place a 22.1 per cent. increase in housing finance. That may not appear generous to the hon. Gentleman who, I think, sometimes lives in a world of imagination. I put that kindly, in terms of, for example, fiscal surpluses in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, 22.1 per cent. represents a substantial boost. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we must work in partnership with local authorities and—above all—with tenants on new forms of housing. Of course, we must also work in partnership with the private sector, which levers in cash. We will struggle with a housing problem in Scotland and with declining standards in the public sector housing stock for a long time if we do not start to show a little imagination. I hope that the spending boost and the innovative nature of the policies that we intend to pursue will win the approval of the hon. Gentleman. I am probably an optimist—I am always an optimist in politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talk to Scottish Enterprise a great deal. I talk to Crawford Beveridge and to Sir Ian Wood frequently. I talked to Sir Ian just before and just after the announcement, although the poor man was on holiday
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
in America and had to be found. The link is important to the Scottish Office, if only because Scottish Enterprise is a major Government agency that spends more than £400 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that agreement was reached about phasing out property. There was recognition that the Hyundai situation was as I described it. I am puzzled because he implies that he would have made no adjustment to the training budget and would simply have added on the extra £90 million due in each of the next three years. That might have produced a spectacular total but it would have been an impractical approach, suggesting a lack of thought about the use of finance to make social progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that a different situation emerges on a per capita basis. I emphasise that we are making an important change of direction that will be a boost for the public sector. It may well be judged on the basis that it will provide a nursery place for every three-year-old, put 5,000 classroom assistants into primary schools, provide more than 40,000 new student places and produce a national child care strategy that will consume more than £500 million over the next three years. We will also be able to improve health services in a practical way that will bring real advantages to patients—one-stop clinics, a personalised booking system for consultant appointments and a range of other initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is a budget that provides all that not worthy of some notice and praise? If not, I find it truly extraordinary. I contrast our plans with the pledge of the Scottish National party to spend £100 million on renationalising the Scottish end of Railtrack. My priorities are hospitals and schools, not renationalising the Scottish end of Railtrack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am grateful for the opportunity to debate a child care strategy for Scotland. However, the first thing on all our minds today must be the tragic case of Helen Stacey, a child minder found guilty of murdering a young child in her care. I know that all members of the Committee will join me in expressing their deepest sympathy for the parents. We will reflect carefully on the tragedy to see what lessons can be learnt from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall examine thoroughly the regulation and inspection system for child care to establish what improvements can be made. We also intend to develop training qualifications in child care. As the Green Paper clearly states, we cannot take any risks with the safety of children. The recent tragic case underlines the need for the Government to paly a more active role in child care.

	<br><q><p>"the development of a childcare strategy which matches the development of a modern labour market and enables parents, especially women, to balance family and working life."</p></q>
Pursuing that commitment, we published in May a major Green Paper, "Meeting the Childcare Challenge", which marks an important step forward. It sets out our broad strategy and how it will be implemented. We are seeking views before finally deciding on the best way forward. We have had to move forward from a standing start. Never before have a Government had a child care strategy: this is the first and it is being introduced by a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been achieved by local authorities, local enterprise companies and voluntary and private bodies, but much remains to be done. our long-term aid, set out in the Green Paper, is
	<br><q><p>"to ensure good quality, affordable childcare for children aged 0 to 14 in every neighbourhood, including both formal childcare and support for informal arrangements."</p></q>
That change will cost money and we have not shied away from that. This year, we are making an extra £5 million available to local authorities and others to stimulate child care provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the comprehensive spending review, we are making available an additional £250 million for pre-school education and child care over the period 1999–2002. That means that we shall spend £500 million on child care and pre-school education over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention pre-school education because of its close links with child care for three and four-year-olds. By 2002, we aim to ensure a free part-time pre-school place for all children of three and over whose parents believe that they would benefit from it. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, that is a substantial commitment, and it is one to which we are allocating an extra £138 million over the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
makes up only a short slot each day? The Secretary of State talked about liberating parents, so has the Minister examined how the additional child care at each end of the educational element will be provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is crucial and relates to the development of wrap-around care, about which I shall say a few words. Wrap-around care is good not only for children, but for their parents. It frees them up to make other choices. Such care is integral and we are consulting on it in the Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wrap-around care is why we are making additional moneys available through the comprehensive spending review. I shall make further announcements later this year about exactly how much will be provided and how it will be targeted. They will answer the hon. Gentleman's question. However, those moneys will support local child care partnerships, will pay for the regulation and inspection of the greatly enhanced child are provision and will help in the education and training of all those involved in child care. On top of the moneys from the comprehensive spending review, £25 million will be available from 1999–2003 in lottery resources. That will be used to pump prime investment in out-of-school child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £500 million that I mentioned odes not take account of the extra resources that will go into child care once the new child care tax credit within the working families tax credit comes on stream in October next year. Although we do not have precise figures for the take-up and how much that will cost, our best estimate is that the child care tax credit will increase the resources going into child care from the tax and benefits system by 10 times: from some £3 million to about £25 million to £30 million a year. That is a vital step in making child care affordable to lower-income families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child care tax credit and the resources from the comprehensive spending review will allow us to tackle the existing problems in child care that were identified in the Green Paper. First as we all know, the quality of child care can be variable. Local authority registration for child care provision for the under-eights ensures that standards are applied, but the way in which standards are applied can vary and the registration applies only to under-eights. Although a number of organisations work in this area, quality assurance systems are not yet robust enough to ensure similarity throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the cost of child care can be prohibitively high, and that is the reason for the child care tax credit. Thirdly, and particularly in rural areas, child care provision can be very sparse. Those problems must be tackled by the child care strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I appreciate the Minister's points, will he refer to the costs of bringing up a child with special needs? According to the this month's findings of the Joseph Rowntree Trust, it costs £7,355 to bring up a child with special needs. That is three times the average. Is attention being given to that in the overall spending review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady highlights something very important. The greater cost is dealt with not only in the child care strategy, but through all the other agencies, the health service and the education system. Several groups are doing relevant work and I appreciate the importance of dealing with the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
As the hon. Lady's point highlights, no one agency can tackle all the problems. Central Government cannot act alone. We need many partners. That is why we have given local authorities a role in setting up local child care partnerships. They will be convened by local authorities, but not dominated by them. The partners will include all the Government agencies, the voluntary sector, employers, local enterprise companies, further education colleges and the health service. Partnership of that kind is the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, one of the key features of the proposals is a Scottish child care board, which would operate at a level above the partnerships. The Government have adopted a bonfire of the quangos approach, and while I do not argue that such a board would be wrong, how does the Minister justify setting up another quango when we have been trying to get away from them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a quango, but a small body to provide advice at the initial setting-up stage. It will not be time limited, but we shall review it after a few years. It is too consist merely of some appointments for people with expertise in the relevant field to advise us on how to set up the local partnership and on how the lottery funding stream might be dealt with. We have also advertised for two people to reflect aspects of the public's perceptions, instead of involving only experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We aim to improve the quality of child care in many ways. The first, which is particularly important in the context of my earlier remarks, is by improving regulation. In addition to increasing resources for regulation, we are about to produce a further consultation paper on standards in day care and early education, which will identify possible improvements to or rationalisation of the existing system. We shall also examine the training and qualifications framework for the profession, to ensure that it meets the needs of employers and children. We want training ladders that people can progress up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall help parents to afford child care by increasing child benefit; by helping parents in education and training; by increasing the child care disregard in family credit this year and introducing the new child care tax credit for next year; and by providing resources to local authorities so that, through local partnerships, they can support key projects in their areas. Having increased resources, we shall make child care more accessible by promoting significant increases in provision and aiming to ensure that all children in the pre-school year have access to a part-time pre-school education place by this winter—extending that to all three-year-olds by 2002. Finally, and very importantly, we intend to develop information services for parents—particularly local help lines in every local authority. All local authorities have been given funding to set up and develop help lines this year. That will continue. Our aim is that a mother or father wanting information will be able to pick up the phone, dial a number and be given information there and then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all that we are doing, we aim to meet the needs of children and parents. I do not see a conflict between helping one of those groups or the other; the two activities are mutually reinforcing. Parents will be happy leaving
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
their children in others' care if they are satisfied that they will be well looked after and adequately stimulated. A parent who has access to a job—or a better job than previously—through training, may provide a secure environment for a child, leading to a role for the child in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is talking about parents wanting jobs. There is a problem in rural areas when mothers want to go out to work and to resume their careers but cannot because there are no child care facilities. Yet the voluntary sector, which wants to set up proper child care facilities, cannot do so because it does not know what the demand is. In the end neither side gets what it wants. Who will try to resolve this problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. lady is right. Part of the function of the local chid care partnerships when they are set up will be to have an audit not just of what they provide, but of the needs within their areas so that they can match needs and provision. Provision in rural areas can indeed be difficult. The strategy needs to be different. Several members of our non-quango Scottish Child Care Board are there to address the problem for me. The provision might be based more on child minders than elsewhere, so we are trying to look into that. There is much more that I could say on the subject, but I have spoken for long enough and I hope that we will develop the arguments. I may say more on the matter when I reply. To reiterate, for the first time ever Scotland has a national child care strategy and it has be en set up by a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to participate in the debate. I shall try to be brief as a great number of hon. Members stood up when the Minister sat down. I speak as a member of the all-party children group and it is important to recognise the all-party basis for this. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) has done a great deal of work in this sphere. The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) has also been involved and other members of the Committee have worked long and hard in the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well remember our preparations for the Children (Scotland) Bill, as it then was, and the activities of the Government. We undertook special procedures whereby we met many groups the length and breadth of Scotland who dealt with child care in its widest sense. Representatives of all aspects of child care were invited to give evidence and we took both written and oral evidence. Although the resulting Act was perhaps not perfect in every sphere it was certainly a great step forward. Now that we are looking at a child care strategy for Scotland we should look back at some of that evidence and give it serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an ideal world we all like to think that all children are brought up in a happy family and that everything is pleasant for them, but we found that the reality is just not like that. Sometimes it takes people a long time to expose the dangers to which children are often subjected. There is much more openness and honesty in society nowadays about what can happen to children. We must look at our child care strategy in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MR. JIMMY HOOD 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I could go through a number crunching exercise, but today is not the occasion for that. There was substantial number crunching in the statement. The real test for child care in Scotland will be to ensure its delivery. I welcome the additional expenditure which is being made available for pre-school education and for education as a whole. I also welcome the fact that the Minister mentioned the need for the registration of child carers and for people who are involved in any kind of work with our children. We must all be horrified by the headlines in our papers today. The danger of shaking a child was highlighted way back in the 1970s in the Select Committee on violence in the family on which I served but only now does it seem to be a headline issue.</p>
	<p>I should like to ask the Minister about the classroom assistants. In my earlier intervention I mentioned children with disabilities and special needs. Classroom assistants will be welcome, but I and parents seek reassurance that such assistants will be qualified and will have genuine knowledge of education and child care. That matter is as important as the registration of the various establishments.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the statement about classroom assistants. We must be absolutely sure that, in the absence of teachers such assistants are not seen as replacements for teachers, especially if the teachers are off for a long time and the local authority is strapped for cash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like me, the hon. Lady has professional qualifications. She is a speech therapist and I am a teacher of children with special needs, and we both recognise the importance of a professional background. Although many people wish to help in schools, we must have a clear definition of the duties of classroom assistants so that they do not replace teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish National party will submit a response to the Government's consultation paper and I do not want to pre-empt that. However, I should like to make one or two comments before I give way to other hon. Members, because it is important that all our voices should be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the Government have recognised that good quality and affordable child care is required from zero to 14 years. I welcome the statement in the Green Paper that there should be even provision throughout the country, but it is vital that areas, such as my own, in which there are several large towns, but also many small villages and outlying cottages for farm and forestry workers, must be guaranteed full access to the child care network. Several hon. Members have referred to that matter, but I want to re-emphasise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gaps in the existing provisions are acknowledged in the Green Paper. Hon. Members will all have had countless letters from, arid meetings with, our constituents about the long waiting lists for the only playgroup in the area. There are many problems, including unsuitable accommodation, high costs and the level of quality control and training. Such problems must not be left to the vagaries of the market—as the previous Government wished to do. There must be a national strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working families tax credit is a step in the right direction. However, the Government's figures show, and criticisms from parents' groups confirm, that the level of support offered is not sufficient to meet the costs of day
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
care or pre-school care in many parts of the country, especially for families with two or more children. There is also a feeling that too much of the Government's strategy is geared to parents who choose to work, rather than to those who, for whatever reason, might want to stay at home. No stigma should be attached to being a mother, or father, who wishes to stay at home, and more consideration should be given to that matter. No doubt, that point will be raised in the response to this and other consultation papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to discuss the position of single parents who want to enter further education, and the provision of courses under the new deal. There seems to be an anomaly in the new deal for lone parents that prevents many single parents from accessing the study element of the package and the child care assistance that forms part of it. If such support is available through the new deal for young people, why do there appear to be restrictions on single parents? It is much easier for young people to gain access to the new deal than it is for single parents. Will the Government consider that matter during their discussions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, our priority in Scotland must be to ensure that we have the best quality child care strategy. The Scottish Parliament will provide opportunities for all of us who work in the sphere of child care. Before the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, we worked together and took evidence, so I hope that, in the Scottish Parliament, we will be able to discuss matters with all the groups that have expertise, not only one group that has been appointed to advise the Minister. All Members of the Scottish Parliament should have access to such information, so that we can introduce legislation that is effective in terms of cost, which will always be a consideration in view of the budgetary restraints on the Scottish Parliament, but that is also effective for the people whom we serve. We face a huge challenge. The programme may be a basis for tackling it, but there is much to do in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I almost wish a Conservative Member was present this morning because I am a regular reader of Mr. Gerald Warner's column. He was taken to extremely intemperate criticism of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. On nursery education, Mr. Warner says:
	<br><q><p>"Every incentive luring working mothers out of the home is an investment in Armageddon."</p></q>
That has caused many a cheery chuckle at meetings of women's groups that I have addressed. That is one example among many that show why there are no Conservative Members among us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary who has responsibilities for children pointed out, the Government are the first Administration to commit themselves to a child care strategy for Scotland. It is hard to credit that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
child care is being comprehensively tackled for the first time after 70 years of universal suffrage. The Scottish Parliament will undertake most of the strategy's implementation. For more than 10 years, organisations that are involved with children have criticised the paucity of early-years services in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time ago, when I was nearly elected as a Member of Parliament, I remember—the hon. Member for Moray may also remember—that Bronwen Cohen, who is now director of Children in Scotland, published a report on levels of public funding for child care in the European Union. Britain was equal bottom with Portugal. The position did not improve much during the Tory years. Children in Scotland's early-years advisory group called for a more strategic and multicultural approach to child care services. It is high time that legislation and provision caught up with changes in society, and with modern reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most mothers want to work, and they need care arrangements that cover their children's school years. Many early debates concentrated on pre-school years, and little attention was paid to the need for appropriate child care for working mothers whose children were at school. In 1992, the United Kingdom signed up to the European Union recommendation on child care. It emphasised the need for Governments to tackle the inconsistencies that arose when different authorities were responsible for different services. It has taken until now, and the advent of a Labour Government, to act on the recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation also emphasised the importance of parental leave, and of men and women sharing responsibilities for the care of children. Society is changing. Nowadays, young fathers are more likely to share responsibility. We must also bear in mind that there are many single parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals focus on the needs of working parents, and also benefit children by improving the quality of care, its affordability and accessibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that local authorities will be given responsibilities for establishing local child care partnerships with all the relevant voluntary and private sector bodies, and drawing up local child care plans. I should be glad if my hon. Friend the Minister could consider that aspect. A number of locally based organisations have fallen foul of urban aids coming to an end and, through no fault of their own have had to end much-valued services. I hope that some means can be found to enable them quickly to re-enter the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging that a Scottish child care board has been formed to advise the Minister on priorities and best practices. However, the consultation paper raises some questions on which I shall speak briefly. One question is whether any given group of children should be given particular help. I have in mind the children of parents who suffer domestic violence. It is not sufficient simply to lay on resources for play and are while a single mother looks for work and tries to establish a separate family home. Such children will have suffered hugely from the experiences of their young lives and may need considerable help to overcome them. Not enough attention has yet been focused on that group. Scottish Women's Aid, which as considerable experience in helping traumatised children, has raised that point. Great attention
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
has rightly been paid to the needs of women who flee abuse, but often children who have suffered from seeing a mother being mauled about may themselves be in danger of suffering physical or mental abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question is encouraging employers to participate in nursery schemes. Although we may do all that we can to encourage participation by employers, in some instances we could wait forever for that to happen. Experience shows that generally they have participated only when their own economic necessity required it because they could not otherwise retain highly trained, valuable staff. In any case, it makes greater sense to provide such schemes as locally as possible—where families live, rather than where a parent works—for many good reasons. It would enable children to play with neighbouring children, it would avoid a child being taken some distance across a town, or through miles of countryside in bad weather and, when problems arose, it would be easier to find another parent nearby to assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Minister's comments on a single national recognition scheme. Recent tragic events have shown that it is vital that those who take charge of children can be trusted with them. Safety is paramount, but it is not the only issue. It is not good enough for parents simply to dump children on someone, leaving them until they return from work. A child's progress and development must be part of our consideration. I know that the Government have taken that on board. People caring for children must be fit persons who are properly trained. They must be paid a rate that reflects the responsibility that they undertake. No one doubts that money spent on children is money well spent and it is a pity that it has taken until now—under a Labour Government—for that to be recognised with hard cash. The additional funding will enhance educational attainment and a responsible attitude towards others and it will help to overcome the handicaps of poverty or inadequate, or downright bad, parenting. This huge step forward has been welcomed by numerous organisations working with children in Scotland. I am especially glad that extra finance has been made available because it shows that the Government are putting their money where their mouth is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.58 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie (Edinbugh, West)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome without reservation or grumbling the Green Paper and the Minister's statement. However, I shall try to make a few constructive comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem in our society is that a considerable number of people who are at home would like to be at work and a considerable number of people who are at work would prefer to be at home. We have to create a society that allows a fair and open choice between the two. The Green Paper goes a good way to achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that the provision of more and more care for young children will lead to earlier and earlier education for young children. Although the care is important, it should be recognised that we start our formal education ealier than most European countries. It is vital that the care of young children is not the same as starting primary school at two or three. I hope that we can guard against that adverse step while retaining our enthusiasm for care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
Accessibility is an issue in rural areas. The problem of transport will have to be addressed. At the moment, the state provides travel to school Will it provide travel to statutory child care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our school curriculum should pay more attention to issues such a parenting. I know that there is great pressure on school curriculums and that everyone wants their pet subject to be included in them, but training our young people to become good citizens should include training them to become good parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Child care partnerships are a good idea, but they must co-operate with existing organisations in the community. All of us must have experienced in our constituencies the establishment of more and more new bodies that flex their muscles and do not always co-operate with each other as well as they should. Child are partnerships should not be big muscular players on the park, pushing aside existing organisations. We want to make as much use as possible of existing facilities such as community centres and schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of employers. We envisage that a social partnership—or whatever grandiose title we decide to give it—could exist between employers, employees and the unions to provide child care. The tax regime, both personal and company, should promote that. Employers do get a mention, but their role could be expanded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for qualifications, regulation and providing a career for people entering child care, it should be recognised that such jobs—for example being a nanny—are more important than they once were. Many couples who are lucky enough to have well-paid jobs can survive only by employing a nanny. There is no registration or organised vetting of nannies. The system must include a registration that states whether people are child minders or nannies, or whether they work more collectively with children. We must produce a proper career structure, proper qualifications and proper vetting. The taxation system should allow for that. I understand that the tax credit system does not cover nannies. Those elements should be brought together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other issues are peripheral but relevant to our concerns about the welfare of our children. For example, we do not pay enough attention to bullying at school. Most, if not all, schools have a nice document that sets out their anti-bullying policy, but it is much harder to do something about bullying. I recently received significant complaints from two distant areas of Scotland involving children who left school a year early because of bullying. We should also be worried about our tendency to ignore under-age drinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the situation of children in care has improved, such children almost inevitably ended up in gaol. That is totally unacceptable. We must consider that aspect of care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Bullying is an issue with which schools, and indeed all of us, find it difficult to deal. It tends to be swept under the carpet and it must be tackled with much greater vigour.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
I have been involved in the setting up of two after-school care clubs. Many such clubs only just keep their heads above water financially. When usage declines, they find themselves in deficit. Local child care partnerships should help to fund those after-school clubs, playgroups and nurseries that are often perfectly well run, but which for some reason experience a temporary financial slump. Partnerships could thus bail out such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Committee members agree that those are constructive suggestions that would contribute to what is a very welcome Green Paper. I hope too that we and the Scottish Parliament can in due course produce a system of which we can all be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm (Edingburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two parts of today's debate complement each other perfectly. During the first part, an announcement was made about a revolutionary approach to public expenditure based on output. Reference was also made to the steepest ever sustainable increase in the Scottish Office budget. Notwithstanding the new SNP mantra about 1994–95, that increase will lead by the end of this Parliament to the largest ever Scottish Office block, in real terms. If one takes into account the declining population, that block is of course even larger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the second part of today's debate emphasized that it is a matter not merely of spending more money, but of recognising new priorities. The importance that the Government, attach to child care underlines several of our key objectives: child welfare, equal opportunities, economic progress and the tackling of social exclusion. The Government are clearly saying that the men-only economic strategies of the past are no longer acceptable. I sometimes find it hard to believe the speed with which the Government have acted in that policy area, which is one of several that highlight the dramatic changes that a change of Government has brought about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as five years ago this month, I asked the previous Prime Minister about child care, in the context of the lone parent debate at that time. I suggested that financial assistance for child care should be given to lone parents. When he failed to answer my question, as was his wont, I wrote to him. I recently looked again at that correspondence. He made the astounding assertion that research indicated that low-income lone parents do not spend money on child care. That is an amazing statement. We did not need research to tell us that lone parents could not afford to spend money on child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair, some slight progress was made in the limited disregard that the previous Government allowed. However, through the dramatic extension of the relevant child care proposals and, more fundamentally, through the working families tax credit, the Labour Government have revolutionised—if I may use that word for a second time—access to child care not merely for lone parents but for all working parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said that £105 might not be enough. It might not be enough for some people, but it is a dramatic improvement on recent figures. The reality is that parents with one child can receive up to £70, and those with two children can receive up to £105. Those sums will be available to families who are well up the income scale and who are well beyond the current limits determined by family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
That is a massive step forward in improving the affordability of child care. It is also part of a wider picture, which incudes: the working families tax credit, which provides improved in-work support; the unprecedented £2.50 increase in child benefit, which will be paid from next April; and, the £2.50 for all children under 11 in families on income-related benefit, which will be paid from November. That general package will make child care more affordable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's second objective is to increase the availability and improve the supply of child care. Several months ago, a massive expansion in after-school child care places was announced. When the £25 million for Scotland is matched with the new financial support, all families will in the near future—and certainly by the end of this Parliament—be able to afford and after-school child care place, which will be available to them. That revolutionises the prospects for thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of families in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few days, the expansion of places for three-year-olds has been announced, with the commitment to delivering that before the end of this Parliament. That will constitute a quicker than expected increase in nursery places. The child care strategy document explains that that will be built on through the development of integrated early-years services. Other announcements about it will be made before too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Affordability will be improved and accessibility increased, but the key to the child care strategy is the emphasis on quality. It is not an accident—I am sure—that by far the longest section of the child care Green paper is on quality of services. That section contains an enormous range of proposals to increase the quality of child care provision, which must be the cornerstone of the strategy. One or two dissident voices complain that such measures are not good for children, but all the evidence shows that pre-school education, in particular, is very good for children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also assure parents and the wider public about the quality of child care services, for which we have a whole host of measures. More work has to be done and more consultation papers on the subject have been promised, but quality is at the heart of the Government's strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of early-years services is an exciting area to examine in detail. I read recently some research by Helen Penn, who used to be assistant director of education in Stratchclyde. She was instrumental, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson)—who has left the Room—in developing the excellent integrated early-years services in Strathclyde. She is particularly interested in integrated early-years nurseries, which she has observed for her research. I was pleased to meet her recently and she assured me that one of the best centres that she observed—although it is not named in her research paper—is in Scotland; indeed, it is in her former region of Strathclyde. A lot of good practice exists in Scotland and it will be built on as the strategy develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new emphasis on family friendly working and the determination to change the relationship between work and family life, are complementary to the child care strategy. The hon. Member for Moray referred to parents
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
who do not want to go out to work—there is no compulsion to do so. Between the view that parents should spend every hour that is sent at work, and the contrary view that they should spend no hours in paid employment, is the view that a new relationship between work and family life can be developed. That has been highlighted by the new Government. It is a matter partly of creating time off at particular moments for parents and partly of opening up more flexible patterns of working life when parents return to work after the birth of a child. Unlike the previous Government, this Government are implementing the parental leave directive, which gives parents time off at the birth of a child and at any point for urgent family reasons. Unlike the previous Government, we are also implementing the part-time workers directive, which removes the discrimination against part-time workers, and which makes such work more of an option for those who want to combine it with caring responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must create choice in this area. All of the options, including flexi-time, job shares and term-time working are being investigated and promoted by the Government. The Government are determined to disseminate good practice and to set an example in their own areas of responsibility. For instance, the Under-Secretary's health policy has highlighted for the national health service the importance of family-friendly working, and we are assured that appropriate proposals will be produced by next April. A recent survey by the Royal College of Nursing showed that that was a key priority for nurses—about 85 per cent. of them said that it was central to recruitment and retention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should combine that initiative with the working time directive, which will restrict the number of hours that are worked. Financial measures, including the working families tax credit, the child care tax credit and the minimum wage, are also relevant. In some cases, parents have had to work hours that are too long simply from financial necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In only one year, the Government have flagged up a range child care and family-friendly working policies. Their proposals have—I used this work once again—revolutionised the situation. Some people may not associate that word with the new Government, but it is not carelessly used in this context. We have heard far too much nonsense from certain quarters about how the Government are carrying on the previous Government's policies. If people still think that after our two-hour debate this morning, they must have been sleeping or are so deeply prejudiced that they have not heard the arguments. The Government's priorities and the sustainable increases in public expenditure, which are way beyond anything that the previous Government introduced, take us in a new direction. The Government's new priorities reflect those of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also hear nonsense about what is or is not Scotland's party. I regard any claim to be Scotland's party primarily to be a sign of chilling and breathtaking arrogance. If we must discuss what is Scotland's party, I submit that the party that serves the interests of hundreds and thousands of parents in Scotland through child care and family-friendly working strategies has a considerable claim to be serving the interests of the people of Scotland. At the end of the day, that is what really matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members start by saying that one should not claim to be Scotland's party and end by trying to get into that game. All parties that take part in the election and that are supported by the electorate have a role to play and can claim to be one of Scotland's parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm) discussed finance and the letter that he received from the previous Prime Minister. We can talk about choices and different lifestyles and about the need to send signals and to try to support parents in their choices, but some choices will not be available if parents have not got the resources or appropriate work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pursue my intervention on the Under-Secretary's speech. The Secretary of State talked about education spending and the use of nursery places to liberate parents. The Under-Secretary may accept that the Secretary of State has gone a bit far, because at that age children do not want to be forced into classrooms for too long. Nursery places obviously free parents for the time that the child is at the session, but they are there for a relatively short time, in terms of an adult's lifestyle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some parents had problems with the change from the voucher system. They may have used their voucher to buy a session at a nursery that could provide care at each end of the day. That is less disruptive for a child than moving it from one institution to another to enable child care to continue while a parent is at work. When the Minister reports further on wrapping around, I hope that he will bear in mind that that would help parents who want to add child care at each end of the educational element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) referred to transport, which reduces choices in rural areas. In Aberdeenshire the problem has been tackled to some extent by moving nurses around the area to provide sessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments have a greater problem than Oppositions in meeting parents' expectations. In some parts of Grampian region, to enable everyone to have some nursery care, the five sessions a week were reduced to three with the agreement of all the parents, but that caused some problems. In another area, a head teacher was recently confronted by parents who objected that because resources had been made available the number of sessions had been increased from three to five and they did not want their children to be in nursery for five sessions. She persuaded them to experiment with five sessions and to see how their children coped. There is always conflict when changes are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland referred to flexible arrangements to enable families to choose options that suit them. The message must be sent to employers not just in statute but by persuading them that if they train their employees and can provide flexibility during the early years of child care, they will have the benefit of that investment in the long run because they will keep those employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there are two parents, fathers should, if they wish, be able to have a greater role in child care than society has previously accepted. On the advice page of the 	<i>Daily Record</i> today a father who has taken on the role of child care because he was the lower earner complains that he is rejected by the groups with which he is involved
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
when looking after this child and is ridiculed for his decision. We must provide support for fathers who want to take on the care of a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also wears a health hat. Parents are very close to the health service during pregnancy and just after childbirth, when they need support. A child is for life and whatever the age at which children go out into the big wide world, their parents never lose their concern for them. The period during which there is a great demand on parents—before children go to playgroup, nursery or school—is finite. During the first six months to a year, children rapidly develop some independence and parents should be given support to enable them to be involved with their children during that time. If the financial wherewithal is available and if employers are prepared to be flexible and allow jobs to be shared between two parents, the children benefit greatly. The Minister wants to encourage breast feeding, which is a natural method. Milk can be expressed and so on, which can free the mother to some extent. A parent and child should be together in the early months and support should be provided to give children a healthy start, which will benefit them in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good discussion and there is a lot of support for the Government's proposals and for agencies to work together. The password seems to be flexible support that allows parents to build a way forward. We should help parents to recognise that a child is completely vulnerable and dependant for only a short period and we should provide the necessary resources. As the child gets older, resources should be provided for care at a wider level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's recognition that rural areas have unique problems. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute hit the nail on the head and the Minister's response was helpful. If an agency can recognise where the demand is and provide help, people will have the confidence to set up a service and see if it works. The start-up costs are considerable and, if the service does not work, people will have a severe burden. Anything the Minister can do to provide support to help people to maintain their lifestyle in rural communities would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Women's organisations and child care organisations in Scotland will welcome the Government's announcement. The Minister may not welcome the fact that they will beat a path to his door. All members of the Committee will support this comments and those of my hon. Friends the Ministers for Maryhill and for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm). It is great news for Scotland, particularly for child care organisations such as the ones in my constituency, that are excellent providers but concerned about their funding from local authorities. We shall monitor the situation to ensure that those excellent organisations do not lose out in the short term as we move towards the national child care strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the announcement as someone who has spent the past 13 years balancing—it has sometimes been more of a juggling act—work and family life. It has been a financial struggle and with four children I have had to use every form of affordable, good-quality child care—including many excellent child minders. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that the tragic case that finished
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
yesterday must not be allowed to undermine the excellent work of good child minders in Scotland, although we must use it as a lesson to ensure children's safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a national child care strategy that truly reflects the needs of parents and children in Scotland, including provision for children in rural and in ethnic minority communities. I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister's points on that. Child care is not a simple issue. Provision that meets the needs of the child and of the family is required, at the point of need. Issues of quality, affordability, accessibility, voluntry sector involvement, hours of provision, the needs of shift workers, out-of-hours school care and so on are involved—issues that must be addressed strategically, co-ordinated by the Government, but provided by a range of bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without disagreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill, I wish to make a few points on encouraging businesses to face up to the real business case for child care. I commend the publication by Fair Play Scotland, which makes that case and offers employers practical advice for setting up a variety of child care schemes. It outlines the child care options, including on-site nurseries, partnership nurseries, buying places in nurseries and for out-of-school child care, employer vouchers and child care allowances, illustrating them with examples of excellent practice. It is vital that we safeguard those examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business case has to be made on the basis of benefits to the employer, centering on the retention of highly-trained and motivated employees, who are not constantly worried about their children and can therefore perform to the best of their ability. I hope that businesses will participate in the partnership announced this morning. They should contribute financially, to programmes or through their employees, and must be encouraged in that. We must not throw the baby out with the bath water, but must ensure that the best examples of good practice are used to develop the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have long worked for this day can hardly believe that it has arrived. However, we can believe that the strategy is being introduced under a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Pentlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first attempt in Scotland to recognise the need for an integrated child care service and the Minister should be congratulated for that. He has a wide background in health matters that will be helpful in the integration of education, day-care, health and welfare services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By neglecting child care provision, the previous Government ended up spending billions of pounds on the effects of social deprivation and breakdown, including unemployment benefit, drug problems and a rising prison population—one of the highest in Europe. My hon. Friends have not made many criticisms of the previous Government's child care strategy, but we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
to suffer the consequences of that strategy—or lack of it. I congratulate the Minister on his attempt to redress 20 years of neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An impressive example of the effect of nursery education is the US High/Research project, undertaken about 20 years ago. The project was set up in an area with high crime rates and extensive social deprivation. The children in that area were given two years of intensive nursery education to help them find some order in their chaotic lives and to give them the tools to benefit from education. When the result were checked, it was found not only that there had been amazing short-term effects, which showed up in the early stages of primary education, but also that 20 years later the children who had benefited from the project were much less likely to have criminal records than their cohort group. The children involved in the project were more likely to be employed and not to have received welfare payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of that project suggest that money spent at an early stage will produce savings later in other budgets. I urge the Minister to draw to the attention of his colleagues the fact that money on child care is well spent and that such an investment will save money in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed child care strategy does not fit neatly into that of existing Government Departments. It crosses the lines between local government and voluntary associations. We should pay tribute to those local authorities, such as Edinburgh city council, which have been pioneers and have tried to promote child care provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Secretary of State to consider the following examples from my constituency of Edinburgh, Pentlands. There are two projects in community schools: Balerno High and the Wester Hailes Education Centre. Balerno High is a secondary school but provides after school care for children from a number of primary schools in the area. As a community school, it also offers education for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wester Hailes Education Centre has an impressive scheme, providing child care and nursery education for the children of pupils at the school. Indeed, pupils throughout Edinburgh can attend the school if they need to take advantage of those facilities. Youngsters who have had a child before they have completed their education are, therefore, able to get back into the education system. They can not only attend school to further their own education, but during the school day they can visit the nursery to paly with and feed their children. They also receive help from trained nursery teachers. Such early care helps the children, who are much better off than being at home with unemployed, ill-trained and unhappy mothers. The results of the experiment have been impressive, and I commend the scheme to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third project that I commend is the Broomhouse out-of-school care project, which has been funded by Urban Aid. It offers subsidised, cheap and reliable child care to parents in a working-class area. The project fits in with many of the Green Paper's aims. Its hours are designed to fit in with parents' work patterns, and that has helped many of them into work. It also provides an after-school homework support club, which is useful to families who may have poor literacy levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project has been successful and parents have been able to rely on affordable care. The bad news, however, is that funding for the project is now on a year-to-year
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
basis and has been cut from £140,000 to £100,000 a year. One result is that the full breakfast service that the project provided for children whose parents worked very early hours had been cut. That service was important because of the links between diet, nutrition and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad that excellent projects cannot develop because of funding problems. Parents wonder whether they can rely on the provision of care in the future because, naturally, they are worried about what will happen to a scheme. Highly trained staff also feel insecure and they may seek permanent employment with a clear career structure elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instability in family life—at home and in the community—is a major problem in many communities. There are many excellent projects in Scotland, but, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West suggested, insecurity bedevils many of them. Many projects are small and that makes it impossible to develop appropriate career structures to motivate staff. They are also vulnerable to cash crises and lack the specialist infrastructure that is available to larger projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I acknowledge the contribution made by many small projects over the years, there is a need for central Government direction to ensure the dissemination of best practice, cost efficiency and some permanence. The pattern of small, inadequately funded, short-term projects is not helpful. We have had the experiments; now it is time to learn the lessons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In learning the lessons, it is essential that we remember that child care is an investment for the future. Children should be educated at school as early as possible about the responsibilities of child care, parenting, nutrition and health. We should also have a comprehensive research project to evaluate child care provisions to make sure that the next generation of parents in Scotland have access to a system of child care that is among the best in Europe and not at the bottom of the league.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without a shadow of doubt the Government's commitment to developing a Scottish child care strategy must be welcomed. It will give us the first-ever child care strategy for the whole of Scotland, and the consultation process that the Green Paper offers is the best way of achieving quality provision across the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a few brief remarks and to refer in particular to rural areas. I very much envy right hon. and hon. Friends who, because they represent heavily populated urban areas, find child care provision to be less of a problem. The difficulties in rural areas can be overcome only with extra provision backed up by adequate additional financial resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years, rural areas have been offered a wide range of provision through local government, the private sector, the voluntary sector and community-based groups. Everything—from creches to palygroups, nurseries and, more recetnly, after-school and homework groups in the primary schools—has been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray, who fortunately has left the Room, referred to children with special needs. My own experience has demonstrated that when social services make referrals to playgroups and nurseries, it can sometimes cause extreme difficulties, especially in rural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
locations. I am pleased, though, that the Government's proposals will help with special needs in future. It must be emphasised that children with special needs are entitled to the same opportunities as others. That must never be forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposals hould be all-embracing. Irrespective of social background—whether they are unemployed or working—the needs of parents must be met. In the north-west of Dumfries, on the Lochside, Sandside and lincluden estates, thanks to urban-aid funding over several years, we have been able to establish quality crèches, playgroups and after-school care. The facilities have been community-led and have enabled many parents, especially women, to return to work or full-time education. People have seized the opportunities that those quality services have provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Maryhill said, urban-aid funding is coming to an end and those services are now under threat. I can only hope that some of the additional £100,000 allocated to the local authority will find its way to supporting those well-established and excellent projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In more remote or outlying rural areas we have to be realistic about what can be achieved. Yes, we can have playgroups, nurseries and an element of after-school care, but is it possible to provide a crèche in localities that have only a handful of cottages? If we can, well and good; but if we cannot, we must ensure that qualified child minders are availble to provide day-to-day care and assist households seeking such help. Proposals must be dovetailed to meet the needs of local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, our strategy offers long overdue opportunities for which many households have been waiting. The financial incentives offered by the Government, packaged with quality provision, which the strategy will provide, will give the young children of Scotland the start that they rightly deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith said, let us hope that it will be revolutionary. I am conscious that revolutions often end up mired in bureaucracy and fail to deliver to the people the revolutionaries' promises. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] We are committed to ensuring that the revolution is permanent and ongoing in all quarters of society. That remains the role fo the Labour party. It may now be called ideology-free or even new Labour, but it is still about radicalising and changing society, and I hope that that will be carried through in our child care strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the provision of child care, we will see the uptake of benefits by articulate people, already living in a middle-class eenvironment, who are conscious of the potential advantages available to them. However, the people who are presently excluded from work and from the benefits of society are those whom we can best help if we focus our efforts on them. Child care tax credit, family tax vredit and the new dealw ill be of great assistance and provide an opportunity to give economic and social hand-ups to people who have been excluded from the benefits of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the approach of the Government's task froce wil be positive. I can give a name for the quango, a short-term organisation focused on a real purpose. I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
that the task force will take the particular aim that I mentioned into account and that people's aspirations will be raised. People taking that first step into work—not necessarily well paid initially—may begin to aspire to do better for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the news about child care partnerships. The role of private nurseries—of which there are some good examples in and near my constituency—may be threatened if local authorities see themselves as the main driving force and private nurseries as something to be used only when that is unavoidable. That would not be an equal partnership and would result in the loss of some excellent initiatives. I hope that the local government help line will not dish out parochial or dogmatic advice, but will be concerned with building a flexible partnership using the talent in the private sector. The idea of school or nursery-school-based education provision and wrap-around provision at a local private nursery strikes me as attractive. Why should we re-invent the wheel when a strong model already exists?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the initiatives discussed by Helen Penn of Strathclyde, clearly the relevant debate was focused on the nursery, as opposed to educational, issue. I hope that, whatever advice is offered and whatever structure adopted, we do not increase the divide between nursery child care and nursery education. They should work together rather than apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope also that we shall not increase the division between the professional deliverer and the community and family deliverer. An excellent example has been set by Kinneil school in my constituency, which won the national curriculum award for the way in which it involved the community in after-school clubs and the classroom. While building up the professionals' role, we should not downgrade the role of community and family in supporting schools, nursery schools and the child care provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been wide consensus on both sides of the Committee about the merit of the Government's child care strategy and the discussion paper. Now that the Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office has returned to his place, I want to mention his work on early intervention—a valuable part of a child care strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Moray and for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) spoke about children with special educational needs. The child care strategy refers to the discussion paper on those children. Perhaps more can be said about how the Government envisage their pre-school needs being met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One welcome aspect of the matter is that a Minister has responsibility for children's affairs. It is clear to hon. Members, especially those in the all-party group on children, that the fragmentation caused by the fact that different Departments have all had some responsibility for children has always been a problem. Giving one Minister an overall remit is welcome. It would be helpful if that development were to be carried through, particularly with respect to local government and local service provision. Different departments dealing with social work, leisure and recreation, education and perhaps health matters
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
should bring their work together. The requirement under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 for childrens' services plans will encourage that approach. However, perhaps more can be done locally—and, indeed, by the local partnerships that are part of the strategy—to enable services for children to be dealt with as a whole, without the departmentalisation that has affected them until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly welcome the proposals for pre-school education for three-year-olds, building on what has already been established for four-year-olds. I noted what the Minister said about wrap-around, and the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith). That approach brings its own problems and challenges. I was visited at my constituency surgery last week by parents who do not have nursery education on their doorstep. It is supplied by a school some distance away and transport present a problem. Parents want to be involved. They want to escort their children because they feel that they benefit from being in the place where they are getting their pre-school education at some stage during the week. They also make the point that they have been offered five opportunities a week—three mornings and two afternoon sessions—and there is now a curriculum. They do not want their children to lose out but it is difficult for them to make that commitment to drive their children to school some cannot drive—on so many occasions. We will have to look at transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue that has been drawn to my attention is the fact that our school year for admissions tends to go from March round to February. Parents have to decide in June and July whether a child who was born after 31 August starts in August or waits another year. If they have had two years' provision and feel that the child is still not ready to go to school, what will he the position of they want to claim a third year? This will have to be thought through in much more detail, but the school year for admission could now be changed and could run from September to August, given that children will now have two years before they go to school. I would not expect an instant reply to that but it is something that the Minister might want to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point concerns the importance of qualifications. The report emphasises the quality that must be there both in terms of premises and the people who are providing the education and training. I was somewhat concerned by the written answer that I received when I asked what had been done to take forward Lord Cullen's recommendations for the development of a Scottish voluntary qualification for work with children. After describing some of the preliminary work that has been done, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"An SVQ, however, might not in any case be the most suitable approach to training for a sector with a high incidence of volunteers."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 May 1988; Vol. 321, c. 	<i>384</i>]</p></q>
Perhaps the Minister could explain what lies behind that because it rings some alarm bells that the quality and standards to be reached may not be what most of us thought. We thought that some standard would have to be reached. Instead we are told that a consultation paper on various options for training will be issued shortly. Perhaps he can tell us when that will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also emphasise the importance of diversity and choice. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West said that whether to return to work was a fundamental choice. People who want to go to work should be able to choose that option. People who do not want to go to work should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
not feel that they are under a financial compulsion to do so. For a parent bringing up a child, not going to work is a perfectly legitimate option. Likewise provision should not be solely educational. We need the diversity of different types of child care, including after school clubs, child minders and numerous other types of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two final points. I emphasise what the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) said about trying to encourage businesses to play their part. The Government should look at ways in which the tax regime might encourage small businesses to come together to make provision for child care. Has the Minister considered involving someone who is not long out of school, or even in the final years of school, and who has the most recent experience of child care in a board such as the Scottish child care board? The lists of partners includes every conceivable partner except young people and they have something to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, lottery funds are to be distributed under the new opportunities fund. It worries me that those who already have a good provision also have the wherewithal to put together the good, attractive bid whereas those in the most need do not. Can the Minister therefore assure us that when the bids are looked at there will be a clear direction towards those with the greatest need and not those who can make the most attractive presentation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to everyone who has taken part in the debate. We started out on the basis of building on the consensus that had been developed over the years by my hon. Friends. Apart from latter day new testament prophets such as Gerald Warner that proceeded well. It has been continued today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland raised a number of points and I shall try to deal with them and as many others as I can get through in the time. We must consult on qualifications and training. When we discussed it with the various qualification agencies and bodies involved, the SVQ was not considered the way forward although it clearly has a role. Many folk are involved here. We are looking for a ladder of qualifications, which deals with the career structures that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Dr. Clark) mentioned. Those career structures could enable someone to move from the lowest rung to becoming a primary or a secondary schoolteacher. We are trying to establish a system that includes a career structure and provides a high quality care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland made a point that was raised by other hon. Members, for example, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith. They said that we should not target the middle class and those who could gain access easily. We have avoided that. Tax credits are aimed at those on the lower end of the income scale to ensure that they get the money to generate demand. We have introduced other tax changes and will also put large sums of money into family centres, which will usually be located in deprived areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new directions for lottery funding allow areas to be specified. Money from the new opportunities fund must be invested in deprived areas. Local child care partnerships will examine, develop and help local authority initiatives. I hope that we have been able to concentrate on the matter, and ensure that the policy does not affect only one area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
I was grateful for the appreciation of the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland of joined-up government and of giving a Minister responsibility for children. Social inclusion is part of joined-up government, which is our policy. Problems are not vertical, but horizontal, and affect several Departments. We have made a significant start in dealing with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray asked about classroom assistants. They will not replace teachers. They will be trained—we are discussing that with colleges and unions—but I emphasise that they will not replace teachers. They will have other duties, many of which will be administrative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also made a point that my learned Friend the Member for Dumfries and others raised about difficulties in rural areas. The Scottish child care board will discuss the matter. Perhaps child minders constitute a solution to the problem in rural areas more than they do in cities. We hope that we can tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray also said that our strategy concentrated on those who went to work, not those who stayed at home. That is partly true. We want to offer women and men flexibility to choose their lifestyle in a changing society. There has been a huge increase and development in the scope and availability of child care places. Those places will be available to those who choose to stay at home, and will enhance their children's social and intellectual development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were asked about employers. That aspect of the programme requires further development. We have contributed extra money to the fair play scheme. Paul Edwards of Motorola is on the Scottish child care board to try to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West did not want the partnership to be dominated by local authorities. Local authorities have to establish the partnerships, but they should not dominate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned the importance of wrap-around care, which would involve all sectors. We intend to achieve that. It has already happened with provisions for the pre-school year.

	<div class='title'>Skye Bridge</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</p>
	<p>1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Skye and Inverness, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that we have the opportunity to revisit the long-running and vexed issue of the Skye bridge project in general, and the contract and toll rate in particular, before the House rises for the summer recess. Since the general election there have been three significant developments, which, although the subject of oral exchanges between the Secretary of State and me in the House, we have been unable to explore more fully until today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first development is the toll reduction order that the Government introduced following the general election; the second the National Audit Office report, and the third—most recently and most dramatically—the subsequent report from the Public Accounts Committee of the House which considered the history, financing and ministerial and official decisions made about the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal processes are continuing in the Scottish legal system. I appreciate that aspects that are already under examination in the Court of Session in Edinburgh are technically sub judice for the purposes of the debate, and suspect that the Minister and I must tread with some care in any references to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary, and worth while, that we have this debate now, although it must be said that the Scottish Office has shown a marked reluctance to have a debate at all. As long ago as 3 July last year the Secretary of State, when announcing his intention to introduce a reduced toll order, said in a written answer to me:—
	<br><q><p>"The timing of these changes will depend partially on the need to promote a variation to the Toll Order, which will have to be approved by Parliament, and on the need to complete the discussions with the Company."[	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 July 1997; Vol. 297, c. 	<i>290.</i>]</p></q>
Those discussions took some time. The toll order eventually came at the end of last year, at which point two toll orders were tabled. I prayed against both. I have had two subsequent discussions with the Secretary of State to seek a formal debate on the Toll orders but none has been forthcoming, which is regrettable. In due course, the Scottish Office will have to provide a published response to the Public Accounts Committee's report, which itself will be subject to a debate in the usual way later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office was reluctant to have a further debate, one of its arguments being that the toll order was subject to the negative resolution procedure—in other words, it is legal unless there is successful objection in the House. But negative resolutions should be used only where there is a weakening of the original order. The Scottish Office argues that the revised orders represent a weakening because they propose a welcome reduction in the original toll imposition. However, as the Public Accounts Committee mentioned, and as has otherwise been argued, the new discounts, welcome though they are, apply only if one is able to buy up front a book of 20 tickets, all of which must be used within 12 months of purchase. Local residents and tourists who may be only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
occasional users of the bridge are unlikely to shell out for a full book of tickets covering 12 months—and it should be noted from the original available figures that tourists and occasional users constitute the majority of the bridge's traffic. So, for both technical and practical parliamentary reasons discovered since the change in the regime earlier in the year, the Government have, in my view, a moral obligation to institute during this session—perhaps at the changeover in the autumn—a proper debate on the revised toll orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more recent development is the Public Accounts Committee's report, which reached three main conclusions. The first was:
	<br><q><p>"A better comparison of alternative options was needed".</p></q>
That was in reference to the Skye bridge contract as a whole. The report's second main conclusion was that
	<br><q><p>"Toll payers' interests were insufficiently protected".</p></q>
Its third conclusion was that
	<br><q><p>"The financial terms of the deal were not fully satisfactory".</p></q>
Since the election I have said repeatedly that Ministers are not to blame for the mess that they have inherited. If one thinks back to Adjournment debates in Committee under the previous Government, and recalls the comments of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Michael Forsyth and others, one can see the extent to which incompetents make ideology. Conservative Ministers' handling of the matter contributed to an extremely unsatisfactory deal for the public and for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The damming report of the Public Accounts Committee concluded that
	<br><q><p>"the terms on which the bridge has been provided, including the real rate of return to equity investors in the project of 18.4 per cent. a year were not determined competitively".</p></q>
I am sure that we would all like to go to a casino in which a return of 18.4 per cent. was guaranteed, whether a red or black roulette ball came up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Committee also concluded that it was not possible to be satisfied that the costs of the bridge were reasonable. It went on to question
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"whether value for money" had been obtained.
	<br><q><p>"for the taxpayers as well as the toll payers".</p></q>
"Advisers advise and Ministers decide", as a lady once famously said downstairs. However, on this occasion—and I have never said such a thing in 15 years as a Member of Parliament—I believe that former and present Scottish Office Ministers in considering the Public Accounts Committee report must ask hard questions of officials and of civil servants. It is clear from oral evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee by officials and by civil servants that, in the private or the corporate sector senior heads would have rolled for decisions taken and for gross misuse of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the National Audit Office report. National Audit Office figures were based on the developer's financial model. However, that model differs substantially from the figures in the accounts of Skye Bridge Ltd. The financial model shows the developer's input for 1991 as £12.3 million. The audited accounts show that the developer's contribution for that year as £0.6 million. That is a significant discrepancy by any measure of accounting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
procedures. For 1991–96 the financial model, which was accepted by the National Audit Office, gives the developer's costs as £27.3 million, but the audited accounts show the costs for the same period as £19.3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the model overplays the developer's contribution, it underplays the cost to the taxpayer. The model shows the taxpayer's contribution for 1991–96 as £10.6 million. However, the actual contribution revealed by the accounts is £11.6 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not be appropriate to question the accuracy of the NAO figures in today's debate. However, it is a cause for concern—which is shared, I am sure, by the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, the hon. Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish)—that the National Audit Office accepted the developer's projected figures, rather than checking the actual accounts. The developer's figures seem to have been seriously inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unsurprisingly, the National Audit Office seems to be as confused as everyone else by the mire that the funding of the Skye bridge has become. Figure 10 on page 45 of the NAO report gives construction costs as £20 million. However, figure 13 on page 49 gives those costs as £27.3 million. There is a cast-iron case for the complete re-examination of the funding of the project. Despite the analysis that has taken place, there is still considerable confusion and uncertainly about which figures are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to collect tolls is currently before the Scottish courts, therefore, we cannot explore the matter to any great extent in Committee. However, funding was the basis of the contract and a serious legal case is now under way about technical issues such as statements of assignation and concessionaires. Whether a proper legal regime exists for the collection of the tolls reflects a fundamental aspect of the fiasco, and should be of great concern to the Government. Indeed, Professor Robert Black of Edinburgh university, who is something of an authority on such matters in Scottish legal circles, has given his opinion that the document produced in court by the Crown does not give the right to collect the tolls to Miller Civil Engineering. The author of the document presumably agrees with that analysis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what the hon. Gentleman says and in appreciate the legal implication of what has been discussed in the context of the toll. Given the strength of opinion of local residents—the regular users of the bridge—can he find any justification for the writing-off of debt in respect of the Humber bridge, which was drawn to our attention by campaigners? Users of the Humber bridge pay £2.50 while users of the Skye bridge pay £11.20 in tolls. That seems ridiculous. Why have the Government confined the writing-off of debt to one area and not made a concession in respect of the Skye bridge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady and her party for their support over the years in this saga. She is correct to talk about the inequity that is highlighted by the Humber bridge. By means of a written answer a couple of weeks ago, the Government wrote off £62 million in debt arising from the Humber bridge—heaven knows how much that project has cost
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
the taxpayer over the past 25 years—and interest payments on a further £119 million were reduced. I tabled further questions to the Scottish Office and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on that matter, but have not yet received a reply. Perhaps a reply will be given today. It is odious to compare what has been done about the Skye bridge since the election with what has been done in respect of the Humber bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that there is no alternative to the private finance initiative, of which the Skye bridge was a forerunner, and about which the present Government are enthusiasts. The National Audit Office figures show that £18 million of taxpayer's money went into the project. The figure can be broken down as follows: £12 million was spent on approach roads and construction, £3 million was spent on advisers and survey fees and the cost of the discounted tolls regime since the election has been £3 million. As Caledonian MacBrayne lost £1 million a year in ferry revenues during the construction phase of the bridge a total of about £22 million could have been available from the public purse had we pursued a proper route, rather than the forerunner PFI route, which has proved so costly to my constituents and to the public purse. I would therefore like to know whether the Scottish Office has done detailed costings of buying out the contract once and for all. Such confusion and uncertainty surrounds the contract, the figures provided from various sources and the advice given to the Secretary of State—which seems to contradict some of the other findings of the Public Accounts Committee and the NAO—that the Scottish Office must revisit this issue as a matter of urgency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken many times before—I will not do so today—of the social impact of the toll bridge, its unpopularity, and the sense of injustice that many people feel about the way in which it has been foisted on them. However, it is worth saying that the imposition of such a structure is bound to provide disincentive to the local economy. it is also worth pointing out to the Minister that the annual cost of administering the toll regime is phenomenal—nearly £800,000 per annum just to collect and administer the toll regime. How does that make sense from the point of view of the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the general election, the Labour party made great play of the fact—not least in my neck of the woods—that it would take action on the toll regime. The mood music for that was quite clear. Carefully crafted words were used, and some action has been taken, which is certainly welcome, but the mass of evidence shows that there is a need for a proper independent inquiry into the whole contact, with a view to the eventual abolition of the tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party inherited a situation that was not of its own making. It has tried to redress the problems, but the volume of evidence since the general election has been so great that it would be fully justified in going further in responding to the concerns expressed, not least by the Public Accounts Committee, and to the desire of local people who want a bridge that operates on the same basis as any other structure in Scotland. The local people of Skye and Lochalsh do not want the monopolistic, high-toll regime that has been foisted on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I endorse and support everything that the hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy) said. I, too, remember the highland candidates whose leaflets referred to the private finance initiative as being the cancer of privatisation. They gave a strong commitment on what would happen if a Labour Government were elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme was approved in 1992. Here we are in 1998 and the questions that have been raised time and again by the hon. member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West and others have still not been answered. Since the election, however, the Government have approved eight PFI schemes. Many questions that worry the general public can be resolved only by holding an inquiry into what happened. If an inquiry is established as a result of all the information that has been received, it must be genuinely independent and offer a clear resolution to the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy) on his success in obtaining this debate on the Skye bridge. I know that the issue has generated a great deal of discussion, controversy and emotion. As the Minister responsible for roads and transport, I have taken a close interest in developments. I am grateful for the opportunity to put on the record the Government's position on the project and, in so doing, respond to some of the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, however, I should like to reflect on the situation in Skye that existed prior to the opening of the bridge. At that time, the people of Skye were served by a ferry service that was often delayed or weather disrupted and which was increasingly unable to cope with the amount of traffic. That frequently led to the build up of long queues and a great deal of frustration. The building of a bridge to Skye has solved those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has recognised that the Skye bridge project is not of this Government's making. The bridge emerged as a result of much local pressure for a fixed crossing to the island and out of the recognition that a bridge was needed at the earliest opportunity to promote the area's economic potential through improved transport and communications. It was widely recognised at the time that the existing ferries were not able to cope with the level of traffic growth and that that would harm the development of Skye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Highland regional council, the body responsible for the road, could not afford to finance the crossing from its annual roads budget and pressed the Scottish Office to provide a fixed crossing to Skye. The council, after undertaking local consultation and being satisfied that there was sufficient consensus for it to proceed, voted overwhelmingly for the Scottish Office to take the project forward under PFI. The previous Government argued that the bridge would not have been built using public funds for at least 20 years and that it should be developed as one of the earliest PFI projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
The bridge is owned by the Secretary of State but, as I have already stated, it would not have been built without the use of private finance hence the concession agreement with Skye Bridge Ltd. Without PFI, local people and tourists alike would have continued to pay the ferry fares with no prospect of those fares coming to an end. They would also have been subjected to the delays associated with the ferry service which I have already outlined. By contrast, the local community is now enjoying substantial benefits from having a continuous all-weather link to the mainland. Even before the toll reductions made by the present Government, it was benefiting from tolls which are, with one minor exception, lower in real terms than the previous ferry fares, and from significantly shorter journey times. Reliability is much improved, and congestion and delay have been eliminated. Local people can cross more quickly and reliably without long delays, and for no more money than the cost of the ferry. On current estimates, the concession will end by 2013—the exact date depends on usage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the bridge protesters obtained the publicity, some members of the largely silent majority on Skye have acknowledged those benefits in correspondence with Ministers. The letters have assured us that a very large body of opinion in Skye accepts that the bridge has been a boon to the economy and is appreciative of the Government's achievements in reducing tolls for frequent users. The correspondence also suggests that a majority of the population of Skye recognises the project's long-term benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic crossing statistics for the bridge bear out such sentiments. During the first full year of operation the number of crossings was 16 per cent. higher than ferry crossings in the previous year. Bus traffic, including tourist coaches, rose by approximately 38 per cent. during that time. Figures for the second full year after opening, to October 1997, show an overall increase of 1.6 per cent. on the first year levels. Since October traffic has increased further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the benefits that the bridge has clearly brought, we recognised that it has aroused much strong feeling, particularly on Skye and in the surrounding areas. We acknowledged that strength of feeling last year by making our manifesto commitment to examine the Skye bridge tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our pledge was a responsible one, and I can categorically state that it was fulfilled—immediately after our election victory we set up a wide-ranging review of tolls, through which we considered all options. In examining the outcome of that review, issues of affordability had to be taken into account. We do not have a bottomless pit of money. Our decision had to be weighed against other priorities, such as education and health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those considerations led us to decide that the only affordable and fair option was to reduce prices for regular users, who are affected most by the tolls. We have reduced discounted tolls for regular users by 50 per cent. for cars and motorcycles, and by 25 per cent. for commercial vehicles and public service buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That significant package of reductions came into effect from 1 January 1998. Regular car users who buy a book of discounted tickets now pay only £1.30 per crossing. That is about 60 per cent. lower than the equivalent 1995 fare, which was £3.10. That has to be good news for the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Crossings figures for the bridge bear out the popularity of the new measures. During the first six months of 1998, 16.8 per cent. more discounted tickets were used than in the same period for 1997. Overall traffic was 6.4 per cent. higher, and seven out of 10 crossings by car during the first three months were by discounted tickets. That counters claims that regular users are worse off, and that the majority cannot afford to buy discounted books of 20 tickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the reduced tolls falls on the Scottish trunk roads programme, and displaces some other priorities. We have already paid about £240,000 to the concessionaire; the annual payment for 1998 is expected to be approximately £550,000. We have confirmed the continuation of that arrangement in the comprehensive spending review, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland announced today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister—for the majority the revised toll order is affordable. However, a signficant minority might be genuinely disadvantaged by having to pay up front for 20 tickets that must be used within 12 months. I hope that the Scottish Office will consider the matter when it responds to the Public Accounts Committee report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a constructive point. We want to monitor the situation. If the hon. Gentleman brings outstanding problems to my attention I will always be willing to examine them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been recent claims that we could have got out of the Skye bridge contract with little financial pain, but that we chose not to do so. The review findings of last July clearly showed that the cost of buying out the contract would have been about £30 million. That figure was not plucked from the air but carefully calculated in the light of the commitments in the signed agreements. Some protesters have claimed that there is no need to honour legal commitments, or even to stick to Government accounting rules, but we cannot accept that. The fact remains that the significant package of reductions that we have implemented was the only affordable option, and represented the fairest way of alleviating the burden on those most affected by the tolls.

Soon after the Labour Government took office the Lord Advocate, who is totally independent of the Government, examined the practice of prosecuting non-payment cases as a matter of course. As early as July 1997 he announced that he saw no reason to treat such cases differently from other minor offences. Accordingly, he instructed the procurator fiscal to use his discretion in deciding whether or not to proceed in all outstanding and future cases. Following on from that decision, the concessionaire denied passage to those refusing to pay tolls. As a result, I am pleased to say that no new non-payment cases by toll protesters have been reported to the procurator fiscal since July 1997.

The Public Accounts Committee has conducted a full examination of the procurement and tolling arrangements of the Skye bridge and the Department will examine its recommendations before responding to its published
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
report in the normal way. That being the case, it is obviously not currently appropriate for me to comment in detail on its contents, and I do not have the time to do so. I welcome, however, the PAC's recognition of the important role that public and private partnerships can play in delivering public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been calls from some quarters for the establishment of a public inquiry into the Skye bridge following on from the publication of the report. Both the National Audit Office and the PAC have now conducted detailed examinations of all aspects of the bridge, and I see no need for such an inquiry. The important fact is that we are currently dealing with the PAC's response, and we hope to make our views known in September. That will be another occasion on which we may be able to discuss the relevant issues. As was pointed out earlier, the PAC's deliberations in the House provide further occasions for such debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PAC conducted a full examination of the Department's handling of the project. Its report was critical of some of the judgments that the Department reached and those criticisms will be responded to in the Treasury minute in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the report does not make any criticisms of individuals and there is no suggestion of personal negligence or incompetence. I have no reason to believe that officials did not act properly and in accordance with the rules prevailing at the time. Calls for heads to roll are therefore inappropriate.

The NAO estimates that over the expected life of the concession—it has a probable 12 to 16 years to run—the payment by the Scottish Office will be equivalent to a total of between £2.8 million and £3.4 million at 1991 prices. The figures are on the same price basis as the £23.64 million figure of total tolls which can be collected by Skye Bridge Ltd. before the concession ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deal will not increase the total revenue that the concessionaire can collect. The issue raised by the PAC is whether it will benefit from increased profits, which are due to reaping the benefits of extra traffic that may be generated by the reductions, so shortening the life of the concession. We set out to put SBL in as nearly as practicable the same position as it would have been had there been no change, as required by our binding agreements with it. In order to limit the possibility of it benefiting from increased traffic, we introduced a payment cap of £600,000 per year at 1996 traffic flows and prices. That payment cap will increase on the basis of a formula that takes account of traffic growth and inflation. The mechanism was, therefore, intended precisely to limit SBL gaining additional profits.

There has been suggestion that the Humber bridge is being given preferential treatment. I should stress that the funding arrangements in place at the Humber and Skye bridges are entirely different.

Only £62 million—the debt owed to the Public Works Loan Board—is being paid off. The £359 million debt owed to the Secretary of State is being restructured, but it still falls to be paid within the next 40 years of tolling. I must stress that tolls will therefore continue at their current levels during this period. In comparison, it is expected that the concession on the Skye bridge will end by 2013.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been suggestions that the burden of tolls on the Skye bridge should be reduced further. As I have pointed out, we have already introduced a considerable

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
package of measures, which are, aimed at reducing the cost of the bridge. I firmly believe, therefore, that substantial steps have already been taken to reduce the burden of tolls on the people of Skye.

I thank the hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West for initiating the debate. It have given me the chance to set out the Government's position on some of the important issues that have been raised. Despite the controversy, we must not forget that, in our view, the lives of local people have been significantly improved by the increased accessibility that is offered by the fixed link.

We continue to believe that public and private sectors working in partnership can provide much of value to the people of this nation. However, lessons have been—and are being—learned, and I have no doubt that they will inform future projects and help to secure fairness and value for money for the taxpayer, improved local services for the people who will benefit from them, and, we hope, transparent deals that will be open to the scrutiny of the House and the new Scottish Parliament when it is established in Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
