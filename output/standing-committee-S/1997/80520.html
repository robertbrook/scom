	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is scheduled to finish at 7 o'clock, and I appeal to hon. Members, including Front Benchers, to make brief contributions. That will enable me to call as many speakers as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to introduce our debate on higher and further education provision in Scotland. It will be useful to have a debate at this time. In the last year of the previous Parliament, I introduced an Adjournment debate on higher education, and the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) introduced a lively Wednesday morning Adjournment debate on further education. Since then, we have witnessed the important publication of the Dearing and Garrick reports, and the Government's response to them. The Teaching and Higher Education Bill has also gone through the House of Lords and has been considered in Committee in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, there has been no opportunity until now for Scottish Members of the House of Commons to debate such issues. It is a matter of some regret that there were no Scottish Members on the Committee that considered the Teaching and Higher Education Bill, although no one should cast blame. That was a lost opportunity. Those who have read today's Order Paper will have seen that my hon. Friends and I have tabled a motion before Report stage, asking that the Bill be recommitted to a Scottish Standing Committee so that Scottish Members can examine the clauses that deal with Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman was surprised that there was no Scottish representation during the Standing Committee's important consideration of the Bill, because the Liberal representative on the Select Committee on Selection chose not to put a Scottish representative on that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather hope that the tone of our debate will be more dignified than that cheap comment. Perhaps we should have had a referendum about who served on the Committee. At least our party has taken the initiative. I hope that the Scottish National party, and, indeed, the Government, will support our request that the Bill be recommitted to a Scottish Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will agree that this is an important issue—not least because of the role that our universities and further education colleges play in the individual development of thousands of young and not-so-young Scots, as well as that of many students from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
outwith Scotland. It is also important because we shall need those institutions to develop and teach the skills and to build the knowledge and research base that will ensure that Scotland remains competitive well into the next century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a useful debate because it provides an opportunity to acknowledge the remarkable achievements of those who have been engaged in teaching and learning in Scotland's higher and further education establishments in recent years—years of considerable financial difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government's publication "Serving Scotland's Needs" shows, the number of full-time equivalent students in FE colleges increased from 78,000 in 1993–94 to 92,600 in 1997–98. In higher education institutions, the number of full-time equivalent students—undergraduates and postgraduates —increased from 117,000 in 1993–94 to 124,000 in 1996–97. The Garrick report confirms that participation in higher education continues to run at about 10 per cent. above the United Kingdom average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures also take account of the fact that 12,700 students from other parts of the United Kingdom crossed into Scotland to study at higher education institutions. That matter will be important when the Committee discusses the impact of tuition fees, especially in relation to students in the fourth year of an honours degree, who will not benefit from having their fees paid. The increase in numbers has been no small achievement, against a background of financial stringency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reminding ourselves of the contribution that Scottish higher education makes to the Scottish economy. I am sure that many Committee members are familiar with the report published two years ago by the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals, which dealt with figures calculated by Professor McNicoll. They showed that in 1993–4, the total Scottish sectoral goods output generated by the higher education sector was £2.47 billion. Of that output, £1.2 billion came from higher education institutions, and £1.27 billion was dependent on higher education but generated by other sectors. Some 68,217 jobs were involved—that is a remarkable figure. I hope that the Committee will remember those figures when it considers the impact of the financial squeeze on further and higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of the Dearing and Garrick reports is the concept of a compact between higher education institutions, students, employers, society and the state. That compact not only restores rights; it requires responsibilities and duties. The Government's immediate response to the reports has been to focus attention on the contribution that students will make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be irresponsible for any politician to think that students in further and higher education could be funded on the basis on which student funding operated 20 years ago, when I was at university—just about. Nobody believes that that is possible now. Even before the Dearing report was published, Liberal Democrats were committed to a fair income-contingent loan scheme as a replacement for maintenance grants. We also believe that it is necessary to increase the loan to tackle student poverty. We are still only too aware that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
many students are in poverty, and that they have to divert time from their studies in order to earn extra income and make ends meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrats oppose undergraduate fees, and we have done so during the passage of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill. I know that the Minister will repeat what he has said many times. I do not think that anybody has challenged the figure that he cites. He says that 40 per cent. of undergraduates will not pay. The other side of that coin is that 60 per cent. of students will pay up to £1,000. People on the very lowest incomes will almost certainly know that they fall into that 40 per cent., but some people at the margins will not know whether they will have to contribute to fees, which could be a disincentive. Families who are not especially well off are especially anxious about that. Such families will not know whether they will be liable to pay fees until the potential student has applied and gone through means-testing. Many people will never quite get round to doing that, or will feel that they cannot bring themselves to put in a student application, because of the potential costs. I hope that a study can be undertaken to identify the extent to which that may happen, because it might never be known. The Minister is nodding—perhaps he will say more later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Friday, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) and I visited a further education institution in Edinburgh. We met a number of principals and vice-principals, who said that institutions were considering all sorts of ways of raising funds because of the current financial squeeze. They are considering marking up the charges for replacing a matriculation card, charging for photocopying, and charging for paper on which students print out information downloaded from the internet. Such charges are not means-tested. They will clearly fall on students who pay no fees as much as on those who pay—and they will not help to improve the relationship that should exist between a college and its students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fees also incur the additional problem of administration costs. We were told that, as £1,000 was a fairly worthwhile debt, proper collection machinery would be necessary. But not all debts will be so large; some will be only £400, and broken up into instalments. Collection of such fees will require considerable administration. Glasgow university has estimated that once the system is established, administration will cost £171,000, and Edinburgh university has put the figure at nearer £180,000. So, at a time when our institutions face financial pressure, additional administrative burdens are being placed on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one additional, parenthetical observation about tuition fees, and give credit where credit is due. The Minister's recent announcement about the cover that is to be given to part-time students in higher education is an especially welcome step forward. However, will he say what consideration is being given to extending that cover, which does not include the further education sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additional to the question of fees is the matter of the contribution to be made by students. I hope that the Government will keep their side of the compact, as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
there is a clear problem about higher education in the short term. In real terms, in England there will be a rise in funding per student in the coming academic year of 0.1 per cent. from the 1997–98 level. In contrast, funding in Scotland will be reduced by 2.7 per cent. In spite of Dearing, in spite of Garrick, in spite of the anticipated income from contributory fees and of the serious financial difficulties already faced by the Scottish higher education sector, the problem—the crisis—in funding will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dearing report asserted that the maximum tolerable efficiency gain was 1 per cent., beyond which quality would decline. Some universities are worried that they will be unable to meet agreed salary increases because of the squeeze on finances. That would put Scottish higher education institutions at a disadvantage compared with their equivalents in England and Wales. The Government's refusal to accept the 1 per cent. maximum on efficiency gains identified by Dearing must inevitably lead to damaging pressures on Scotland's higher education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent will the savings arising from the change from maintenance grants to loans and the additional revenue from student contributions to fees be recycled and reinvested in the higher education sector? A letter to the Association of University Teachers (Scotland) from the Secretary of State, quoted in the submission to the comprehensive spending review by the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals, gave a hint as to the answer. It stated that the new arrangements
	<br><q><p>"in the longer term ֵ will produce around £140 million extra in Scotland",</p></q>
and added that
	<br><q><p>"this will resolve concerns about underfunding of our mass higher education systems and mean that we can achieve our objectives for higher and further education."</p></q>
However, the letter does not appear to state that all the money will be reinvested. It would be reassuring if the Minister could give a clear and categorical commitment that the savings made and the revenue raised will be reinvested in our higher education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the Government's decision to make no concession on fees to students from other parts of the United Kingdom who wish to study for a fourth year—a matter that has been discussed at some length already in an Adjournment debate introduced by the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh). I shall not dwell on it, but I believe that the four-year course has always reflected the breadth of the traditional Scottish educational system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, the Minister has hinted that the assumption is that English and Welsh students, having completed A levels, will want to enter at year 2. Yet experience suggests that that applies to only 10 or 15 per cent. of such students, and in a limited number of subjects—mainly in maths. Even with regard to Scottish-based students who receive funding, anxiety has been expressed to me by the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals that the new advanced higher might increasingly take on the characteristics of a Scottish A-level. That is a matter for concern, because only 8 to 10 per cent. of pupils are in a position to progress with their advanced highers and not all schools are able to offer a comprehensive range of subjects.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Previous signals from the Scottish Office indicated that advanced highers would cover a broad range of subjects. Students are now expected to deal with a narrow range of subjects, and that is more akin to the A-level than to the broad-based Scottish education system with which we are familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in England are currently looking to the broad-based Scottish education system to assess how the A-level system can be improved. Information from employers shows that they are increasingly attracted by graduates with a broad range of experience, and universities are responding to that by revitalising general three-year degrees. It would therefore be detrimental to the Scottish system to change it at such a time. The advanced higher should not be used as the stalking horse for a Scottish A-level. Will the Minister give us an assurance that the advanced higher will continue to be part of the broad-based Scottish education system, and will not become the precursor to a Scottish A-level?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research is key to the issue of funding and higher education. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has a ratio of teaching to research that is loaded far more towards teaching than is the case south of the border, despite the fact that 15 per cent. of the United Kingdom's university research is carried out in Scotland, which has only 11 per cent. of the UK's university population. That ratio, which has widened over the past year, puts pressure on research budgets. Many higher education institutions have made considerable efforts, with some success, to attract commercial funding. They have also experienced pressure—possibly greater pressure than that experienced by institutions that are engaged in basic research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maintenance of a high-quality research base in Scotland is of great importance to the Scottish economy. The Minister will not need a reminder of that. During Question Time yesterday he mentioned the example of Cadence, which all hon. Members should welcome as being typical of the kind of investment that can occur as a result of the high quality of Scotland's research base. That type of development is under pressure due to lack of funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Fife)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has obviously conducted some research in preparation for today's debate. He referred to a meeting that he held on Friday. Is he aware of any Scottish university or college principal having spoken in favour of tuition fees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any that have done so, but that does not mean that there have been none. Certainly, no one has personally expressed that view to me. However, if any such people exist the Minister will no doubt have quotes from them in his brief that he will be only too willing to read out. I suspect that they would be expressing a minority view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking as someone who has carried out university research, albeit some years ago, surely the hon. and learned Gentleman is not suggesting that graduate research programmes are declining in Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
universities? I have been informed that the applications for such graduate programmes are as high as they have ever been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened to me carefully he would know that I did not say that applications were declining. I said that the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council funding ratio of teaching to research is more skewed towards teaching in Scotland than is the case south of the border, and that that ratio has widened over the past year. My point was not that graduate research programmes are declining, but that there is pressure on research funds. The people to whom I spoke were ringing alarm bells about that. It is another problem that has arisen from the current crisis in higher education funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By way of the merest aperitif regarding support for tuition fees, I shall point out that the idea that tuition fees should be introduced was integral to the Garrick and Dearing reports. Moreover, Professor John Arbuthnott, the principal of Strathclyde university, was one of the members of the Garrick committee. Even more interestingly, I refer the hon. and learned Gentleman to the report of the independent Commission on Scottish Education, which was published in 1996. It stated categorically:
	<br><q><p>"Students should … contribute a fixed proportion of their course tuition fees, preferably under arrangements akin to those applying in Australia."</p></q>
I shall keep the membership of the commission for later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned Australia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The commission mentioned it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister quoted the commission, which mentioned Australia. He will know that many people are concerned about what has happened in Australia. There, the threshold was crossed and the political flak taken in order to establish tuition fees, but those fees have since increased considerably. They are now around £8,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not care who is on the commission. When he spoke on the Second Reading of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) warned that once we break through the political barrier of tuition fees, those fees could well go up. Other colleagues have given the same warning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Alexander 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I should like to carry on. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Oh, all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee turns its attention to Scottish further education, I should like to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman whether, during his extensive research prior to today's debate, he became aware of the pioneering work that Paisley university, which is in my constituency, is undertaking to ensure that opportunities for higher education are extended to groups in society that have no previous experience of it? In the light of the hon. and learned Gentleman's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
comments on student funding, did he also discover that along with that pioneering work, the university managed a 9 per cent. increase in applicants this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been to Paisley university in the last couple of months—not in the context of today's debate—and I was aware of the work that it is doing. The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) mentioned the increase in the number of applications during Scottish questions. I should be interested to know what the principal of Paisley university thinks of tuition fees; perhaps the hon. gentleman will be able to tell us if he manages to catch your eye, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education is not completely discrete from higher education. Some 25 per cent. of all Scottish higher education provision is conducted through further education colleges. Perhaps I can pick up on what the hon. Member for Paisley, South said about Paisley university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen an increase in recent years in the numbers of people in further education in Scotland. We have a network of colleges right around Scotland, from Shetland to Dumfries and Galloway. They provide easier access for people into further and, indeed, higher education. They do outreach work with young people, to those who have perhaps left school without qualifications but who now want to obtain some, to adult returners, and to the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will want to comment on one of the questions that arose in correspondence and discussions—namely, the role of further education colleges in the delivery of the new deal. The colleges believe that they have a constructive role to play. They are key players in delivering lifelong learning and meeting the training needs of the community and local employers.

However, FE colleges also have a funding problem. The Minister was quoted as saying that the Government have spent £8 million more than planned in the current year, but that still represents a £3 million cut in what was spent last year. The National Audit Office report, which was published earlier this month, showed that 39 out of the 46 colleges were expected to be in deficit at the end of March of this year. They can no longer rely on capital grants, so where is the money for capital expansion to come from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make progress so that the Minister and other hon. Members can speak. The association of scottish colleges reckons that £25 million extra will be needed to maintain current levels of activity as well as delivering new Government initiatives and facilitating renewed expansion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was concern about distribution and the fact that the method by which grant in aid is calculated makes it difficult to plan in the short term and almost impossible in the medium and long term. What time scale does the Minister have in mind for the appointment of the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, which will come into being on 1 April next year? To what extent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
will it be involved, before it officially takes over, in some of the funding decisions with which colleges will have to grapple next year? Will he also accept that, as with the universities, there are additional administrative burdens relating to bursaries and fees and that much of the time of principals and heads of department has long been taken up in trying to meet budgets, which means that proportionately less time is taken up with education and teaching? Will the Minister tell us when he expects the parallel to the Kennedy report on further education in Scotland to be published?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the Minister notice about the rural and islands review that was announced earlier in the month. He is aware that there are concerns in the island areas about the inevitable additional costs and the fact that there is a natural ceiling on expansion, because of the small numbers of people who live there; to what extent will the island authorities be involved in that review? In a sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee in February 1996, I challenged the then Secretary of State, Michael Forsyth, to make a political commitment to the university of the Highlands and Islands. My delight was equalled only by his officials' surprise when he made that commitment. That exciting concept of a network of colleges that will deliver higher education to some of the remotest parts of the country was welcomed throughout the highlands and islands. Brian Duffield and I shared the platform at a conference in Yell, where we discussed the way in which the university of the Highlands and Islands has involved people in further and higher education. Today is a welcome opportunity for the Government not only to reaffirm their commitment to the university, but to explain what they are doing to help its progress and to ensure that it is no target to be designated as a higher education institution and to achieve its university charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have covered a wide range of subjects. No member of the Committee doubts the importance of further and higher education to Scotland as we approach the next century. The essential concern is one of funding; the Minister said in his response to Garrick that he believes in the compact. The staff of Scottish higher and further education institutions are desperate to meet the challenges, but they are like dogs straining on the leash of financial restraint. If the Minister can give us some positive assurances, the debate will have been worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speak too long at the beginning of the debate as I will have the opportunity to sum up at the end and I know that many hon. Members want to participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest and respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, who put his arguments very reasonably. However, his speech was something of a polo mint, with a large hole in the middle—there was no mention of the Liberal Democrats' commitment to additional spending on education. I do not think I heard him use the word "penny" once—far less three pennies. It would be interesting to know their current policy on that. I would expect all parties to put their views and I would like to know whether, in the Scottish Parliament, the Liberal Democrats would dismantle the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
arrangements for student funding. I also want to know from where they would raise the £140 million for use in higher and further education, which we can say will be raised through the measures. I am pleased to respond to the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman raised in that regard. No Government will hypothecate the sum of £140 million, but the basis of the changes in student funding is to get more money into higher and further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to my hon. Friend that another gap in the hon. and learned Gentleman's analysis was his failure to mention the Open university, which is important to many students in Orkney and Shetland? I hope that the Government will continue to support that university, which was one of the most remarkable achievements of the Wilson Administration. It owed a great deal to Jennie Lee and may the Government continue to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse entirely what my hon. Friend says. I hope that the university of the Highlands and Islands might be the Open university of this generation. Just as that university has the fantastic potential to open up the concept of distance and flexible learning, so the university of the Highlands and Islands is already the subject of international interest as a means of carrying learning through the same principles into remote communities. UHI is important not only for the highlands, but as a beacon to the world of how higher education can be made available to people—no matter how dispersed their communities are. I endorse all that my hon. Friend said about the Open university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sudden contention that no one encouraged the student support arrangements and that it was plucked out of thin air by the Labour Government is baloney. The hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) asked rhetorically whether the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland had ever met a principal who supported the introduction of tuition fees. I can confirm that the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals supported tuition fees in its submission to the Dearing report—and that included every principal in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred already to the Commission on Scottish Education. It was an independent body which met when Garrick and Dearing were being set up. It had no political axe to grind. It studied the problems of underfunding in education and decided that the way in which to get money into higher education was through the introduction of tuition fees. The commission concluded:
	<br><q><p>"Students should … contribute a fixed proportion of their course tuition fees, preferably under arrangements akin to those applying in Australia."</p></q>
The commission's membership comprised: its chairman, Charles Moncur; Dr. Malcolm Green from the education committee at Glasgow council; David Robertson, chairman of the court of the university of Dundee—which is now one of the universities that is complaining the hardest—and Sir David Smith, president of Wolfson college, Oxford and former principal of the university of Edinburgh. The hon. Member for Angus will be particularly happy to note that one of the signatories to the report was Margo
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
McDonald, journalist and broadcaster. Those wise and independent people put their heads together and decided that tuition fees were the right way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dearing committee did not recommend that 40 per cent. of Scottish students should not pay tuition fees; it said that everyone should pay £1,000 in such fees. The benevolent Labour Government came along and said, "No, that cannot be right. We must defend people from low-income backgrounds, because we want to widen access to higher education. In case there is confusion about whether people from low-income backgrounds will be able to afford to go to university, we say they will not be touched by tuition fees"—and that is what the Labour Government have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister appreciate that the remit given to the Dearing committee led it towards the idea of tuition fees? However, Dearing said also that student grants should remain, but this beneficent Labour Government have not done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because there are three elements in the package. To be fair, the Commission on Scottish Education took the same view. The package is a mixture that satisfies the three criteria. First, 40 per cent. of students—those whose family income is below the average—are not touched by tuition fees; they do not have to pay them. Secondly, those who are touched by tuition fees will have access to enhanced loans to ensure that they will be able to go into higher education. Thirdly, for the vast majority of students, the new loans system will be far more sympathetic and less onerous than the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman looks puzzled. I shall gladly send him a table to show the monthly repayments of tuition fees. He will see that nothing in this package will deter people from going to university on financial grounds—not vis-à-vis an ideal state in which nobody pays for anything, but vis-à-vis the present state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic idea seems to be that students and their families will pay tuition fees from current revenue and will also be left with massive loan debts at the end. The Minister should remember—Lord Hope confirms it—that his family could not have afforded to send him to university without a grants system. The new funding system will leave students with massive debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong again. I did not inquire at the time, but I am sure that my family could not afford to send me to university under the grant system, so the debt fell on them. The new system is better because the debt ultimately falls on the students—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman says "rubbish" [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I just assumed that it was the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I went to university, one student in 14 Scottish schools leavers never saw the inside of a university. Many of the other 13 in my community were every bit as capable of taking advantage of higher education if they had had the opportunity, but under that wonderful funding system-30 years on, the hon. Gentleman still sings its praises—they did not have a chance. That made a deep impression on me. Whatever else we say about the previous Government, they got an awful lot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
more people through university doors—an extraordinarily high proportion of people in Scotland, by the standards of the developed world. But they did not put up the money to maintain standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is entitled to inhabit his fairyland, but he will never have to implement any of his proposals. It is like having both pieces of cake. The participation rate in higher education is well over 40 per cent.—we hope to increase it—but there cannot be an education system that is completely free at the point of use. We cannot have it; no country has it. We want access to be maintained and we want to ensure that a sensible funding system is in place to sustain that level of access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outside the narrow political point scoring, anyone with any sense—including the university principals, the independent Commission on Scottish Education, and Dearing and Garrick—will know that that is the sort of mix that is needed. We can then pick the ingredients necessary to meet the political criterion of ensuring the widest possible access to higher education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Skye and Inverness, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a characteristically passionate, powerful and superficially persuasive case. Before becoming a Minister, the hon. Gentleman's output in broadcasting and journalism was voluminous. It seems rather odd that we never heard him advance that argument in one of his weekly columns in the 	<i>West Highland Free Press,</i> or anywhere else before the general election. If he was so passionately convinced, why was he not shouting it from the rooftops before 1 May instead of after?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to get into a contest about whose journalistic output was the greater. I argued against student loans at a time when more enlightened people, such as spokesmen for the National Union of Students, recommended their introduction. I did so for much the same reasons as we have heard today, on the assumption that their introduction would lead to a significant fall-off in the number of people from lower income backgrounds entering higher education. I was wrong, because the number of applications and admissions has continued to rise. The evidence suggests that what matters more to students is access to adequate finance when receiving education. The biggest barrier to access is a system that makes assumptions about funding which are not borne out in reality and does not provide students with the money to gain access to higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus mentioned student debt. A characteristically ludicrous article appeared this week in 	<i>The Scotsman,</i> which argued that Scottish students are uniquely burdened with debt and are worse off than students elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West has written to me about it. My journalistic experience taught me not to believe what appears in newspapers but to examine the source material. I therefore examined the source material, the NatWest study, and discovered that even after four years, Scottish students leave owing an average of £963 in bank overdrafts. That figure is not striking: most of us
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
left university owing at least £963. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Indeed, some of us still owe it. Far from being the highest figure in Britain, showing that Scottish students are uniquely persecuted by debt, the Scottish figure is one of the lowest in the United Kingdom. It is lower than that for the north-west, for Yorkshire, for the west midlands, for east anglia, for the south-east, and for the south-west and it is much lower than that for London. It is lower than the UK average. Scotland does triumph in one way: it boasts the highest proportion of students who attribute their debt not to the wickedness of Government but to an "expensive social life". I am glad to hear that some traditions are being maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister read out figures for debts to the Student Loans Company Ltd? The figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland, which do not differentiate between the two, show that 19 per cent. of their graduates owe over £4,000. In England, the figures for each region vary from 9 per cent. to 18 per cent. If debts to the bank and to the Student Loans Company Ltd. are added together, students from Scotland owe more. The Minister is being a wee bit sneaky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a serious allegation. Figures for student loans might be expected to be slighly higher in Scotland. The difference is slight; as the hon. Gentleman is aware, more students in Scotland take four-year degrees, so they have more time to accumulate debt. I am offering them the option to take three-year degrees, which would mean less debt. The hon. Gentleman does not want that either. He is very difficult to please.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was unaware that Mr. David Robertson, a member of the Commission on Scottish Education, died yesterday after an illness. I pay tribute to him as a former director of education in Tayside and to his work for that commission. Had I known about his death, I would obviously have referred to it earlier. I extend my sympathy to his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members live in a time warp about three-year and four-year degrees. It is a short-lived time warp: the "traditional" Scottish four-year degree is a very recent tradition. When I attended university, a small minority of students took four-year degrees. Within the past 25 or 30 years, the pendulum has swung in the direction of four-year degrees for many reasons, not all of which have much to do with educational advantage. Not everyone in Scotland wants to take a leisurely four-year degree or believes that that is the most appropriate way of using four years at that time of their lives. There are many people for whom a three-year degree is much more appropriate, and a better use of time, especially if they intend to go into industry afterwards. We are moving towards a far more flexible system that people enter and leave at times that are most appropriate to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that CSHEP complains about the introduction of advanced highers, and their being made equivalent to A-levels in some way. I remember speaking at a conference a few months ago that was organised by CSHEP, at which it launched a report on the equivalence between A-levels and advanced highers. The report, which was commissioned by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
Scottish Qualifications Authority, found that there would be equivalence between the two qualifications. That obviously opens the door for advanced highers to be the gateway to a three-year honours degree course in the same way as A-levels are. As I said, the conference was organised by CSHEP, and the report was welcomed by everyone who attended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised if the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland is telling me that advanced highers should have an inferior status to A-levels, in contradiction of CSHEP's report, which offers equivalence. That is a strange statement for him to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about what might happen if we were to go down that path, as Minister seems to be confirming that we shall. When I mentioned the word "tradition", I was referring not to the traditional four-year degree, but to the traditional breadth of the Scottish educational system, compared with the relative narrowness of the A-level system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister telling the Committee that he and his department are encouraging a narrowing of the Scottish educational system? If we encourage the advanced higher, which is equivalent to A-level, people might take only two or three, as opposed to the five or six highers that are taken at present. That is the issue. Does he see it a a threat to the broad base of the Scottish education system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. Is the hon. and learned Gentleman seriously suggesting that I should tell young people in Scotland to stay on for a sixth year at school to do advanced highers, but that they will gain no recognition for that when they go to university? There are some courses for which that qualification will be appropriate and others for which it will not, depending on the course and the advanced highers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must make progress. There is a danger of some nostalgic—and doubtless very learned—Opposition Members translating their own experience into the needs and aspirations of current and future generations of students. They feel that somehow the best of all possible worlds is to do six years at school followed by four years at university—by which time one is in middle age. That is not the best option for many students, and Scottish students should not be denied the opportunity to use that extra, very important year of their lives for whatever is best for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the past year, despite competing pressures, we have put an extra £17 million into the higher education sector in Scotland. I hope that we can build on that rapidly. The institutions seem to be complaining rather more loudly now than they did a year ago, on the basis of a settlement that is £17 million better than they had a year ago. So they would really be in trouble if there had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
not been a change of Government and the offer of that additional money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the further education sector, for which I have enormous respect. It does a magnificent and often undervalued job, taking students from a range of backgrounds that no university would contemplate. Further education centres deal with special needs, skills for the local community and everything else up to higher education. That is all mixed in as one product, within a further education system that historically has suffered from underfunding. That system deals with ever increasing numbers of students and with Government initiatives such as the new deal in an overwhelmingly professional and competent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that by way of a preamble. I also say quite openly that it is one of my priorities to get more money into further education, and I have tried to demonstrate that again. Some £11.4 million more is going into the FE system than was going in in the figures that we inherited. We paid in a first tranche of £7 million and then added £1.4 million of Budget money. On Friday I announced a £2 million fund to help restructure FE colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely puzzled, because four lecturers from Aberdeen college told me that its budget was being cut by £600,000 in cash terms this year—£1.7 million in real terms. They also told me that 60 teachers faced redundancy, class sizes were to rise, pupil contact was to be reduced and the agricultural college would have to sell its training farms. That does not sound like an expanding further education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may plead a special interest, my daughter is one of the 20,000 pupils at Aberdeen college, and she was beside herself when she came home because of the cut in teaching hours that she will face next year. She does not think that that will enable her to complete her course adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about Aberdeen college. What he said sounded like a pretty inflated description of the circumstances in which any college will find itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FE sector agreed to a review of the funding criteria and of the way in which money is divided up, and that has taken place. I can point the hon. Gentleman to colleges in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman) whose funding has gone up by 15 per cent. in the current year. Money has shifted according to the formula that was arrived at. A safety net has been built into the formula to ensure that no college is excessively disadvantaged. Some £11.4 million extra has gone into the FE sector since we took office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ensure that we are clear about our terms. Is the Minister talking about £11.4 million extra over and above what was planned? Does he accept that, notwithstanding the £2 million that was announced last week, the figure represents a standstill or, in fact, a reduction on what was spent and delivered last year? It is not surprising that my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon found that Aberdeen college had suffered a budget reduction in cash terms. That must apply to several colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may apply to several colleges. The figure that I mentioned represents a 1.5 per cent. increase in cash terms. Obviously, that still involves a small real-terms cut. Again, however, I should make a comparison with the inherited figures and mention that we have put an extra £11.4 million into the FE sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I place on record the appreciation of Lauder college for the extra funding that was made available to it as part of the additional funds that the Minister has just mentioned? The college felt that that was in recognition of the increase in its student numbers and of the work that it has done in targeting the long-term young unemployed and helping them to gain access to the opportunities that further education is so well placed to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That shows that there are two sides to the coin. Some other Members could, if they had the good grace, say that their local colleges had received increased funding—but I do not suppose that we shall hear that story. I should, however, mention that I went to Orkney and subsequently made a substantial additional sum available. [HON. MEMBERS: "Come to our constituencies."] I got very wet both inside and out. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Invitations are coming at me from everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already mentioned the university of the Highlands and Islands. That is both a visionary and a practical project, and it is already well under way. It involves close collaboration between the further and higher education sectors. It will increase opportunity for those whose job and domestic commitments preclude travelling, and bring access to higher education much closer to home. By attracting students into the area and expanding existing and new opportunities in business and industry, it also has the potential to make a major contribution to the local economies of the highlands and islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I visited the university of the Highlands and Islands project—UHI—last September, I said that I wanted nothing but the best for the highlands and islands. With that in mind, I established a review of the project. I asked officials to examine the progress to date and the plans for the future, with special emphasis on academic standards, the quality and richness of the student experience and the funding arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to announce that the outcome of the Scottish Office evaluation satisfies me that the best is exactly what the highlands and islands will get. The UHI project has demonstrated conclusively to me that the university is on course to become a first class institution. Academic quality and the richness of the educational experience lie at the heart of any successful university, and the study has convinced me that the project and its partner colleges are as committed as I am to securing the highest academic standards and the most fulfilling education experience for its students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am pleased to confirm that this year the Government will make a grant to the project of £12.5 million, the bulk of which will be spent on IT links between the partner institutions and on the continuation of academic development work. The UHI project team has responded to the review positively and welcomed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
the reasoning behind it. The review has been of considerable value to the UHI team as it carries forward academic preparations and the development of the case for recognition as a university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland would mention the university for industry—an exciting initiative that should be in operation by the year 2000. The university will be closely linked to wider UK developments but, because of our educational and other circumstances, it will be a distinctly Scottish entity. It will share a common central mission with what is going on south of border—a drive to promote learning at home and in the work place, to make information and guidance accessible to all, to identify gaps between supply and demand and to commission work to fill those gaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish university for industry—UFI—will be designed to be responsive to the needs of learners. It will provide support to employers and employees and meet their skill needs, and it will connect those who want to learn with the means to achieve it. People will be able to join directly or through their places of work. They will access learning through learning centres at work, at a college, school or library, at a shopping centre or at home—wherever it is most convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UFI will tell people what learning is available. It will explain particular qualifications and what they mean, and will advise people on their choice of learning. It will put people in touch with a learning provider, advise about any fees and about any available financial support, and explain how to get help locally. Essentially, it will offer easy access to a learning network for all and encourage people to learn throughout their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, the advisory group under Professor Alasdair MacFarlane, formerly of Herriot-Watt university, is making excellent progress in helping us to develop and promote the concept. More than £1 million is available this year to begin the work of implementation and to set up and run pilot projects. The development is important and exciting, and its influence will be critical to the lifelong learning agenda in Scotland. It will engage many new learners and ease access to learning for people right across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to speak about the widening of access to higher and further education, to which I have a strong commitment. On 1 May, I addressed a successful national conference in Glasgow on widening access. The conference's chief purpose was to explore access issues nationally and to encourage the strengthening of local partnerships, so that they can develop local solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the conference, I announced various actions that the Government are taking, specifically designed to improve access to higher education. I confirmed an earlier announcement that annual funding of £250,000 would be restored for three years for Newbattle abbey college, which provides courses targeted at groups under-represented in higher education—people who have been away from education for at least two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the college as the GCHQ of Scotland, in a sense, as its funding was removed as an act of ideological spite. That money should never have been taken away, and I am proud that we have been able to

restore it. I also want to extend my appreciation and good wishes to my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke), who is ill at present but who was as influential and courteous as ever as an advocate of Newbattle abbey college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the conference I also announced a package of up to £6 million, which the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland was good enough to welcome. It will extend tuition fee support to less well-off, part-time degree students in higher education, and support higher education institutions in developing courses aimed at that group. If the job of Government is to make a difference to people's lives, that is exactly the sort of thing that we should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package will allow an extra 3,000 people a year from low-income backgrounds to go into higher education on a part-time basis that they can handle. They will not be burdened by fees, which have often been a barrier to part-time courses. The package will transform people's lives, and give them access to higher education that they could not otherwise have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the pilot scheme will be built on and expanded. That answers the question about further education. Different arrangements in further education allow for the waiving of fees, for which the Scottish Office will compensate. No national provision for relief of fees has ever applied for part-time students in higher education. That is what has now been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the funding council has followed my guidance and provided for funds of about £1 million per year for at least five years to help institutions to promote wider participation. In line with the Dearing recommendation, the Government have doubled access funds and extended eligibility to part-time students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those measures have been taken to ensure not only that more students go into universities and colleges, but also that more of them come from the lower end of the social and economic scale. Even now only 11 per cent. of such people ever see the inside of a university, so that huge market is still to be tapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to extend my remarks or indulge in great perorations. The Government are doing a lot, and there is a lot more to be done. The debate is useful, and I assure the Committee that every constructive suggestion that is made, in line with the Government's policies and ambitions for higher and further education, will be listened to and taken seriously, from whatever source they emanate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the Minister's remarks about the hon. Member for Midlothian, whom I wish a speedy recovery. He is a valued colleague on the Scottish Affairs Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the announcement about the university of the Highlands and Islands. I understand that the Minister currently does not have his troubles to seek. I am sad to see problems in every sector in Scottish education, which is coping as best it can with the resources available. That underlines the many points made by the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of the Scottish National party, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Government's policy on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
further and higher education in Scotland. I am pleased to see that the Liberal Democrats and the Government now consider the subject important enough for Scottish Members to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill, no Scottish party apart from the Scottish National party contributed, and nor did any other Scottish Members apart from the parliamentary private secretary on duty take part in the debate. Not a single hon. Member representing a Scottish constituency was allowed to sit on the Committee considering the Bill. That is little short of scandalous, given the enormous impact of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish National party sought representation, but the Liberal Democrats chose to take up the two places, which were both occupied by English Members. The Government were entitled to more than half of the 22 places, but incredibly, they did not give any of them to Scottish Members. Why was the Minister not on the Committee? As a former president of the National Union of Students, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) must have gained relevant expertise, and he could have given the Committee the benefit of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish people emphatically endorsed the Scottish Parliament last September. They voted to take control of Scottish education back from Westminster. Yet such important Scottish legislation is still being shoehorned into basically English and Welsh Bills, and Scottish Members of Parliament are denied the opportunity to alter them in Committee. The sooner that the Scots Parliament is up and running and discussing those issues the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funding is the crucial issue in higher and further education. During the debate in the Scottish Grand Committee on 3 December 1997, the Secretary of State said that the central challenge was the need to get more resources into higher education if our students were to benefit from higher quality facilities and our national research base were not to be totally eroded. The Government have met that challenge by introducing tuition fees and abolishing grants, while making a cut of about 3 per cent. in real termS in higher education funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Students are being expected to pay more for lower quality, fewer lecturers and fewer resources. Universities and colleges are being asked to improve the quality of their courses while having to cope with more students and reduced funding. David Bleiman of the Association of University Teachers has said:
	<br><q><p>"Finding most of the resources by making the students pay … will neither provide the quality required nor prove socially acceptable nor facilitate the massive expansion and widening of access which the Government rightly seeks."</p></q>
The Minister has said that an additional £17 million has been allocated to higher education this year and that £11.4 million has been allocated to further education. However, it is perfectly clear that that fails to address the task in hand. Glasgow university, for example, has already shed 125 jobs. Napier university is encouraging staff over the age of 50 to take early retirement in order to save money. The Association of University Teachers estimates that 1,400 jobs will be lost in Scotland as a direct result of Government funding cuts. The Association of Scottish Colleges believes that further
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
education requires an extra £25 million in 1999–2000 to sustain current levels of activity and quality, to deliver Government initiatives such as "Higher Still" and the university for industry, and to deliver the extra places promised by the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish colleges have already made substantial efforts to improve efficiency and widen access, but they are severely restricted in how much more they can do on current budgets. The phasing of the budget for bursaries in cash terms means that opportunities for full-time further education are at a standstill. Those who receive the bursaries are now worse off in real terms than they were in previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider the findings of the Association of Scottish Colleges. Will he also assure me that the new Further Education Funding Council will be committed to openness and transparency, and that it will work closely with colleges to ensure stability of funding so that they can plan with confidence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Labour won the general election for several reasons. The main reason was the Conservative party, but another was the Labour party's promise to make education its priority. We all heard the phrase, "Education, education, education." One year ago it was new Labour, new hope. One year on, it is new Labour, same old Tory policies and same old Tory betrayals. Indeed, new Labour has gone beyond the Tories. Not only did the Labour Government adopt student loans, they privatised them, and then slammed on tuition fees. Students throughout the country have a right to feel betrayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here the text of an early-day motion that called on the Government to reverse its means-testing policy on student grants so as to allow students to live on a decent income. It notes that students have to survive on an income that is lower than that of those on income support and other benefits. It deplores student loans, which leave people in debt for many years, and calls for policies that provide for the well-being of all those studying in further and higher education. Surely we can all agree with those sentiments? That early-day motion was signed in 1995 by 10 current Government Ministers, five current Government Whips and 16 Scottish Members of Parliament, some of whom may be here today.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the Government must explain to their own Labour councillors why they continue to carry out the Tory policies of cuts.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard an extraordinary U-turn on the part of the Scottish National party. Its members hope to have tax-raising powers at their disposal and they have made a great issue of tuition fees, but they will not promise to use those powers to reverse what they obviously regard as an unacceptable policy. That sounds like total humbug. They are, to borrow a phrase, adopting the Labour party's spending plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The humbug is on the part of the Minister, given the difference between what he said in opposition and what he is saying in government. He should be patient—he will find properly costed policies that will defend Scottish education. The betrayal is his Government's; they have created a clearly devolved Scottish Assembly and cut further funds from it. They are forcing on the Scots Parliament—which is their creation—the same problems that they have forced on every Scottish local council. I assure the Minister that the SNP will always act in the interests of the Scottish people. We would make a more sensible Government than his party ever has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP supports the Government's stated aim of widening access to further and higher education within the context of lifelong learning. However, there is little substance behind new Labour's rhetoric. In fact, Labour's policies are likely to have the opposite effect to that intended. The Minister proudly told us that 40 per cent. of Scottish students will be exempt from tuition fees but he ignored the fact that 60 per cent. will, for the first time, have to pay towards the cost of tuition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He cannot pretend that means-testing fees will encourage those from poorer backgrounds when the Government's decision to abolish grants will force students into debt to the tune of £10,000 to £15,000. Loans may be income contingent, but they will act as a significant deterrent. Abolishing grants is the issue that students are most concerned about, as has been clearly shown in the student rallies, protest marches and petitions organised throughout the country. I note the great coalition across the Front Benches, but it cannot hide the fact that the Minister is totally out of step with opinion in education circles and especially among students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education must not be seen as a privilege of the rich; it should be accessible to all, regardless of wealth. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
is the view of students, parents, teachers, lecturers and principals, a view that the Government ignore at their peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's recent announcement that part-time students will receive means-tested help with the payment of tuition fees is a welcome step forward. I have questioned him about that for quite some time. However, the fact that those students are not allowed to take out student loans—let alone receive a grant—means that many will still be put off because they cannot afford the cost of maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim to be trying to encourage people of all ages into lifelong education, yet mature students over the age of 50 are not allowed to take out student loans. Only those who can afford it will be able to take a university course. Yet again, the poorest are being hit hardest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, under the new Labour Government, a student who is in receipt of a full grant and takes out a full loan receives almost £800 a year less than an unemployed single person claiming jobseeker's allowance and housing benefit. Under the proposed system, students will, if anything, be in a worse position. That is hardly an incentive for those on benefits to enter higher education. I should like the Minister to acknowledge that student hardship is a serious problem. The Government have not dealt with it properly. It is not a case of telling students to drink less and stop complaining. St Andrews' students association says that one in seven students has considered withdrawing from courses because of financial problems. The hardship funds are not sufficient to cope with increasing demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a written answer, the Minister said that £0.64 million has been allocated to a hardship loan fund, which will allow students to take out yet another loan up to a maximum of £250. That works out to less than one pot noodle a day. We are now seeing new Labour's pot noodle funding policy. The Government refuse to consider giving students housing benefit or any form of income support. As a result, students are having to take part-time jobs to support themselves, while coping with full-time studies. I emphasise that 96 per cent. of students said that they do that because they need the money and more than 80 per cent. of students said that it affected their attendance at lectures, their completion of casework and revision for exams. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] They will note the howl raised by the Labour party in response to their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their paper entitled, "The Learning Age", the Government said:
	<br><q><p>"this country has a great learning tradition. We have superb universities and colleges which help maintain our position as a world leader in technology, finance, design, manufacturing and in the creative industries. We want more people to have the chance to experience the richness of this tradition by participating in learning."</p></q>
This country will continue to be a world leader only if we expect our students to study, learn, invent and discover; but if we expect them to do that while serving pints or stacking supermarket shelves, we shall not maintain our lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By failing to provide the required resources, the new Labour Government are completely out of step with educational professionals and the general public. We will live or die in the 21st century by the intellectual
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
skills of our people. Scotland has all the ingredients for educational success if—and only if—there is a proper investment of resources. The Minister is now presiding over a resource crisis in every sector of the education system—because of deliberate, central Government financial policy. Scotland's further and higher education system deserves better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

Is he committing his party to unfreeze bursaries and, if so, at what level will they be restored?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to give the hon. Gentleman what his hon. Friends gave the Tories when they asked the same question of the Labour party before the general election. The Scottish National party will always put the people of Scotland first in its policy. I shall give the hon. Gentleman a parallel. Let us consider Labour councils that spend massively and provide poor services for their people. Let us also consider the good deal given by SNP-controlled councils in terms of finance and services. I envisage that as a model for what an SNP-controlled Government can give our people. We will make good, as far as we can within the limit of resources given, the mistakes of the present Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely interested in what the hon. Gentleman said. He used the phrase, "within the limit of resources given". Surely, the whole basis of the SNP's attack is that we have allegedly adopted someone else's spending plans. He is now talking about keeping within the limit of resources given. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his party in a Scottish Parliament will not use the opportunity to raise extra money? If so, that is all hot air and humbug. How will his party meet the £140 million for further and higher education, which our reforms will produce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot match the Minister for hot air and humbug. I pass the expertise on that to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have created a devolved Scottish Assembly, but, over the next year, they will reduce the £14 billion Scottish Office budget by about £1.6 billion. We shall then have less money to spend on those services. That should be contrasted with the enormous wealth that would be available to an independent Scotland. We could transform and revitalise our country but for the Minister's Barrow-minded, little-Britainer attitude. The devolved Scottish Assembly will have limited resources with which to combat those problems. I assure the Minister that the SNP, when in government, will use those resources in the best interests of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no excuse for this caretaker, temporary Minister making such promises. He will not be a member of that Assembly, which he calls a Parliament. Only a reversal of policy, and proper resourcing, will suffice to meet the present and future needs of Scotland's education system. That can be done only with independence. The sooner we gain independence, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is a travesty of the truth, and they should be ashamed of themselves for attempting to paint such a picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start at the top of the tree by considering Scotland's success in attracting research during the past few years. For example, St. Andrews university chemistry and psychology departments have raised themselves from the middle ranks of research to the very top. The same has happened with physics at Glasgow university and with micro-electronics at Edinburgh. The Stirling business school is much stronger. Paisley, one of our new universities, has developed new and exciting methods of distance learning, with people from overseas taking degree courses—an innovation of which we can be proud. There is so much in the Scottish education system of which we can be proud. It is a disgrace that the Opposition should be so mean-minded and petty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technology, too, has developed. Central Scotland has the best telecommunications system in Britain; British Telecom, its competitors in the cable industry and Scottish Telecom are putting down fibre networks. We shall be able to use those networks as an infrastructure to develop distance learning, which will be available in the highlands and in central Scotland. It will improve access to education for young people at university and colleges. People at home and at work will be able to take part in the university of industry, which we are now putting into practice. Scottish research units are attracting money from industry. Dundee has developed its biological and medical sciences over the past few years. There is so much to be proud of in the Scottish education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our further education colleges are developing new deals. Under the leadership of Marilyn Livingstone of the regional council—she is also head of the business school at Fife college of further education—Fife's employers, colleges of further education, the university and the local authority have set up a system to give every young person access to the education that we have promised them. Again, that is something of which we can be proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the position of the advanced higher. Two children of mine have recently left school and gone on to university. They both got their highers in the fifth year. They both made their applications for university and both received unconditional acceptances early in their sixth year—and they both stopped working when the acceptance arrived. It was the same for all their friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unconditional acceptance of children on the basis of their higher passes in the fifth year is a guarantee that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
the sixth year is a waste of time. The more quickly we change the system the better. I am entirely behind the higher-plus system as far as it goes, but I do not think that it goes far enough. The sixth year in Scottish schools should be used fully, enabling Scottish pupils to reduce the number of years that they spend on their courses at university. So many of our kids go ill prepared into the first year at university, and do the courses that they should have done in the sixth year at school. That is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mild problem of which my hon. Friend the Minister should be made aware. I respect the way in which he accepted responsibility for the fiasco with student grants last year, and I am sure that he has managed to fix it so that the same will not happen next year. However, I sound a note of caution. I am entirely in favour of moving over to a loans-based system for student support. I have supported that system for many years and I think that the Government are going about it in the right way. They have eased the burden on students, who will pay the money back only when they are earning enough. If they can pay it back over a long enough time, I do not believe that it is an excessive burden for any student to carry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Higher education is not a universal privilege. The majority of children in Scotland are guaranteed to be denied access to higher education, so I do not see why they should work to pay for others to go through it. That is unfair; people should accept responsibility for their own higher education. However, there is a problem in the further education sector of which I was made aware a couple of weeks ago by a liaison officer who works from the Fife college and deals with one of our poorer areas in east Fife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I was following the hon. Gentleman's argument correctly, he said that it was unfair for people who had not been through education to pay for the education of other people. How does that affect the people who cannot afford higher education in the first place? Will they not be provided with some support from the state for their education under a Labour Government, after five or 10 years? Is the Minister's commitment that 40 per cent. of the people who go on to higher education will be exempt just an unfortunate statistic that will be cast aside?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not put words into my mouth intentionally, so he must have misunderstood what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that as only a maximum of 40 per cent. will go through higher education at any one time, under a grants-based system the other 60 per cent. would pay for that privilege through their taxes. I think that that is wrong, and that those who go to university should pay for their own education through a loans system. I am saying that those who do not go on to higher education should not have to pay for other people to have a privilege that they themselves cannot receive. That would be unfair and inequitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a problem. The liaison officer who deals with an area of east Fife has informed me that the number of young people applying for courses this year has dropped dramatically. That is not because of the fees system—clearly, they would not be liable for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
fees—but because of their anxiety about taking out loans. My hon. Friend the Minister must recognise that we are trying to change the culture in Scotland about taking out loans, which we cannot do overnight. The problem will be repeated in similar areas around the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urgent action by my hon. friend's Department is needed. People must be educated about what a student loan means for them. They will have to be earning a considerable amount of money before they have to pay it back, and they will have many years in which to do it. At present, in ignorance, many people believe that they will have to start paying more, sooner and at a lower income level than will really be demanded. I have no doubt that that is dissuading people at the margins from going on to further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my hon. Friend's attention to another problem concerning teachers, in particular, but which also affects others in further education. It involves people who are on exchange contracts in other countries. A small number of Scottish teachers—I think about 25—and some from other sectors go to foreign countries on an exchange basis. Because of changes in the Budget this year, they will now be liable for income tax on earnings while they are abroad. That constitutes a problem for teachers who have gone to the United States of America. Their salaries, paid from this country, are much lower than comparable earnings in the United States. They have been able to go to the United States only because of the tax privilege that they have enjoyed until now. I have already flagged up that problem during consideration of the Finance Bill; the Scottish Office should be aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, the system that we have chosen is right. It is the only way to achieve a major expansion of education in Scotland. Our successes in higher and further education and in research allow us to hold our heads high. It is a sound basis for the future, and I wish my hon. Friend well in his future attempts to improve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Skye and Inverness, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the privilege of contributing to the debate, which I shall do briefly, bearing in mind the fact that other hon. Members also want to contribute. The Committee has turned into something of a confessional this afternoon. As far as I am aware, it is the first time in recorded history that the Minister, either in a ministerial or in a private capacity, has uttered the words, "I was wrong". In view of his other ministerial responsibilities, that should be translated into Gaelic, so that it reaches an even wider audience than the confines of this Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bha mi cearr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that 	<i>Hansard</i> will catch that in due course; that should be recorded for posterity, too. I share the Minister's view that we can all be wrong and change our minds. Moreover, if someone can be wrong once about one aspect of the argument, he can be wrong on another occasion. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland said when opening the debate, the Minister is wrong about student tuition
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
fees. I liken his defence to that for the private finance initiative, a development that he and I both know well and have seen in operation to spectacular effect in the construction of the Skye bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to argue that the moral defence for tuition fees was that they load the debt on to students, who will carry that debt into later life and try to wipe it out. The morality and logic of the PFI is the same: the debt is moved on to future generations, rather than taken out of contemporary direct taxation. He has written about the PFI extensively; he and I have shared platforms debating it. The problem is that because of the system that the Government have chosen, it is not only the debt that is transferred, but the long-term problem that the debt contributes to and exacerbates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After attending Glasgow university, I was fortunate enough to spend a year in the early 1980s on a Fulbright scholarship in the United States, where a comprehensive system of tuition fees and loans was in operation. Two things in southern Indiana struck me extremely strongly. First, as southern Indiana is comparatively poor in terms of per capita income, I was hard pressed to find any local students. The students came from more affluent areas in the north-east or on the west coast. Why? Because students from less affluent backgrounds did not receive the same degree of encouragement from their families to enter tertiary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the more middle-class students, who often did not need the loan, tended not to repay it. It was an extremely inefficient system. I was there during the Reagan Administration, when there was a major exposé of a staggering statistics—more than 80 per cent. of Reagan' s officials in the White House had not repaid their student debts. The people with whom the system tended to catch up were at the lower end of the scale—as is always the case, in any country. Those who tended to get away with it were the more affluent. It was therefore a thoroughly perverse system. How will the system operate in Scotland? I suspect that a similar problem will come to the fore in generations to come.

My second point is one that has not been touched on in the debate about tuition fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what happened in Indiana, but surely the problem to which the hon. Gentleman referred is dealt with by the fact that people from less well-off backgrounds will not be affected by tuition fees; they do not have to pay them. If we all help to communicate that message, people will not worry about the problem to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) referred, and which presumably existed in Indiana—the problem of people from lower-income backgrounds being liable to tuition fees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a combination of two things: tuition fees and the decisions taken by the previous Government on the student loans system. That is the double disincentive. The problem is created by the cumulative effect of the two. That is why one cannot consider the issue of tuition fees outside the context of the previous Government's policies, which if I remember rightly, the Labour party opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I have discussed tuition fees with the principal of Glasgow university—he disagrees with me on the issue, although his upbringing and academic background were in Australasia, so it is little wonder that he inclines towards the argument that the Minister prayed in aid. The problem, in terms of the on-campus, ancillary and related service sector employment generated by Glasgow university, Edinburgh university, Heriot-Watt university and so on, is significant. A high proportion of the jobs on north American campuses are being done by students, to pay their tuition fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal of Glasgow university would argue that that is a good thing and broadens students' education by encouraging a sense of responsibility and so on. It may do that, but let us not be under any illusions, many of those not particularly well-paid jobs in such cities as Glasgow and Edinburgh are none the less vital to those who do them. The policy will result in employment displacement, and that has not been adequately assessed in the Government's analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other two points are more local and specific. One is related to Inverness college, the other to the university of the Highlands and Islands. I was interested to receive a copy of a letter sent on behalf of the students by the president of the student association of Inverness college, Ivan Taylor, to my neighbouring Member of Parliament, the hon. Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart). He says in that letter, written a week or so ago:
	<br><q><p>"Although you claim that no-one will be deterred from entering higher education because funding is available, you are not taking account of students' reasonable unwillingness to incur high levels of debt, and preliminary figures suggest that applications are indeed down. This, especially if later compounded by students dropping out because their parents cannot or will not pay their fees, will lead to significant problems for institutions as their central funding depends on numbers."</p></q>
The Minister made the fair point that all politicians tend to look at education issues from the perspective of their own experience and that we are not necessarily up to speed. It is therefore worth while hearing from a student president of a college adjacent to my constituency about what the students are saying. What Mr. Taylor says in his letter is mild-mannered and measured, compared with what we have heard from many of the students whom we have encountered in various campuses across the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the student perspective at Inverness college; there is also the management perspective. My hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) talked about Aberdeen. The situation at Inverness is on a smaller scale but is none the less serious and significant. The management there are considering making up to 10 lecturing staff redundant, according to figures released in the past few days. I met the principal of the college last Monday to discuss the situation and he told me that up to £800,000 will have to be saved from the budget of £5.4 million, because this year the Scottish Office cut it by £43,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has happened partly because of the complexities of the formula to which the Minister referred, and partly because its impact, as he acknowleged, differs around the country. The Minister asked for constructive
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
suggestions, so I hope that he will take one from me. Principal Janet Price of Inverness college has argued as follows:
	<br><q><p>"In driving costs down to achieve greater efficiency we incur costs"—</p></q>
for example, severence payments and the on-going associated costs. That represents a substantial sum of money that must be supported from colleges' existing budgets. Janet Price believes that Inverness college, like others, is doubly disadvantaged. She argues for
	<br><q><p>"additional resources to underpin this temporary drive to make further efficiency savings"</p></q>
without access to contingency funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister last week announced that £2 million was available, but that money will be available on a competitive basis across the country. The figures that I have seen show that Inverness college would be well placed to gain access to part of that money—as would Aberdeen college, according to what I have heard this afternoon from my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Janet Price also argued that, compared with the total sectoral budge,
	<br><q><p>"the sums involved are comparatively tiny, but significant to us in a deficit position."</p></q>
The Minister has had various dealings with my area on a local basis over the past year. I recall that Inverness college's problems really hit the headlines in the middle of the general election campaign. However, difficulties persist: the college has increased its throughput, driven down management costs and done many of the things demanded by the Scottish Office, but it is still being hit. That is a serious problem, and I hope that the Minister will respond constructively, if not today then in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that Inverness college will be able to apply for some part of the £2 million restructuring fund. We bailed out Clydebank college last year in exactly the same way when it asked for restructuring help. The same principle can be applied to Inverness college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a big difference between using the money in that way and subsidising inefficiencies. The formula does not consist of figures plucked from thin air. It is closely related to colleges' performance in recent years. Some have achieved large growth but until now have not received accompanying funding, while others—of which Aberdeen college is one have achieved low levels of growth but have lived off the previous funding formula. No one in government or opposition should defend inefficiency, and we should not pretend that such problems do not exist in the sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister was not implying that I suggested that inefficiencies had not existed in the past. I do not think that he was, given that significant efficiency savings have been made in Inverness college. However, as local government discovered to its cost with the reorganisation introduced by the Conservative Government, the relevant legislation allows people to retain protected rights and income levels even though they are moved away or to a less senior administrative post. The associated financial penalty is the problem bedevilling Inverness college.

I warmly welcome the Minister's announcement of £2.5 million for the university of the Highlands and Islands. The evaluation exercise was welcomed as much by UHI as by the Scottish Office, and I hope that at the end of the debate the Minister will have time to flesh out the next phase of the timetable. When does he envisage that the project will achieve charter status and become a fully fledged, up-and-running university? There is continual interest in such issues in the highlands; indeed, there is a real buzz about it, and rightly so. Today was a welcome shot in the arm, but I hope that the Minister can go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rather ruefully said that university principals had made more noise about this year's financial settlement than they had about the one introduced under the regime that was in place until 1 May last year, which was £17 million less. There is a lesson in that, which was clear, too, during Prime Minister's Questions in the House this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon was not one of the Prime Minister's most comfortable, and he did not look happy as he stared at the expressions on his Back Benchers' faces. We are talking not only about the financial issue of inflation, although that is significant, but about political expectation. One should not be surprised by what happens when one raises people's hopes and aspirations—whether about hospital waiting lists or about what will happen to further and higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in response to the SNP that he was not sticking to Conservative spending limits, but the Prime Minister described those as "inherited" spending limits. That was an interesting word to use; it represents a complete abdication of political decision making. All of us in the political area raise expectations, particularly at election time; when one does so to the extent that the Labour party did a year ago, however, one should not start complaining or expressing surprise when people voice significant disappointment because their expectations have not been met. If that lesson more than any other comes out of the exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions and in Committee, it will have been well worth making the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Browne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the outset, I want to join my hon. Friends the Minister of State and the Member for Kirkcaldy, and the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland in paying tribute to those who teach our students in further and higher education. That they do so in the difficult circumstances of the unsustainable growth in education that we have inherited is all the more to their credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the speech by the hon. Member for Angus, but he made no reference to the difficulties with which the Government were presented when they took over responsibility for further and higher education. But then, he treated us to a speech that was long in recycled insults and allegations and short on solutions, so that is no surprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I speak about further education in Scotland, and particularly in Ayrshire, I want to mention the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy about advanced highers and the six years of school education. I have no statistical evidence, but I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
have extended family experience of young people who have recently been or become students at university. They have all gone at an immature age after a fifth year in school; they all had a broad Scottish education and had achieved the qualifications needed for university, and they felt compelled not to lose out on the opportunity of a job, because of the competition for jobs. I consistently advised them that it is important to go to university at a more mature age and to have the advantage of better preparation if one is to get the best from university. On concluding their university education, they all said that they felt that my advice was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy in encouraging students to stay on at school for a sixth year, although not for a wasted sixth year. I would be all in favour of an advanced highers system if it gave us an opportunity to prepare students properly and to reduce the time that they had to spend at university to achieve an appropriate qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak now about further education in Scotland, especially in Ayrshire. An understanding of the difficulties that the Government face requires at least a potted account of the legacy that the previous Government left. They left us with what I can describe only as a beggar your neighbour policy of unnecessary competition between colleges. That was wasteful and generated an unnecessary duplication of activity in many colleges. Moreover, colleges were not fully funded, but even in that environment they managed to increase the number of student activities. We have heard about increases of 25 per cent.: Kilmarnock college in my constituency showed an increase of 27 per cent., with a comparable increase in funding of only 8 per cent. over the same period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must note that colleges in Scotland were removed from local authority control almost overnight. That was done mainly for ideological reasons, but it left many colleges without local authority support and infrastructure. They had to replace that with independent management. My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire) also pointed out earlier today that many colleges also depended on European Union funding, but were left without the in-house expertise necessary to apply for and administer that funding. Some found themselves in straitened financial circumstances almost as soon as they took over sole responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In further education, as with higher education, the Government have inherited a financial mess. The National Audit Office report "Corporate Governance and Financial Management in Colleges", which was published on 30 April 1998, shows that 39 out of 43 colleges forecast a financial deficit for the year 1997–98. We must bear in mind the fact that many of these colleges operated in buildings that were built in the 1960s. As many of us know, most of those buildings are unsuitable for any long-term use. There was a consistent lack of capital investment provision by the previous Government. In their last year, they contributed very little to capital funding for maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite those difficulties, the current Government recognise the scale and importance of further education to their strategies and policies. We heard from my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Friend the Minister how that recognition has been translated into substantial additional money for the sector. There was the recent additional £1.4 million, to which reference has already been made. That is on top of the £2 million—announced only weeks ago—to help colleges continue their restructuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland asked what role the Government saw for further education in the new deal. He also mentioned lifelong learning. My constituency provides a good example of the part that further education colleges can play in the delivery of the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Ayr and Kilmarnock colleges are involved in an innovative scheme known as the East Ayrshire employment initiative. In anticipation of the new deal coming on-stream, a partnership was developed—led substantially by the local authority—which involved both colleges, local private enterprise and Ayrshire Enterprise, which is the enterprise company. The Employment Service locally also contributed. That partnership developed into the East Ayrshire employment initiative. I have great hopes for it, as well as for the people of east Ayrshire, particularly those who are unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative has developed expertise to such an extent that it was able successfully to bid for a significant contract to deliver the new deal across the board in east Ayrshire. That is a very good example of how partnership can work and how colleges can be involved in delivering the new deal. The further education colleges will play an important role in lifelong learning—the Minister has confirmed that that is central to the Government's thinking. They will also play an important role in collaborative partnerships with local authorities in delivering, with schools, "Higher Still". The strategic framework that is due to be announced in the near future also forms part of the Government's strategy. The Further Education Funding Council represents a significant recognition by the Government of the strategic importance of further education. It will put funding at arm's length from the Government and will ensure that the strategic framework is implemented without the potential for political interference in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Colleges have an important role to play in contributing to the Government's social exclusion agenda and dealing with, for example, the provision of access courses and the training of skilled support workers for the national child care strategy, which integrates with the provisions of the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education also plays an important role in post-school provision for students with learning difficulties. My hon. Friend the Minister is to be congratulated for setting up the Beattie commission, which will be important in obtaining national recognition for the work that is done by further education colleges and in generating future strategies for supporting students with learning difficulties. Kilmarnock college, which is in my constituency, has taken on 80 full-time students and more than 300 part-time students with learning difficulties. That is a major contribution towards the education of people who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
would otherwise be ignored by the available educational facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the specific issue of further education provision in Ayrshire. There are two colleges in Ayrshire—Ayr college and Kilmarnock college. They operate, as their names suggest, from centres within the towns of Kilmarnock and Ayr, but they also have satellite provision in other parts of the county. It has been recognised for some time that north Ayrshire is ill-provided for in terms of further education opportunities. North Ayrshire council, Enterprise Ayrshire and the three towns initiative have tried to fill that gap, having rightly taken the view that the absence of local provision has depressed the uptake of further education in the area. Consequently, the skills problem has not been properly addressed in an area of high unemployment. Those bodies also believed the absence of a significant further education facility to be a disincentive to inward investment and to the raising of training levels within existing employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coopers and Lybrand produced a report in 1996, and proposals were subsequently submitted by three colleges—James Watt college, Kilmarnock college and Ayr college—for the expansion of Ayrshire's further education provision. Professor McCool was appointed to the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department to review the provision in terms of the Secretary of State's statutory duty to secure adequate and efficient provision of further education in the area. His report was published in November 1997. At that time my hon. friend the Minister met the chairman and principals of the three colleges and confirmed to them that he wished to proceed with the recommendations of the McCool report. The report recommended that James Watt college's proposal to establish a large new campus at Kilwinning should be put into action. That would provide for up to 5,000 students in phase one and phase two, for a further 2,500 students at a later date, and also for some smaller community learning in the three towns area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he indicated his wish to proceed with the report's recommendations, the Minister said that the plan was to be broadly based on the proposal by James Watt college to develop a mainstream further education college at Kilwinning
	<br><q><p>"but subject to discussion over the scale and curriculum with a view to securing complementarity of provision rather than competition between providers".</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Minister also recommended that the discussion be initiated to address the immediate and long-term provision in three towns in that part of north Ayrshire involving Auchenharvie academy in Stevenson. He emphasised people's prime consideration by referring to their letters. He stated:
	<br><q><p>"the displacement effects of the new College on existing providers needed to be carefully assessed and minimised so that provision in neighbouring areas would not be adversely affected."</p></q>
I take it from that that the decision has been made, more than just in principle, to proceed with the proposal made by James Watt college, as recommended by Professor McCool, although with important subjective qualifications as to how it would be achieved. To fulfil thoe qualifications, a working group was set up, involving representatives of the two existing colleges and of the Scottish Office Education and Industry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Department, a representative of James Watt college, and others, including the enterprise company, which discussed the curriculum with a view to achieving the Minister's objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My information is that those discussions have occurred, but that the curriculum proposals made by James Watt college appear to be accepted by North Ayrshire council. They would cause significant displacement and detrimental effects, especially in my college in Kilmarnock. I am told that the worst possible scenario would involve a loss of full-time students that would result in a loss of 23 or 24 full-time teaching posts and of 14 support staff. I hasten to say that those are estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, Ayr college and Kilmarnock college have come together to consider the implications of the proposal as it proceeds. It has provided one significant beneficial development: it has generated collaboration and co-operation that previously did not exist between the two colleges. I am sure that the Minister will welcome that. 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 8 May 1998 stated that he would welcome and encourage the rationalisation and closer collaboration between colleges and pointed out that
	<br><q><p>"Ayrshire in particular is ripe for reationalisation."</p></q>
I can report to the Minister that Ayr and Kilmarnock colleges have now agreed matters for immediate collaboration to expand further education opportunities in Ayrshire. As a result of the discussions, they have agreed to work together on the promotion of a centre of engineering excellence in Ayrshire. I know that that is close to the Minister's heart. They have also agreed to collaborate substantially and to work together in merging unnecessary administration. It is reported to me that all this is done with a view to an early merger into a single college. I am sure that the Minister would welcome such a development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are new circumstances that offer a fresh vision of further education in Ayrshire. The prospect of an Ayrshire college, operating on a distributive basis with main centres delivering a core provision in each of the three Ayrshire council areas, with additional output in smaller satellites across the county, is exciting. Such a network would provide a rational approach to extending significantly the further education opportunities available to the people of Ayrshire, which is an area vital to Scotland's economic development. Such a development would generate complementarity of provision and improve local access. The Minister has set those objectives. The proposal is the epitome of efficiency, effectiveness and economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An all-Ayrshire further education college could address fully the aspirations of each of the Ayrshire local authorities, and in my view it would be a fitting achievement for the new millennium. I suspect, however, that that vision is currently unachievable and that the die is cast for Kilwinning college—as proposed by James Watt college and as recommended by Professor McCool. I have had the benefit of reading the Minister's correspondence with Kilmarnock college and others. Given the different circumstances from those in which Professor McCool reported, I urge my hon. Friend to consider the possibility of a feasibility study.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. It has been suggested that members of the Committee should bear in mind their experiences in colleges and universities when participating in the debate. Looking around the Room, I can see that I may be in a unique position in that I can count students as friends, not just as family members. [HON. MEMBERS: "That shows your age."] Or the lack of it. I am sure that my scope of student friends has been expanded as a consequence of the Minister's policy. Your son, Mr. Maxton, is a friend and he is a keen advocate of the Government's policies. I studied at Cardonald college of further education as a part-time student while unemployed. I was fortunate to carry out studies as a mature student, undertaking my highers again, and to claim social security benefit, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then attended Strathclyde university, where I took out a student loan, which I am still repaying. I become president of the National Union of Students. I then attended the Open university—I am also still repaying that fee—after which I attended Strathclyde university as a part-time student and paid a fee which I am again still repaying. As a consequence of the Minister's recent announcement, I might have been exempt from one of those fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of students who will benefit from the Government's policy are those I met at Cardonald college of further education about nine or 10 years ago. They were almost exclusively mature students with few formal qualifications. In the main, they were from proper backgrounds and were people who, at that time, had no real expectation with regard to study at a further education college and very little expectation of studying for a degree at a university. That was how the system was structured, and the Government at the time were not sensitive to the needs of students or their experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I welcome so strongly the 40 per cent. exemption rule. It was not recommended by Dearing or Garrick. Indeed, if it were not for the Government's sensitive and flexible implementation of the Dearing and Garrick proposals, those students would have had to pay fees in the same way that any students would do, regardless of their financial background. I am a keen supporter of the 40 per cent. threshold because those whom I studied with, many of whom I have kept in contact with, will benefit from it. The new system will enhance opportunities. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has talked about doing that for 500,000 more students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is not an ally in respect of my comments this evening, but I wish to say how much I welcome the new mood of co-operation that is sweeping through further education. Competition was endemic and was encouraged by the previous Government; colleges within a mile or two of each other were reading one another's curriculums and prospectuses, not with a view to co-operation but to see how they could compete and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
whether there was a niche in the market. It was distinctly unhelpful and a waste of college resources. The enticement of competition led many students into making poor choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those comments, curtailed as they are, I welcome the Government's announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try not to repeat what was said so well by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland and by my hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy). I shall first reply to some of the points raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were accused of not being positive enough. Both of my colleagues emphasised strongly that we feel that further and higher education has done an amazing job of educating so many more people with reduced resources. That is a positive story, but a crisis is approaching because the funds are not adequate for the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were asked about our position on income tax. It is still the same. Our latest proposal, put forward at the time of the Budget, is once again that we should put 1p on income tax. We feel that education would be the highest priority for a Scottish Parliament. Depending on the political circumstances, and whether the money was coming from the British Treasury or the Scottish Treasury, we would raise the necessary funds for education through taxation. We have not retreated from our commitment to provide the money necessary for education at school, college and university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that more students are going on to further and higher education, but the main problem is that neither the previous Government nor the present Government have adequately funded students. The Minister mentioned the principal of the university of Strathclyde, Sir John Arbuthnott. I shall briefly quote his letter, which stated:
	<br><q><p>"Therefore the student contributions to fees arc not bringing any additional funding into Scottish Higher Education. This was not what was envisaged by Dearing and Garrick, who concluded that the way forward to fund the HE system that all the United Kingdom needed was through a compact of the stakeholders. The Government's share in this compact was to ensure sufficient core funding (by making not more than a I per cent. cut in current HE funding) to enable HE institutions to do their job and to plough any additional funding raised from students contributing to the costs of their higher education back into the HE system. In Scotland neither of these has happened."</p></q>
The Minister should not pray in aid Dearing, Garrick and others; their proposition was that the fee money should go into helpingt education expenditure. The Minister's reply that the Treasury never allows hypothecation of taxes misses the point. It is not a tax: it is a fee. It is quite reasonable for fees to be hypothecated to help the institution to which the fees are paid. It is a matter of common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear why the hon. Gentleman should want to quote Sir John Arbuthnott. Tuition fees have not yet been introduced, so how can he say that the money from tuition fees has not been ploughed back? The money does not yet exist, but on the basis of the initial projections, there will be an extra
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
£18 million. I wonder how the hon. Gentleman expects that to happen before tuition fees are introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Government budget ahead—not very well, but they try. That budget does not include money from fees going into higher and further education. The Minister said that the money will not be hypothecated, so it will not go to the colleges to which the students have paid fees. The concern expressed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland about "Higher Still"—the advanced higher—and suggested structure of degrees was not that we were against them, but that changes must retain the breadth of Scottish education. That is fundamental to our system, which although common throughout Europe, is uncharacteristic in England. Just at a time when the English are noticing that everyone else is more broadly educated, it is foolish for the Scots to go in the English direction. Will the Minister ensure that any changes retain the breadth of education both at school and university?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister queried the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) about Aberdeen university, but the figures are in the letter—a cut of £830,000 means that it must find £1.5 million in efficiency savings this year. More and more comments from universities and colleges have been received on the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked whether we would abolish student fees in a Scottish Parliament. The issue would be part of our shopping list when considering what we could afford. We would relate it to all the other pressures on our expenditure and, if possible, abolish them, but we cannot commit ourselves to doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wrote to all the principals of the colleges and universities in Scotland and have had about 45 replies so far. They all emphasised that finance was a critical issue and that they had serious difficulty in meeting their bills and paying for the changes that they have made. They have greatly increased productivity but are not being rewarded for it. The reward for the people who work in colleges and universities has been exceptionally low pay increases. If they were in the private sector, they would get bonuses galore, golden handshakes and so on. Although they have done an amazing job in increasing productivity—probably more than any private sector firm has done—being in the private sector, they are treated very badly financially by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should take account of the criticisms that have been made. The principals say that because the funding system is retrospective, they cannot plan ahead. The formula is variable, so they cannot count on having the same unit per student as they did in the past. No one can plan ahead when funding is retrospective and the formula is variable. Colleges and universities have to face the cost of collecting fees—they already have the cost of distributing bursaries and will face the problem of unpaid fees. It is alleged that there is some allowance made for that, but from our experience of the poll tax, I suspect that it is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Colleges complain about excessive bureaucracy at the centre and about the duplication of monitoring and auditing. Obviously, such activities need to be done, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
there could be one coherent team doing it, whereas, at present, colleges and universities are trampled all over by successive waves of monitors, bureaucrats and so on. They feel that the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council is forcing policies on them. The funding arrangements are too centralised and officials are too remote from the scene of the action so they make bad decisions. In particular, they force through mergers by financial inducement to colleges. Out of the strategic change grant of £6.5 million, £4.2 million is being used to assist mergers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The colleges feel that the fixed element of their grant, which is being reduced, penalises the small colleges. Indeed, the small rural and island colleges believe very strongly that they are being seriously disadvantaged. They feel that they can help in training, but in some areas, local enterprise companies do not co-operate with them, and their facilities are not used. Inferior private facilities are used. Colleges could do a great deal to help proposed training schemes such as new start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Colleges also feel that they could assist in ending social exclusion, that a college can often be the first rung on the ladder, and that they have no opportunity to contribute to that. They feel that more priority should be given to higher national certificates and diplomas, which contribute greatly to our economy, and that there should not be a cap on the number of advanced students. They have no capital and poor buildings. They are apprehensive that the Scottish Further Education Funding Council is not active, and think that its personnel should be training and acquiring knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland said at the beginning of the debate, further and higher education constitutes both an opportunity and a great risk. Many colleges and universities live on a knife edge, financially. If the Minister can help them, they can make a huge contribution to the education and improvement of our country. If he does not help them and improve the system, much trouble will ensue and many more people will lose their jobs. It will mean a great loss of opportunity for our young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy for putting the debate into context. In all such greetin' meetings, the subject under consideration often seems to be a disaster, falling around our ears, which is just not true. We have some of the best universities in the world. Our universities' research departments contribute to our ability to attract the cutting edge of technological innovation in industry. We have one of the highest participation rates in the world. In California recently, I read an article in the 	<i>San Francisco Examiner,</i> which marvelled at the high level of participation in higher education in Scotland. I wish that we could read that in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I wish that we could read anything in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> Public expenditure on teaching per full-time student in higher
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
education per year is 10 per cent. higher in Scotland than in England. We have a vibrant further education sector whose work everyone admires, whatever its difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members made complaints about island colleges; the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland knows what we have done for Orkney college. Although such facts are not often referred to in debates such as this, we have put an extra £4.6 million into Lews Castle college, to enable it to participate fully in the university of the Highlands and Islands. Although I am not being defensive about that, it would be nice to receive more recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy), who has left, mentioned Cardonald college, one of his various almae maters. Had he time, he could have talked about the other side of college funding. On the basis of revised formulae, it receives 4 per cent. extra a year, which equates to £260,000, and will do rather well. I do not think that its management will have written to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West to complain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An immense amount of good work is being undertaken. We all agree that it is desirable to put more money into further and higher education. We have a decent record on that. The debate has been notable, and useful, in the longer term, for flushing out spending intentions. We have proposals and we have legislation. We know exactly where the money is coming from for higher and further education in Scotland, and and we can put that to the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished to hear the SNP retreat from making a commitment. They have been professional mourners on the subject for months. They said that it was the worst thing that has ever happened to higher and further education in Scotland, and that is a complete betrayal of everything that is good in the Scottish education systems, yet they are not going to do anything about it. That is astonishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will understand, because the Labour party went through the process before the election, that we carefully costed all proposals. We did it before the 1997 election, as did the Labour party. Before the 1999 elections, the SNP will come forward with well-costed proposals, identifying what we will do and what we can afford. However, we must accept that the Scottish Parliament will be working under tight financial constraints under a funding settlement imposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer—although we shall have the option to utilise tax-varying powers.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the SNP's rhetoric in recent months, no one in Scotland will believe that their first action on entering a Scottish Parliament will be to abolish tuition fees and restore student grants. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman speaks for Nicola Sturgeon, who appears in the mandatory last paragraph in every story about education, saying, "We should be spending 10 times more money." In so far as the hon. Gentleman speaks for the SNP, we are told they have no such plans. As I said earlier, everything that is said is hot air, because the SNP is making no commitment to reverse what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree strongly with my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy that we ought to do more. I wish that I knew better how to communicate the correct information to young people; they are making their life choices, but have been misled by headlines and political mischief into believing that every student would have to pay
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
£1,000 and that further or higher education is therefore beyond their reach. I assure the Committee that we are doing everything possible to counter that, but I am open to suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respond next to the hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West. As we said in the summary of our proposals, we hope to counter that. The Government are considering whether repayments might be collected through the Inland Revenue. I understand that 80 per cent. of Reagan's cabinet might have been outside the American revenue system. However, that may be not only much more efficient, but much less painfull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun for referring to the Beattie committee. I hope that all hon. Members will go back to their constituencies and tell them how important that inquiry is. It is investigating that twilight area of provision—post-school provision for special educational needs and learning difficulties. Anyone who can contribute to work of that committee is welcome to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak briefly about Ayrshire. If Kilmarnock and Ayr had done this two or three years ago, we might be in a different situation. We have been through all that, and there is no intention of revisiting the proposals for North Ayrshire college, or the university of Kilwinning, as it may one day become.

I hope that the Minister can change his hat and now speak about his responsibilities for industry. I am obliged to him for consenting to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) to contribute to this short but very important debate—as long as he catches your eye, Mr. Maxton, but that should not be hard as he is quite tall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous debate on the problems of higher and further education in Scotland was a very good one. All hon. Members agree that education and training must provide the opportunities needed by children to succeed. Nevertheless, real problems exist in the Borders and I want to rehearse some of them this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 12 months, 700 jobs have been lost in the Borders, and those losses are starting to show up in the official unemployment statistics in a very worrying way. New figures produced by the House of Commons Library show that my constituency of Roxburgh and Berwickshire experienced an increase of 11.6 per cent. in unemployed claimants over the 12 months from April 1997 to April 1998. That rate of change is unprecedented since my election to the House in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compared with what has happened in other constituencies across the United Kingdom, the annual rate of increase in unemployment in Roxburgh and Berwickshire was the worst of all: it ranked 659th out of 659 constituencies. That trend has accelerated over the past two years, and is expected to get worse. The most recent confirmed redundancies—at Pringle of Scotland in Hawick and at Via Systems in Selkirk—will eventually be included in the official statistics. Yet the statistics only reinforce what local people have known for some time. Unemployment in the travel-to-work areas in the Borders remains below the Scottish average of about 6 per cent., but whereas unemployment in every other part of the country is falling, in my constituency it is getting significantly worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I was elected in 1983, all the main employer industries in the Borders at different times have experienced short-term, temporary, cyclical recessions. For the first time in my experience, the principal sectors creating local jobs—fishing, farming, forestry, electronics and textiles—are experiencing cyclical and/or structural recession at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have to suspend the Committee for 10 minutes, which should allow us ample time to return.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<p>7.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance about the procedure to be adopted on the interruption of our proceedings for a Division in the Chamber, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Division, I said that, for the first time in my experience, all the employing sectors in the Borders were undergoing downturns at the same time. Although much emphasis has recently been put locally on industrial and manufacturing job losses, the farming sector has suffered many job losses and much job erosion in the past 12 months. This week, we expect a survey of farm incomes to be published. It has been sponsored by the local National Farmers Union, the local authority and the local enterprise company. It will show dramatic decreases in farm incomes across the region as a result of BSE. It will also show decreases in incomes in the cereal sector because of changes in agricultural subsidies and farm prices. Sizeable numbers of jobs are, therefore, being lost not only in manufacturing enterprises; there is a salami slicing of employment prospects in the fanning sector, which we must not ignore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I detect a high level of frustration locally. We have argued for years that the trends were heading in the direction that I described. The Scottish Office Education and Industry Department was told and previous Ministers who went down to the Borders were told in no uncertain terms what would continue to happen unless action was taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a creeping feeling that central Government are insensitive to the needs of more rural areas. Those needs might be different from those of inner cities, city estates and peripheral estates, but they are none the less as great. There is a real feeling in south-east Scotland that we need help now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be careful about predicting doom and gloom because that can make the situation worse, and I do not want to get involved in that. I want, however, to make it clear to the Minister that we must fight to prevent every redundancy that we can. I am sure that he will join me in saying so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a few short weeks, if not a few short months to tackle the problem and to see what can be done. To do that, we need a strategy, as do some of the industries involved—that is certainly true of the knitwear sector. The Government also need a strategy. The target should be to get assistance to stabilise the existing manufacturing sectors and to promote new job opportunities in diversified industries for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one or two suggestions about what could be done. I have tried to be realistic, because although I know that Ministers have immense power, I do not think they have magic wands. I understand that there are constraints on what even a Minister in the Scottish Office with responsibility for industry can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose that the Minister sets up an ad hoc cross-departmental high-level group of Scottish Office officials to work together with local authorities and local enterprise companies, which have been active in the field, to try to find ways of, for example, financing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
and building new factory premises for any existing knitwear manufacturers that might otherwise have to wind up their businesses or transfer their operations south of the border or, worse, outside the United Kingdom altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That small working group could meet some of the bigger companies that are facing difficulties and try to talk through their problems and meet their concerns. It could bring to bear the full panoply of the Government's forces in trying to improve their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any such working party could begin urgently to prepare a case of the inclusion of the Borders, either by itself or in conjunction with other areas such as southwest Scotland, in the next UK regional assistance programme or, if not that, the next round of European structural funding, which will come on stream after 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, such a group could find ways of bringing forward existing essential local projects—such as the Hawick community hospital replacement—which are more or less already approved but waiting for financial authority. Getting them started straight away would improve employment prospects for the local community. There have been genuine difficulties with that, although not at the hands of central Government. With a wee bit of assistance, however, central Government could help expedite such projects, which would give a psychological as well as an employment boost to communities in towns such as Hawick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need help in securing further investment in essential roads and other infrastructure to and from the region. The expedition of projects such as the Hawick traffic management scheme would be helpful. We need to consider ways of increasing additional borrowing consent for the local authority over the coming 12-month period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we could also consider ways of obtaining more assistance from the welfare-to-work programme. The last time I inquired, I was surprised and disappointed to find that we have so far managed to persuade only 14 young people—helped by some 16 advisers—into the gateway across the entire region. The situation may have since changed. I am in favour of the welfare-to-work programme—the Government have done the right thing—but there are problems in rolling out such schemes sensibly in rural areas with transport problems and the rest. The Government could do more to help in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many redundant mill properties in the area. Lottery funding could be one of a number of ways of turning some of those properties into modern business start-up centres. We are still the only region in Scotland that does not have a community business enterprise operating in its area, although we have a tradition of self-employment and small firms. We might turn our minds to that, with central Government assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The university for industry, which was mentioned previously, could be of potential assistance to the Borders. I understand that pilot projects are being considered around Napier university. I know that there are processes to be gone through, but if, as part of their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
proposals, the Government looked favourably on any project that had a positive impact and outcome for south-east Scotland, that would also be of considerable assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an enormous amount of potential and a skilled and willing local work force in the area. As far as I can tell, we have not undertaken a skill survey of that work force, which we should perhaps consider. As the Minister will know, earnings are well below the average for Scotland and they are also lower than in neigbouring areas. That is an incentive for people who have been made redundant to leave the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority and the local enterprise company are doing everything they can from small and diminishing budgets. If ways could be found to provide access to new funds that could be drawn on to finance development, stabilise existing firms and promote diversification in the region over the next two or three years, it would be possible to turn round the local economy and provide it with a sustainable future. If the Minister cannot provide access to new resources, I think that he is in danger of presiding over a new wave of depopulation in the Borders. The working age population is at a worrying level, and we could return to all the worst problems of the early 1960s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We look forward to the Minister's return visit in July, and we hope and pray that he will be able to provide some tangible financial assistance for the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

These are difficult times in the Borders. I endorse the bleak but accurate picture of what is happening there painted by my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, and I hope that the Minister will respond favourably to his imaginative ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus on the key issues affecting the electronics sector in the Borders, with special regard to Via Systems, whose operations in Selkirk and Galashiels last week announced 210 job losses. Today we learn that another printed circuit board manufacturer in my constituency, Signum Circuits, is moving to a four-day week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I and my hon. Friend will be able to meet senior US managers at the corporate level of Via Systems as soon as possible, so that we can learn their intentions for the future. However, it is clear, as the group's activities become better understood by the public, that the crucial factor is the operation of public assistance elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Given that UK concordates and all sorts of other arrangements exist between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Scottish Office, the last thing that Government policy is designed to do is to promote job creation in one part of the country at the expense of jobs in other parts. Yet there is real worry in the Borders that Via Systems' new north Tyneside facility—the recipient of considerable public assistance recently—will suck business away from the plants in Selkirk and Galashiels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister received the letter that I sent him yesterday, and that he will be able to answer some of the points that I raised in it. I would appreciate an idea of the nature and amount of public assistance given to Via Systems plants across the UK. Do the amounts given for job creation at particular plants take account of job losses announced elsewhere in the group's operations? What plans does he have to meet Via Systems' managers? What monitoring of that company's progress is he able to accomplish?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in the borders is grim. Morale is very low: I agree that we must not talk matters down, but the worry is that the iniquities of the system of Government assistance mean that not only is public money being denied to the area but that it is also being used to deny jobs there. I hope the Minister can respond favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) on securing the debate, and I appreciate the reasonable way in which he nad his colleague, the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), expressed their arguments. My initial reaction is that all the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire must be taken seriously and investigated further. I am aware of the need to do more to help the Borders in what is obviously a difficult time, and I hope that we shall make modest progress to that end this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been kept in close touch with the problems by my officials, who have had several meetings with Scottish Borders Enterprise and Scottish Borders council. Indeed, there was a meeting this morning, and I look forward to receiving a report on the range of possible actions to help job creation discussed at that meeting. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire knows, I have arranged to revisit the Borders at the beginning of July, to follow up the visit that I made last September. As I said yesterday, I regret that circumstances prevented an earlier return visit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem in the Borders, as we agreed was evident on my previous visit, is that bald statistics do not suggest that the area as a whole has an especially bad or chronic problem of unemployment. The latest level is 4.1 per cent., which is one of the lowest in Scotland. However, I am aware of arguments about the influence of out-migration on that figure. The area is not doing well with regard to other measures. Its gross domestic product per head ranks eighth out of nine former regions, and average earnings are 88 per cent. of the UK average. The proportion of people aged over 65 is more than average. Many people are forced into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
leaving the area altogether to get jobs, or into commuting long distances. That helps to disguise the seriousness of the endemic problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also pockets of severe or imminently severe problems, such as Hawick, which has an especially strong dependency on textiles. I cannot see the competition from textile manufacturing in low-labour-cost countries easing off. The Borders textile industry can survive only by becoming more competitive and by finding quality products that do not compete head on with those produced at low cost elsewhere in the world. No amount of public funds poured into the industry can alter the extent of the competition, and to attempt to stem it on the basis that I outlined is the wrong approach. We should look for the right approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking more positively, while there have been relatively few large job announcements in the Borders in recent years, some notable successes have occurred. Well-established companies such as Mainetti, Slumberdown and Farne Salmon and Trout have expanded their work forces. I welcome the news—I am not sure how much news it is in the Borders—that Mainetti is doubling its work force, taking on an extra 35 people and moving into new premises. I was delighted to receive an invitation to open that new plant later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many smaller businesses are thriving. Last year Scottish Borders Enterprise helped 239 new businesses to set up, creating 385 new jobs, and it is working with 13 electronics companies. Environmental support is another growth area. The Centre for Sustainable Development at Newton St. Boswells attracted 18 companies employing 80 people, with the aim of encouraging further company development and company birth through technology transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those developments point to sectors in which further growth can occur and to the success of some work that is being done. I readily admit that there is a need to review how the Borders can be further helped. The problems are well known, and include low population density, peripherality and lack of specific advantages to attract new employers. The sparsity of population and the absence of a huge pool of labour with specific skills reduces the attractiveness of the area to new employers. That is a fundamental problem for Locate in Scotland in marketing the Borders and other rural areas to potential inward investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often said that assisted area status, to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire rightly referred, would change the fortunes of the Borders. It might be a mistake to assume that that would answer the hon. Gentleman's prayers. Many areas, including my constituency, have had that status for 15 years or more and still suffer from persistently high unemployment. The hon. Gentleman will doubtless recognise that unemployment in many areas of Scotland is still worse than that of the Borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New European guidelines require the Government to reconsider the areas that should qualify for assisted area status. We have to reduce the total area covered across Britain. I shall not raise false expectations; the process is long term, and we have to seek more immediate measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I would be wrong to characterise the area as having been completely neglected in terms of assistance. As I said, the support has been more targeted. For example, the area was designated as a 5b area under the European structural funds, and was targeted with a programme worth £21 million between 1994 and 1999. That makes it eligible for a whole range of grants to help to develop economic diversification. For example, the area is eligible for RETEX II funding to assist diversification away from textiles, and £600,000 has been secured to date.

I do not say that as a defence, but to try to give a more balanced picture. The Borders are not completely cut off from such assistance. Under the allocation of LEC budgets, Scottish Borders Enterprise received an increased budget. I know that that is appreciated in a tight year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was cut last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were not here last year. However, I recognise that recent job losses necessitate further action and we are pleased to announce today that Hawick will be designated as an area within the property employment support programme, which is designed to encourage private sector commercial property developments in areas facing economic difficulty. That is relevant to the property-related issues that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire raised. It involves the relaxation of guidelines on property interventions by local enterprise companies, so that they may assist property projects even if they include a measure of economic activity from outside the designated area. I do not pretend that that alone will transform the economic prospects of Hawick, but, taken with other measures, it is a useful tool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that. It is a welcome change, which I understand will give more flexibility to the local enterprise company. To avoid doubt, will the Minister confirm that it does not necessarily bring new money with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The initiative does not, but it gives access to money that is allocated to the programme. I am not over-egging the pudding by saying that it is a useful measure and I hope that it is seen as useful both in symbol and substance.

I am conscious of the time and want to give one or two specific answers. The position with the new deal is a little better than was suggested. The latest figures show that 65 companies have started in the borders since the new deal began in April out of a total of 95 clients in January. That is an impressive take-up rate. The new deal can be as successful in the borders as anywhere else as people are now getting into it.

I shall not answer in detail the questions raised by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale in a letter, and again this evening, about assistance to ISL, which owns Via Systems. I shall write to him on the detailed points in his letter and I assure him that my officials and those in the Department of Trade and Industry are monitoring the position closely to ensure that the terms of the grant aid to ISL are not breached.

I want to say something about Scottish Borders Enterprise to assure members of the Committee that I am asking Scottish Enterprise to consider what further action can be taken to strengthen its presence in and commitment to the borders. We are looking for short-term yet practical measures that will be useful in strengthening the role of economic development agencies in the borders. Perhaps in another age some of the more ambitious proposals can be looked at, but even if they were examined at present, nothing could be provided in the short term. What I can do now is ask Scottish Enterprise what action it might take in recognition of the problems that are developing in the Borders.

I have a couple of minutes left so I can deal quickly with one or two other points that were raised, such as Hawick community hospital. I understand that the health board, trust and SBC are currently considering site options, but no commitments can be given to its construction until those have been considered, the business case completed and funding secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the council and local community are keen for the Hawick traffic relief scheme to progress, but some objections have been received locally, so there may need to be a public local inquiry, which will inevitably cause delay. We hope that that can be resolved as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my remarks will be useful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and his constituents, but the main value of the debate is to give him and his hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale the opportunity to air their problems and to ensure that they are given proper recognition. I am anxious to work with others to turn those difficulties around. They are not unmanageable. The Borders have many advantages and assets to develop, but clearly there are particular problems in the knitwear industry, not all of which are in the gift of the Government to resolve. I think that everyone would agree that we should all be talking and doing everything we can to limit the extent of that damage. Similarly, we should try to identify why things have gone wrong in the electronics industry and, if possible, stem that tide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
