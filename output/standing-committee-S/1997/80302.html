	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin questions, I ask that questions and answers be kept as brief as possible. This item of business will finish at 11.15 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State was asked</i>—</p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Diabetes (Screening)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr David Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What advice he has received from the United Kingdom national screening committee on the introduction of a national screening programme for diabetes among high risk groups. [30329]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Sam Galbraith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The national screening committee has not yet considered national screening for diabetes but will do so as part of its future programme in the light of emerging evidence. Any decision on the introduction of a national programme will be made in the light of that consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that constructive reply. In planning future health services in Scotland, will he consider high-risk screening programmes for diabetes before the onset of diabetes? Will he consider screening the over-40s and the overweight and looking into their family histories? As the Minister knows, diabetes is a major cause of blindness among those aged under 65 in Scotland. Nearly 50 per cent. of non-traumatic amputations result from diabetes. High-risk screening would benefit the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend who is well known for his campaign on diabetes and the onset of diabetes. As he said, it is important to target those who are at risk rather than having across-the-board screening. Such questions will be considered by the national screening advisory committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Housing (Scotland)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he last met Shelter (Scotland), Scottish Homes and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to discuss housing and homelessness in Scotland. [30330]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Office Ministers are in frequent contact with Shelter, Scottish Homes and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I look forward to meeting Liz Nicholson, Director of Shelter, next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why are the Government reducing overall investment in housing and imposing a 75 per cent. debt repayment regime at a time when there are rising numbers of homeless persons? As the Scottish housing conditions survey points out, substantial investment is needed to bring Scottish housing up to modern standards. Will the Government either adjust or dump the 75 per cent. rule to free much-needed resources for Scottish housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken in some of his figures. The latest homelessness figures show a slight fall from 31,000 to 30,000. That is still much too high, but it is not increasing. Likewise, he is wrong to say that we are reducing spending on housing—it will increase next year by £40 million. That will not restore the level of housing investment achieved in earlier years, but it means that the decline during the past few years has been halted and reversed. Private investment in housing is another important factor and is expected to be around £130 million next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the only realistic hope for the homeless lies in the social rented sector, which is dominated by more than 600,000 council houses? Is so, does he agree that the Tory rule that insisted that 75 per cent. of capital receipts should be used to reduce borrowing rather than invest in housing is sucking hundreds of millions of pounds out of investment? The hands of local authorities are tied and they are prevented from coming to terms with the homelessness problem in Scotland. Will he review the situation urgently and make an early announcement scrapping that Tory rule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 75 per cent. set-aside rule is being considered as part of a comprehensive spending review. However, I must tell my hon. Friend that a reduction to 50 per cent. would result in the Scottish block paying about £50 million extra, which would have to be recovered either from rental income to cover the debts that have not been redeemed or from the Scottish block, preventing its use for other purposes. I take my hon. Friend's point and we are considering the rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend has not been in his job long, but what plans does he have to democratise Scottish Homes if more representatives from housing associations are not involved in its strategic decision making? Will he urge Scottish Homes this afternoon to avoid delays in the negotiations on the funding of housing association projects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most important single advance in making Scottish Homes democratically accountable is to have a Government who represent the people of Scotland. We now have that and, from next year, we will have a Scottish Parliament—an Executive to whom Scottish Homes will be accountable. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend that it is important for Scottish Homes to work in partnership and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0926">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
consultation with housing associations. Indeed, we want all sectors dealing with housing in Scotland to work together in partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Scottish Parliament (Accessibility)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What plans he has to ensure that the new Scottish Parliament and its precincts are fully accessible to those with mobility difficulties. [30331]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new Scottish Parliament building and its environs will be accessible to all, including people with special needs. We will apply the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1996 to the design of the Parliament building and the site at Holyrood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I pay tribute to the symbolic significance of this building and the valiant efforts that have focused on it in the crusade for devolution, does my right hon. Friend agree that we are correct to have a purpose-built parliamentary building that will be fully accessible to those like my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg), who have mobility problems, and that will be adequate for the needs of Members of the Scottish Parliament, the media and the public? Does he also agree that we should take those factors into account when considering a temporary venue while the new parliamentary building is being built?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I assure him that those factors will be an important consideration, especially when a decision is taken on the Parliament's temporary premises. I was astonished by the nationalists' response to the suggestion of a site in Glasgow. I do not believe that a sensible person would find that proposal an insult to the city of Glasgow, as has been suggested. I can only think that that view is based on blind prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it is inevitable that the Scottish Office has to take the lead in evaluating and proposing sites, does the Secretary of State accept that Parliament's temporary site is a good example of something that should be subject to full consultation among the parties, and in particular by the consultative steering group? Will he assure the Committee on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that, of course, we will talk to the consultative steering group and, as the name suggests, consult it. The group was told that at its last meeting—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It has been told that that consideration will be an item on the agenda. I can also say—as the hon. and learned Gentlman knows—that I spoke to him, the leader of the Scottish National party and, indeed, the spokesman for the Scottish Conservative party as soon as it became clear, after reports from officials, that there was a runner in Glasgow which should be considered along with Edinburgh sites.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that concern about disabled access is comon and that all three interim sites under consideration for the Parliament will have to have adequate disabled access for people with mobility difficulties—not just for Members, but for visitors. As for consultation, can he guarantee that we are talking about a genuine consultation and not about using the consultative steering group as a rubber-stamp body? If he looks forward a year to the opening of our first national legislature for 300 years, when the eyes of the world will be turned on Scotland, does he really think that it will be appropriate to present a building that looks like a tower block, and which, was once opened and occupied by a local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to discuss those matters fully with everyone of good will. I find it a little disconcerting, after I have announced that there are three options to discuss, to have debate by press release and an absolute no before those who issued the press release had any opportunity to consider the evidence or the briefing material from those who have been investigating possible sites. It is important that within the first 18 months or two years the Scottish Parliament has a home which is appropriate, encourages good working practices and bonds the Parliament to a common cause—the good governance of Scotland. We must consider the matter against that background of practicality and suitablity. I would like to believe, although the evidence is against it, that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will approach the matter in that sprit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Class Sizes</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What plans he has to reduce class sizes in primary schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that during the lifetime of the present Parliament we shall reduce class sizes in the first three years of primary school to a maximum of 30. My officials have entered detailed discussions with local authorities towards that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Begg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my comments by saying that access for disabled people here leaves much to be desired and that is why I am sitting in the public gallery and not with my colleagues. It is just as well that I am not a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The toilet is round a corner and down a hill. I ask hon. Members to imagine the indignity of being unable to go to the toilet on their own and then to tell me that the situation is ideal for the new Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the reply of my hon. Friend the Minister for Education and Industry on class sizes. It is obvious that there is a direct correlation between the size of classes and the raising of standards in schools. My question concerned the time scale and my hon. Friend has already answered that. I am pleased that by the end of the current Parliament we shall not see classes of more than 30 in years one, two and three in Scottish schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0927">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I identify with her comments on access which she made so cogently. That is a lesson to those who are responsible for the operation not only of Government buildings in Scotland, but of all places where public access is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a central part of our commitment to reduce class sizes in years one, two and three in primary schools and the money that has been saved from the assisted places scheme will go directly to the reduction of class sizes and is already going into early intervention in primary schools. That is a classic case of a Labour Government serving the many and not the few.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that reducing class sizes to zero by closing schools is a major problem, especially in rural areas? As the Government's first reaction to the countryside rally at the weekend was to declare that they would have a prejudice against the closure of rural schools, will the Minister tell us whether that policy will apply in Scotland and will resources be made available to local authorities to enable that to happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such matters are for the judgment of local authorities. As I said recently, one local authority in Scotland—Perth and Kinross, which is run by the hon. Gentleman's party—charges £180 for children to have music tuition; my local authority in North Ayrshire charges nothing. One local authority in Scotland wants to charge £15 a night to stay in a school hostel; other local authorities charge nothing. Those matters are for the judgment of local authorities. The opportunism of the Scottish National party is, as ever, to attack other local authorities when they close small schools, but SNP authorities are quite good at doing that and I have had a lot of correspondence opposing cuts by SNP authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Scottish Parliament (Freedom of Information)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will seek to ensure that the proposed freedom of information will apply to matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Freedom of information about devolved matters will be determined by the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will agree that there should be an early introduction of such legislation and that that will help to change the current secrecy of Departments. It may even help us to find out where the new Scottish Parliament will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. and learned Friend about the importance of freedom of information. It is absolutely right that the Scottish Parliament should decide what freedom of information arrangements are appropriate in the areas for which they have legislative competence. It is important to account for the comments in the White Paper that was published recently. It will be for the Scottish Parliament to determine the approach of the Scottish Executive and other Scottish public bodies to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
openness and freedom of information within devolved areas in which it is competent to enact primary legislation. It is important to emphasise that no post-war Government have done so much to involve people in the future Parliament that will serve this country. We have involved political parties and civic Scotland; that process will continue. Inclusivity should be the hallmark of the Parliament; everything that we have done so far reinforces that central concept. I am convinced that it is the best way forward. We want a Parliament to be proud of, in which all Scots can feel ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Government's welcome commitment to freedom of information extend to releasing Scottish Office documents about Sean Connery? Does the Minister believe that it is acceptable that Mr. Connery—or anyone else—should be discriminated against because of his politics? Was any Scottish Office Minister involved in the disreputable briefing campaign against Mr. Connery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As far as I can see, that has nothing to do with the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. My question was whether the Government's commitment to freedom of information would mean the release of information about Scottish Office documents. Anxiety not to discuss the matter should not extend to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is about freedom of information legislation, not the disclosure of information. Moreover, I inform all hon. Members that the granting of knighthoods and honours is a matter for Her Majesty the Queen. It is a matter of royal prerogative, and is therefore not something that we can discuss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Scottish Parliament will be responsible for drawing up freedom of information rules and establishing scrutiny committees. Will he assure the Committee that no powers or executive functions will be transferred to the Scottish Executive until the Scottish Parliament has had time to establish the necessary methods of freedom of information and scrutiny to ensure that decisions taken by that Executive are properly accountable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Scottish Executive will be held fully accountable. With regard to the Scotland Bill, there will be a process of transition to the new Parliament in Edinburgh, which will be the subject of several orders. It is vital that we have a sensible transition and that when legislative competence and executive functions are located within the Holyrood Parliament, we have maximum openness and honesty in government. Freedom of information will be crucial in ensuring that we start off on the right foot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A recent parliamentary answer implied that it would cost £25 million extra to bring forward completion of the land register in Scotland to 2000. As there is broad cross-party agreement that land reform is vital, will he now consider introducing, to borrow a phrase from Wales, a bonfire of the quangos in Scotland to release some of the money that is essential to effect the process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for drawing attention to a long-standing problem. I am not sure, however, that a bonfire of titles is quite how I would describe it. As she knows, the Scottish Law Commission has a long-awaited report, which I understand will appear this year. We shall closely and urgently examine its recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that the report of the land reform policy group is a considerable step forward. It has been widely welcomed; it raises several fundamental questions and invites a public response, which I hope will be forthcoming. In the meantime, however, the land unit that has been established for Highlands and Islands Enterprise provides a great deal of help and support for those interested in community and land ownership in the highlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hereditary feudal superior of the barony of Eyemouth, I put it to my right hon. Friend that the Scottish feudal system is a ludicrous anachronism that is wide open to serious abuse, as has been demonstrated by the so-called raider of the lost titles in Lanarkshire and the northeast? Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the Government intend in the first session of the Scottish Parliament at last to abolish the feudal system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that I never regard him as a living anachronism—although occasionally as an irritation, and properly so in his constituents' interests. Of course, we are committed to reform—we have tried to expedite the necessary information and we shall act quickly, as time permits, after the appearance of the Law Commission report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that any proposals for land reform must take account of the interests and traditional activities of climbers, walkers and anglers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a more broad issue, but I am sympathetic to my hon. Friend's point. Clearly, many people rightly feel strongly about access to the countryside—and I hope that progress will be made in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>New Deal (Rural Areas)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>7. 	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What steps he is taking to overcome difficulties faced by new deal clients in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are determined to ensure that the new deal is delivered effectively in rural areas. Through the rural issues sub-group of the Secretary of State's new deal advisory task force for Scotland, we are already tackling a number of key issues including seasonality of work and transport costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. I hope that he truly understands that the main problem with the delivery of the new deal in rural areas is the lack of transport and the existence of seasonal jobs. Does he accept the recommendation of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs that the new deal should take account of seasonal work patterns, and that all transport costs, under all the sections should be met?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am please to tell the hon. Lady that we have taken account of seasonality, which I discussed with the Select Committee when I appeared before it. There will be sufficient flexibility in the scheme to take account of seasonal employment. Someone who is employed habitually for part of the year, but who is unemployed, under the normal meaning of the word, in the long term over several years, will be able to join the new deal early without always meeting the six-month stipulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also considering transport costs. The £300 million that Scotland will receive under the new deal could be used flexibly to meet transport costs—the rural sub-group is considering that matter—and we have already received assurances from some transport operators that free or half-price transport will be provided. The question is very much alive, and it is being addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that Tayside was selected as a pathfinder area because of its rural and urban mix. How many permanent jobs will result from that scheme in Tayside, which is split between the cities of Perth and Dundee, and the rest of the region, which could be loosely be described as rural?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot project in that way, but I imagine that any division would be roughy pro rata between the people who are eligible for the new deal in Dundee and those who are eligible in rural areas. The pathfinder scheme in Tayside brings much positive news. Within six weeks of the start of the scheme, 50 people have found jobs—real jobs. We have not yet gone through the gateway period, but people are already benefiting. About 225 employers in Tayside have signed up for the new deal and employers have registered more than 600 jobs with the scheme. The results are very positive and we are learning lessons from the scheme that will help in its application to rural areas. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that Tayside was chosen because of its combination of rural and urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) aware that all the travel companies have played their part in ensuring that travel features highly in the options that are available? The pathfinder scheme in Tayside is a good example of private and public partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend, who has been actively involved in ensuring the success of the scheme in Tayside. In some contexts, partnership is a cliche, but it is a prerequisite for the success of the new deal in Scotland. If all the public agencies work well together and fully involve the private sector, there is no doubt that the new deal will be extremely effective in realising its aim of breaking the curse of long-term unemployment among young people once and for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Health boards are not required to submit information routinely on delayed discharges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that Lothian health board does so. My question was fairly simple: I asked whether any other health boards do so, not whether they had to do so. With due respect, I know that information on this matter exists, so I was somewhat concerned to receive a written answer from the Minister to say that no such information existed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman is making. If he is saying that there is a problem with delayed discharges, that is something that we all recognise. It is not a new problem, but recently the Government spent £3.5 million in his own health board to try to deal with it. Almost half a million pounds was allocated to open 46 beds in nursing homes. We recognise the problem and have allocated extra money for it. We have the best interests of the patients at heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will know that Tayside health board was recently forced to make an emergency closure of a private nursing home because its residents were at risk from poor hygiene standards. Is he also aware that the health boards themselves have commented that the legislation regulating private nursing homes is hopelessly outdated and in need of reform? When can we expect action to update the regulations, and to ensure that private nursing home scandals are brought to an end?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and it is not just the narrow issue of regulations and standards. We are considering introducing comprehensive legislation to deal with a whole range of issues arising from nursing homes, residential homes and planning permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to clarify that waiting lists were published in England but not in Scotland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Representations have been received from one company concerned about the viability of some European flights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister seen the figures produced by the British Airports Authority and the Scotch Whisky Association? The BAA figures especially show that the reduction in duty free sales would lead to a loss of income and have an impact on external flights, which some of us have experienced at Inverness. As Scotland is to have its own Parliament, it should look outwards and have more international links not fewer. Duty free sales are an important aspect of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the reports mentioned by the hon. Lady. There has been considerable debate about these matters over many years. ECOFIN and the Finance Ministers decided in 1991 that the duty should be abolished, and it was determined that that should be delivered in the period between 1 January 1993 and 30 June 1999. Some of the figures are speculative, but we have had discussions with BAA and others on the matter. It is now absolutely vital to ensure that the adjustments that must be made relating to the abolition of the duty are given serious consideration. The questions of how to raise revenue and how to pay for operating costs at airports will have to be reconsidered. The question of duty is the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have stated that we would not oppose any move by the Commission to set up a study of the effects of abolishing duty free sales. The Government would not stand in the way of any Commission proposals, especially any that were to examine the nature of any successor to the duty free regime. Sadly, at this stage, no scheme is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My officials have discussed the terms of a draft concordat with MAFF officials and on financial assistance to industry with the DTI. I placed copies of guidance for Departments setting out the main principles which might govern such non-statutory agreements in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament on 27 February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State undertake to publish the various agreements and concordats that are being arranged in the name of the new Scottish Parliament with Whitehall Departments? Does the concordat with MAFF confirm the Ministry's leading role in European negotiations and does the Secretary of State believe that that is appropriate, given that the fishing industry, for example, is dominated by Scottish producers, and that various documents, including previous documents on devolution, refer to Scotland playing a leading role on appropriate occasions? Will he undertake to meet representatives of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, who are anxious about what will happen to their access to European decision making if the Secretary of State refuses to guarantee the Scottish Parliament that access in the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear in my first answer that discussions with MAFF officials on that matter were continuing. There is a general expectation that a range of agreements will be published, but that is not universal. There may be difficulties, for example, with law and order matters, but there is a general commitment to publication. The agreements will not become binding until they have been seen by the Scottish Parliament, which must be a signatory to them. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I would not refuse to see and, to the best of my knowledge, have not refused to see, any delegation from the fishing industry. If such a delegation wishes to see me, they should get in touch, and I shall consider their case. I am sure that that can be done directly, without going through the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The resources come largely from savings that have already been made on the assisted places scheme, from which typically penny numbers of pupils—I believe that it is 17 in my constituency and I

[30538]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new deal gateway will provide a wide range of support and advisory services to meet the individual needs of young people. This will help to maximise the benefit they obtain from the programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his answer. Will he consider in particular the needs of young unemployed mothers, such as those whom he met on his successful visit to my constituency a few weeks ago? Such young women have a mountain to climb before they get to the gateway because of the difficulty of finding child care, both before their children are five and afterwards, when they need after-school care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The event organised by my hon. Friend in Maryhill was superb. The difference between that and other events involving the new deal was that it was aimed at the client group, many of whom came along. The event provided further evidence of the enthusiasm for the new deal among young unemployed people, who ask the sort of questions that matter. I am sure that the event contributed greatly to the credibility of the new deal and to the willingness of young people to give it a fair chance. My hon. Friend is right about the particular problems faced by young mothers, who are anxious to be part of the new deal, but obviously need support with child care. That was reflected in the discussions. I assure the hon. Lady that help with child-care will be available for all options under the new deal. Participants who receive a wage will be eligible under the normal rules for family credit and its child-care disregard, which will increase from June 1998 for those with two or more children. That is one of the measures that makes it possible for women with young children who are eligible to take part in the new deal to do so. Such measures give the new deal credibility among young unemployed people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister reflected on the conclusions of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee in relation to compulsion in the new deal? Does he have any further advice for the Committee on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Compulsion is not the word that I would use. Four options are on offer to everyone who takes up the new deal and anyone who chooses to have nothing to do with any of them will face a benefit penalty. That is not an issue or a source of great concern on the ground. From going round and talking to people about the new deal, I know that the vast majority of young unemployed people want to work;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0931">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
they do not want the non-existent fifth option. They want decent opportunities, quality programmes and monitoring by trade unions, for instance. They want helplines so that there is an instant point of contact if there are problems with any of the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people value everything that has been put into the new deal and recognise that it is better and different. As long as the Government deliver quality in the new deal—that is my absolute commitment—client groups will not make an issue out of the fact that they do not have the right to say, "I do not want anything to do with this. I will just claim maximum benefit instead." That is not the attitude of young people and it should not be the attitude of anybody in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Domestic Violence</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>13. 	<div class='member'>Ms Osborne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the policy of the Scottish Office in relation to the inclusion of domestic violence in the diversion scheme. [30539]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish Office policy in relation to pilot diversion schemes is that, in principle, no particular category of offender should be excluded from consideration. The decision on whether an offender should be diverted from prosecution is, of course, a matter for my noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Osborne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Does he agree that our priority should be the protection of women who are abused and that we should send a clear message that domestic violence is wrong? Does he recall that, in the 19th century, a man could beat his wife with a stick as long as it was no thinker than his thumb? The courts gave a clear message then that it was okay to batter one's wife; the Minister should give a clear message now that it is not. By definition, the pre-court diversion scheme does not send that message. Will the Minister reconsider his position in light of the zero tolerance justice campaign? Will he consult women's organisations that deal with abused women?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share all my hon. Friend's concerns, and we recently had a constructive meeting on the matter. The diversion schemes are appropriate in specific cases. It should be possible for courts to make a judgment in relation to criminal justice social work on the advice that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, I want to take the opportunity to highlight the fact that domestic violence is a criminal act; it is an abhorrent, despicable crime. That is why the Government are giving it absolute priority in Scotland. Let me reinforce the importance of the issue: there has been an 80 per cent. increase in the number of rapes recorded in Scotland over the past 10 years—that is violence against women. In the same period, there has been a 25 per cent. increase in the number of indecent assaults against women. Overall, we have had
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
60,000 recorded cases of sexual crimes. That means that even if violence against women were not a Government priority, it would have to be—and it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are determined to make two new efforts over the next few months to bring the issue to the public and to change attitudes, particularly among young men, among whom it seems to be a problem. On 16 March, I will announce a new report in Fife on the services that we provide for people who suffer domestic violence. I also give the Committee an assurance that we will publish details by the summer of a new strategy in Scotland to deal with violence against women. That is a priority and I intend to make sure that it remains one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had an opportunity to consider the judgment of the Appeal Court last week, which established that previous convictions for harassment of women could not be taken into account in regard to a protection from harassment order? Does he accept that he would get full co-operation—at least from the Liberal Democrat party—in getting legislation to plug that loophole through the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the hon. and learned Gentlemen's comments. The Government are looking very closely at findings that relate to the McKinnon case and to the Appeal Court judgment. We have asked for reports from various officials and from the Crown Office. I again reassure the Committee that if there is a loophole, we will close it. We want to act with urgency. It is vital that women feel safe in their homes and in the streets of Scotland—I am committed to ensuring that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's strategy to tackle violence against women, which was announed in Friday's debate on women. Will the Minister consider my remarks about a Scottish strategy? I shall not repeat them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the specific issue raised, does the Minster accept that there is difference between post-court diversion schemes, which are perfectly acceptable and legitimate, and pre-court diversion schemes, which send out all the wrong messages about violence against women? Will he consider that issue, rather than just accept the policy inherited from the previous Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his work in the Scottish Office. I appreciate the distinction that he makes, but the Government are keen to consider pre-court diversion schemes through the pilot projects that we have established. Such schemes may be inappropriate for the overwhelming number of cases that come before them, but there should be an alternative. The Government will fully evaluate the outcome of the pilot projects when they are completed. We are committed to ensuring that the criminality involved is well understood. It is vital for us to change attitudes—I assure my hon. Friend that we are working very hard to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past two decades, local government has been under-resourced, undervalued and under siege. Since the last general election, only the rhetoric has changed, but the same old Tory policies continue. I believe that local government deserves better than that. We now need a new deal for local government which gives proper value, proper resources and proper status to a system that has served Scotland well, and to the services that are essential to both the democratic system and the daily lives of the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past two years, councils have faced the harshest budget settlement ever seen in Scotland. Over those years, both the Labour party and the Scottish Nationalist party agreed that the blame for cuts and closures lay with the Tory central Government. Both parties were vocal in their protest. But in Government, new Labour has stopped protesting about the cuts and is in fact now implementing them. The result will be seen in unemployment, closures and service cuts and in serious long-term damage to the country's infrastructure, cuts in local authority capital budget and the problems caused by the use of private finance initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year's Scottish Office settlement follows two years of swingeing cuts in local government budgets, with £300 million taken from local authorities and an estimated 17,000 jobs lost. Doing more with less is one thing, but asking for the impossible with less is a very different matter. As past underfunding has already cut many council services to the bone, this Scottish Office settlement is a direct attack on front-line services. The headline figures sum it up. New Labour is taking £150 million out of the Scottish economy, with an average 3 per cent. cut in council budgets, along with council tax increases likely to average around 6 per cent.—twice the rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the worst of all possible worlds—less money, poorer services and higher council taxes. It is a very poor deal for Scottish councils and the people whom they serve. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), the Under-Secretary, asks who wrote this. I did, and it is a message about which I have been consistent for many decades. I just wish that his party was more consistent in the message that it is giving the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Labour cannot escape the consequences of its actions. New Labour cannot blame anyone else because, in government, it now dominates and decides local authority decision making. These cuts are new Labour cuts; these job cuts are new Labour cuts; these services closures are new Labour service closures. This is all caused by central Government's deliberate financial policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Local authorities have little or no scope to fight back on behalf of their local communities. Scottish local government is not in control of its own finances. Central Government decides 85 per cent. of local government revenue; it slaps on capping controls as and when it pleases, with little or no scope for any real local revenue raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government also decide capital spend through borrowing consent and a 75 per cent. capital debt repayment regime. They have imposed new statutory duties on local authorities without providing them with the necessary resources to meet those new burdens. Central Government are now so dominant that we almost do not have any local government—merely local administration. The recent speech of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Western Isles, shows that the new Labour Government see local councils as enabling rather than servicing-providing organisations. Yet again, new Labour is adopting an old Tory policy—indeed, an old Tory mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be strengthening local democracy and accountability, not destroying it. A local authority system with no powers to raise finance or take decisions in accordance with local needs and aspirations is clearly flawed, yet the Government have ignored a request from a range of academics and organisations, including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish National party, that finance be included in the remit of the independent commission on local government. Again, I ask for an assurance that the commission will be allowed to study the financial relationship between central and local government. That must happen if there is to be hope for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government controls neither its own finances, whether revenue or capital, nor its own work load, as more than 75 per cent. of local expenditure goes on statutory services, which are determined by central Government. To their financial witches' brew central Government consistently add a series of new burdens. The net cost of the landfill tax is expected to be £18.5 million, but while the Scottish Office accepts that that is an additional financial pressure, it refuses to provide additional funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In July, the Chancellor removed the ability of pension funds to reclaim the tax credit on dividend income. That will result in Scottish councils having to pay an additional £36 million in employer contributions. No additional funding has been provided by the Government—indeed, they have inflicted new burdens—so the money will have to be found from other council service budgets. Moreover, new Labour is forcing the cost on to Scottish local authorities a year before it happens in England and Wales—we used to criticise the Tories for such behaviour in relation to the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cuts and closures in services and rising unemployment are the heavy prices Scotland and its local authorities will pay for new Labour's policy of imposing extra burdens while reducing available resources. While in opposition, new Labour vilified the Tories over local government's reorganisation costs.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
In government, however, it has accepted Tory figures, which it once attacked. The Secretary of State has even built the Tory figure of £40 million of so-called savings into his budget settlement. Yet again, new Labour and old Tory policies are indistinguishable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-financing public sector pay awards form a financial time bomb that is ticking under every Scottish local authority. They will have a direct and cumulative effect on services and finance. About half local government expenditure goes on wages; given that local government services are, by definition, labour intensive, the effects of the policy can only be disastrous for services and employment in Scotland. If public sector pay awards are finalised at three per cent.—as compared with an average earning index rise of 4.7 per cent.—local authority expenditure will be increased instantly by £100 million. That can be raised only by cutting services or sacking people—it has to have a direct effect on the services that local authorities deliver to the communities they serve. That unavoidable financial burden is additional to an under-provision of £350 million over the past four years, which means that councils have had to absorb a shortfall of £450 million over five years because of old Tory and new Labour central Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those problems are anything but small. The combined cost of identified but unfunded new burdens, including unfunded wage settlements, will total £165 million. That is almost enough to fund for one year Dundee city's budget of £180 million. A large penalty has been imposed on Scottish local government and, therefore, on services and on the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such underfunding will be paid for in cuts, closures and unemployment forced on Scottish local authorities by the new Labour Government—an ultimate irony for Labour-controlled councils. The result of the old Tory and new Labour settlements—it is difficult to distinguish between them—will be seen in the effects on services and capital budgets throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although budget details will not be finalised until Thursday, we have already seen examples of the horrific decisions faced by councillors and councils throughout Scotland. We are told that in Glasgow, there may be cuts of £46.3 million, a 14 per cent. rise in council tax, 780 redundancies, four secondary school closures, two nursery closures, the closure of 70 children's play areas and a 10 per cent. increase in cremation and burial charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Edinburgh, there may be 760 job losses. In North Lanarkshire, there may be cuts of £20 million and the possible closure of two residential homes for the elderly and a centre for the disabled. In Clackmannanshire, I am told that leisure services are to be outsourced to a trust and that a strike action ballot is under way. In West Lothian, industrial action is proposed because of the privatisation of leisure management. Two primary schools, public toilets and other facilities may be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I have chosen Labour-controlled councils as examples because they are in the majority. I am sure that none of them would want to contemplate taking any of the actions I have just described, but they find that their own Labour Government have under-resourced them into facing such horrendous decisions. They have no option, and they know who is to blame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy and proud to point out that the three SNP-controlled councils, although facing the same financial stringencies, have, through good housekeeping, managed to keep council taxes down while defending services. SNP-controlled Angus has one of the lowest council tax rates, and certainly the lowest average rents, in Scotland. In Angus, there will be no compulsory redundancies, no school closures and no closures of residential homes for the elderly. SNP-controlled councils have protected services and given value for money, but no council in Scotland is immune from the Government's under-resourcing of Scottish local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Labour is attacking the most vulnerable, by, for example, cutting £10 from benefits to children in single-parent families and by aiming to reduce disability benefits by £2.3 billion by April 2000. In local government as in central Government, new Labour's trend is to make cuts that affect the most vulnerable, such as cuts to social work departments and the closure of old folks' homes, and to increase charges for those reliant on social services. Those have become common themes in Labour-controlled councils, which I am sure Labour councillors would not have wanted forced on them by their own new Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to get right the balance of the argument regarding Labour-controlled councils, did not Perth and Kinross council privatise two old folks' homes under its previous budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those choices are forced on local councils by the new Labour Government, who are continuing old Tory policies. The hon. Gentleman may read the letters that I have received. Perth and Kinross was well to the fore in defending front-line services in its recent budget. No council is immune to the effect of the financial settlement made by the hon. Gentleman's Government. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is new or old Labour. If he is old Labour he must, like a few Labour councillors, be embarrassed and ashamed of what they are having to do about services for the people whom they are dedicated to serving. That embarrassment is caused by new Labour policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing conditions survey confirms at a time of rising homelessness that damp, overcrowding and poor energy efficiency are major problems. The Under-Secretary updated the homeless figure earlier, but admitted that it is far too high. One in three council houses require urgent repair, as the Government's own housing conditions survey confirms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Labour's response is an additional £29 million this year, which masks a massive £484 million cut over the past two years. The new Labour/old Tory policy of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
a 75 per cent. capital debt repayment regime robbed Scottish housing provision last year of £170 million—35 per cent. of the total housing budget. Labour's manifesto pledge to review the 75 per cent. rule appears to have been dumped. Local authorities are being denied the resources to meet people's needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most headlines focus on revenue budgets, but capital budgets have also been slashed. Capital consents are down by £130 million over the past three years, which is a real terms cut of 28 per cent. The effects will be seen as the country's infrastructure decays because of inadequate repair and investment. That is the sort of thing that Labour complained about when the Tories were in power, but is continuing to do in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most councils have made substantial cuts in road maintenance programmes. Parents, pupils and teachers are all too familiar with decaying school buildings. The Government may argue that they have increased the allocation for education, but new Labour has supplied finance inadequate to cover a multitude of its own, manifesto commitments. From the increase of £89 million, councils are expected to improve school buildings, implement early-years programmes, raise school standards, run teacher development programmes and education plans for schools, meet the manifesto commitment to improve information technology in schools, give all schools access to the internet and establish a national grid for learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those excellent goals are unrealistically ambitious, given the resources that the Government have allocated. Urgent school repairs in Renfrewshire alone require £25 million. The national allocation of £89 million will not go far. Renfrewshire will get only about £0.9 million for education, leaving a shortfall of about £24 million on urgent repairs—before all the Government's other projects have even been considered. The Government's vaunted additional money is but a drop in the ocean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Labour, old Tory: there is not much difference. That is not what people voted for at the general election when new Labour was given the trust of the people of Scotland. The settlement shows that that trust has been betrayed. New Labour and old Tory policies are the same simply because both parties are after the middle-England electorate whom they are pleasing with policies that are irrelevant to Scotland's interests and problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opposition, Labour rightly attacked the Tories on these issues. The right hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson)—now the Secretary of State for Defence and not with us today—then said of Michael Forsyth's budget:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He will say that they have overspent, not sacked enough people, not closed enough Old People's Homes and Schools, not been savage enough with Care in the Community and in axing Lunch Clubs. He will urge more charges for essential services, fewer amenities, less economic development efforts and the contracting out of everything from library books to Home Helps."</p></blockquote>
Michael Forsyth probably did not say such things. Nor is the Secretary of State saying them. However, such cuts, charges and closures are the results of their joint policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) described the Tory 1996–97 settlement as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the politics of the madhouse".</p></blockquote>
She was absolutely right. But I notice a distinct silence on new Labour's continuation of those Tory budgets cuts which, funnily enough, matches the new Trappist approach adopted by the leadership of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on the same isue. The new Labour Government are implementing the cuts for which they rightly condemned the outgoing Tories. Labour councillors are unable to do anything besides watch as their new Labour Government strangle public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP believes that the established network of expertise, experience and accountability in councils throughout Scotland should be strengthened and encouraged to provide a range of public services for the public good, in conjunction with the private and voluntary sectors. Councils deserve a better deal. They must be properly financed for the tasks allocated to them and made accountable to their local communities. Local government is too important to be treated in such a way by a highly centralised Westminster system. It is time for a new deal for Scotland's local authorities and the people whom they serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have heard that speech before, and I am not much encouraged by the thought that I will probably hear it many more times. It is interesting that the speech is the same however much the facts may have changed. There is a dogged determination about the hon. Gentleman's faith in his script.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with him on one point—I am happy to stress this area of agreement because there are few—that local government services are vital to the people of Scotland. On that there can be no dispute. We have had a number of debates in the House recently on that matter—only last week we debated local government finance and housing orders. I am happy to return to the subject today and I look forward, in the not too distant future, to discussing those matters more comprehensively in a Scottish Parliament as part of what I hope will be a more effective scrutiny system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to make it clear that I have great respect for what local governments have achieved in the bad times, the long winter and the dreich years of hostility, when disrespect and contempt for local government was the mark of Government. Colleagues in local government held to their priorities. They preserved the core of their services, and initiated and created opportunities for partnerships with communities. They pioneered new approaches to delivery of services and kept lines of communication open to the people. They deserve great credit for a struggle conducted with spirit and some dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I came to office, I was astonished—perhaps appalled would be a better word—to discover that many senior local government leaders had not been through the doors of St. Andrew's house in the last
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
five, six or seven years. The relationship between Government and local government must be a partnership. There is a common cause and we share agreed objectives. There must be a willingness to fight together and achieve together for the people whom we represent. But that partnership needs both sides to recognise the difficulties and challenges, and to meet them responsibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government know the value of local government and its role. We believe in devolution of power to and within Scotland. There is no question of local government being forced off the ground that it properly calls its own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is well aware of the terms and remit of the commission.

That is a substantial remit. It will, no doubt, issue a challenging and important report. It is right that the commission should deal with those matters and the relevant issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still surprised. Can the Secretary of State tell us who drafted the remit? At the very heart of the problem facing local government is the ability of the person who controls the purse strings to affect the democracy of the organisation. It is blindingly obvious to anyone who is or who has been involved in local government that the heart of the problem is the fact that the public cannot confront the council's spending decisions because they do not control its income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in a sense right, but do the Liberal Democrats believe that central Government should take no interest in what local government spends or raises? That is the thrust of his attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman who leads for the Liberal Democrats hurriedly helps out the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine with a small qualification. Of course a balance is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the question that the hon. Gentleman quite properly asks, the Government are responsible for the remit under which the commission was set up. There was extensive consultation with COSLA—some
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
of its members agrued strongly that the commission should have had a total remit to examine local government finance, but that view did not prevail. I look forward to a useful report, which will inform the decisions of the Scottish Parliament when it takes charge after the middle of 1999. We have had a good relationship with COSLA—that is in marked contrast with what went before. There has been some tough talking, and its members made their positions clear, as they are entitled, and as they are duty bound, to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the need to improve the delivery of service and to secure the best value regime, the person who matters above all is the one whe relies on or who needs the services that local government delivers. Council tax increases have to be controlled and the present runaway rate has slowed down. There is much common ground and much progress has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not really complain about the fact that the Opposition always ask for more—I have spent long enough in opposition, and I know the temptation. Asking for more is a mind set or a standing invitation that too often becomes an ingrained habit. However, with the nationalists, that habit is reinforced by the need to undermine and to discredit the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned the need to control council tax increases. We all appreciate the difficulties with which he wrestles, but the council in Perth and Kinross, which is in my constituency, cannot increase the council tax in the forthcoming financial settlement because of the capping regime. When council services are in decline, what kind of message does that send to the public? The council is prohibited because of the capping regime, which Labour Front Benchers condemned before the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes me a little away from the order in which I wanted to discuss those matters. He will know that there has been a significant increase in capping levels—by £191 million, which is 3·4 per cent. above last year's figures. We tried to make that capping level more flexible and, after representations with COSLA, we found a small addition, which was announced on 13 February—we found a futher 0·25 per cent. on top of the existing capping limit, provided that councils keep the increase in band D council tax below the likely Scottish average. If one compares the capping regime during the last year of the Conservative Government with the increased levels that we have found on this occasion—our proposals involve increased flexibility and progressiveness—one will see that within the limits that we can afford we have done a great deal to help councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that people will always ask for more, but I did not feel that I was being effectively savaged by the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh). I have described the situation reasonably. He referred to completely unrealisitc targets, but he is an expert in unrealistic targets—he set many in his speech. He talked about new Labour and old Labour. Judging by his comments, the nationalists are in a time warp. He placed much store by the fact that the delivery of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
service had to be done in one way, and in one way only. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles said that the way that service is delivered should be conditioned by what is right for those who receive it. The elected representatives on the council have to take those decisions. If the hon. Gentleman wants to criticise that approach, he is a brave man, but he is obviously living in an out-of-date world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The opposite is true. I want local authorities to have more choice to deliver the best low-cost, high-quality services, but that choice is being restricted by central Government. The problem is that local authorities are under-resourced for the sevices imposed on them by Government. The Secretary of State seems to be complacent about the package that he has produced. Has he said what he said this morning to Unison workers, who do not agree with him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was criticising us because he thought that we were suggesting that local government could enable services as well as provide them directly. The answer is that it is a mix, but it is a matter entirely for local government. I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman. I accept that we inherited Tory plans and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, unless he is determined to ignore the figures, we altered them. Central Government grant to local authorities—that is, their aggregate external finance figure—was set by the previous Government to fall in cash terms during the coming year by more than 1 per cent. and expenditure was set to rise by only 0.7 per cent., even taking into account additional resources, such as £24.5 million for community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospects for local authorities under that settlement were extremely difficult. We increased the Government grant for the year 1998–99 by more than £90 million, mostly targeted to our shared priority, education. We have allowed local authorities additional spending power of £150 million over and above the inherited plans. We have found an additional £4 million for early-learning initiatives next year. Schools are to receive an extra £27 million for capital expenditure to help reverse the years of neglect to which the hon. Member for Angus referred. I recognise that that is not enough for the hon. Gentlemen, but he should at least recognise that these provisions are being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall aggregate external finance is now set to increase by more than £33 million and Government supported expenditure will increase by £133 million. Of even more importance to councils, if they finalise the budget, is the £191 million—or 3.4 per cent. increase in captial expenditure—that I was able to allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the hon. Member for Angus is entitled to say that that is not enough, but he must recognise that there are good economic reasons for emphasising the need to keep public expenditure on a sound footing; in order to build a base that will facilitate future progress. We must get rid of the old habit of plunging into boom and bust, which would certainly follow if we accepted the hon. Gentleman's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
The country must not be allowed to become a victim of recession and economic instability. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that we should find a lot more money, irrespective of the consequences, he does no service to those who work in local government, those who rely on their services and the general public, because if we did that, we would quickly find ourselves back in the situation of having to retrench, and none of us wants that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus talked about new burdens. I have already referred to community care and to the figure of £24.5 million included in the budget to cover that. The hon. Gentleman will remember that there are several other new burdens; Pennington, for example, was also specifically financed, as well as the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned at least in passing. An additional £24 million was added to the social work grant-aided expenditure over the past four years in recognition of the costs of preparing and implementing that Act. As one of the decisions taken for the 1998–99 settlement, I increased the Children's grant-aided expenditure by a further £4.5 million. I do not object to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Adjustments in the budget are one thing, but if the overall budget is going down, new burdens can be financed only by the withdrawal of services or creation of a problem elsewhere in the system. The Secretary of State is doing the same trick as his predecessor; juggling between budget headings while the overall figures are going down. That is the problem of under-resourcing that faces local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It it like talking to a wall. I have tried to explain that councils' earning power has risen by 3.4 per cent. from last year. I suppose it is unfair to ask the Opposition spokesman to be fair, but I should at least ask him to look at the figures. I know that he is a genuine little man, so I am beginning to suspect that he has not looked at the figures. That must be the explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has given us some figures in cash terms—his predecessor was very good at giving the Committee such figures—but will he give us some real-terms figures for 1997–98?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned the 3.4 per cent. increase in earning power and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can make his own deduction. It is a substantial increase on what was planned and what was spent last year, but I accept that there are problems. The hon. Member for Angus referred to the changes to the advance corporation tax regime as though there were a conspiracy against Scotland. There is a problem because the auditor is demanding an increase in certain payments to compensate for the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman failed to mention that the debt rescheduling arrangements that will take effect in 1998–99 will be worth £65 million to local authorities. That has been left with local authorities and will be a considerable protection for the council tax figures. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
a matter of balance. I do not mind being attacked, but I should be attacked on the basis of facts and not prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend sits down, may I plead for a substantial increase in the mental illness specific grant? He knows that that grant allows local authorities to implement rehabilitation programmes for those who have suffered head injuries and receive the sort of treatment that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), used to mete out to patients. The mental illness specific grant south of the border has been increased substantially and I urge my right hon. Friend to consider sympathetically the representations made for a substantial increase to the grant in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I protest a little at the picture of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland inflicting injuries on his patients. If he did, it was in a good cause. I suppose that people are judged on the result and I confidently believe that if that test is applied to the Government's policies we shall see good results for the country and for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the importance of the grant and we are committed to continuing it. I cannot make a promise now about increased funding, but it plays a significant part in an area of great sensitivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to housing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been generous and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but I am aware that others wish to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that much remains to be done on housing and that 700,000 households in social rented housing in Scotland are concerned. The hon. Gentleman referred to the housing conditions survey which was published towards the end of last year and underlined the tasks that lies ahead. The hon. Gentleman produced a spectacular figure which I believe he took from a Shelter brief. All Oppositions plagiarise and pick up what they can—I did so in my time, so I make no complaint—but the hon. Gentleman did not reveal the whole picture. He may have been unintentionally unfair when he referred to a reduction of £484 million between the two-year period from 1995–96, 1996–97 and 1997–98, 1998–99. That sounds spectacular, but I shall give one qualfication as an example, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will accept. In earlier years, the non-housing revenue account figure was ring-fenced. During that period the figure was around £125 million, which has now been taken out of housing finance and placed in the single capital allocation to local authorities. The hon. Gentleman can take that out and I hope that I never again hear him referring to the £484 million without that important qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
As was mentioned during Question Time earlier, we have started a modest recovery. The figure for capital of £230 million is likely to be about £7 million or £8 million higher than last year. Compared with the general picture under the previous Government, that reflects modest progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we have found an extra £66 million, to address a range of priority use issues, which I am sure the hon. Member for Angus will want to commend. As part of the new deal to assist local authorities to make their houses more energy efficient, we have provided £7.5 million. A total of £10 million has been allocated to our empty homes initiative; more has gone to the rough sleepers' initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About £45 million has been provided for new housing partnerships, £35 million of which falls into the financial year 1998–99. If we are to make an impact on the housing problem, we cannot be confined by ideology. We must use that money to attract and lever in private sector capital. Ultimately, the only criteria are the standard of housing and the number of rehabbed and new homes that we can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps Scottish National Members do not like the idea of the use of private capital to improve housing standards in Scotland, as their attack on the thrust of housing policy implied. However, I stand firmly by the rule that my only aim is to catch up with the backlog and failure of the past to move forward in a way that I hope will be acceptable to the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bids for the £35 million are now being assessed by a panel. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Angus suspects some terrible conspiracy; I had better spell out that the panel includes representatives from COSLA, Scottish Homes, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations Ltd. and the Chartered Institute of Housing. Although they may all be biased and blinded from reality, it is unlikely. It is another example of the effort that the Government are making in many different areas to build partnerships and to involve everyone in the fight for higher standards in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that by April we shall be able to announce a range of partnership projects that will deliver quality housing for tenants in the social rented sector, that will be attractive to private sector funders and that can be replicated across the country. Those partnerships—a theme of this Government—will involve central Government, local government, Scottish Homes, local authorities, tenants and the private sector. The Government are not window dressing. There has been a genuinely constructive, at times spiky and difficult, but always determined, dialogue between COSLA and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dumping scheme, which largely took ut of the equation the rather arbitrary impact of changes in the social work GAE and the decline of mismatch funds, was an example of that partnerhip and reflects great credit on councils. I am grateful for their mature approach to the settlement and to addressing council tax problems. It looks as though the average will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0939">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
about 7 per cent. Such a figure has been announced, but not honoured, in the past. On this occasion, I believe that we will approach that figure. I hope that there will be improvement in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that in the newspapers today, on which I must rely on this occasion, a spokesman for COSLA made it clear that that figure is significantly lower than it otherwise would have been because of the sort of changes and additions to inherited plans to which I refer. Despite his best efforts and great energy, it is simply not true, as the hon. Member for Angus suggested, that the change of Government has not made a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that many have felt ambivalent about the process, but we are all in the same business. I hope wistfully that we might be able to involve the nationalists, not necessarily in agreement, but at least in dialogue. However, as has been illustrated by the extraordinary attitude taken to the temporary home for a Scottish Parliament before the representatives have heard the briefing, seen the material or assessed any sites, it is difficult—sadly—to talk about constructive diagogue with Scottish National Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue to build with local government. We share a common interest in raising standards; we have common purposes. We shall move forward in that partnership. The question of public expenditure will not go away easily. A strong and growing economy will be necessary to meet out expenditure priorities in the future. I am confident that a great deal can be done and that we can win this battle. I ask Committee to support the Government's efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie (Argyle and Bute)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate the Scottish National party on selecting this subject, which is of great importance and, as the Secretary of State said, has already been debated at some length in the House of Commons. I would like to take the opportunity today to highlight some matters relating to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the £24.5 million for care in the community, but it does not compensate for the many cuts that have already taken place. Social work faces immense difficulties in funding care packages for individuals, either in the home or in residential care. One of the most mean-minded cuts brought to my attention was that of home helps being told that they were not to light the fires of their clients any longer. Many of those whose principal source of heating and hot water is an open fire—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that that is one of the most mean-minded cuts she has come across. Making such a cut would by a matter for the local authority. Will she say which local authority was responsible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: it was my own local authority—Argyll and Bute—and occurred on one of the islands. I was critical of the decision because it is not easy for an 84year-old partially blind man, who suffers from arthritis and whose wife is confined to a wheel-chair, to accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
such a cut. According to COSLA, the financial difficulties being faced by councils will inevitably lead to further job losses and service reductions, combined with increased charges for a whole range of services. There is no better example of that than my own constituency, where school meal charges are to rise by 15 per cent., burial charges are up by 16 per cent., the council tax increase is likely to be the highest percentage increase in Scotland, and on the Argyll and Bute islands—this will be of interest to the Minister with responsibility for local government—council tax band D is £801 whereas in the Western Isles it is £599.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Argyll has traditionally been under-funded and lacking in investment since the days of the old Argyll county council. Strathclyde region refused to take responsibility for the hundreds of miles of unadopted roads; they are still in the same unsuitable state. I see some hon. Members—probably formerly involved in Strathclyde region—saying "Oh!" but they should look back to 1976 when Strathclyde region took that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New developments in fish farming are destroying the roads, just as forestry lorries do every day. Nothing can be done about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments have repeatedly failed to recognise the cost to Argyll and Bute council of delivering services to the 26 islands. I make no apology for telling the Minister with responsibility for local government again that that places a huge burden on the council and that reductions in services and increases in rents and council tax will go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the most important subject of my speech—the closure of primary schools. I have brought the issue up before, but it is extremely important. Seven primary schools have been closed in the Highland council area and 10 more have been closed in Argyll and Bute—on top of the four that had already been closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
The Secretary of State has gone, but I will remind the Committee of what he said in his document on a development strategy for rural Scotland:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have been elected with a Manifesto commitment to sustain vibrant local communities in rural and remote areas … The Government recognises the importance of high quality primary schools to many rural communities."</p></blockquote>
I am aware of the extra money that has been granted to education. I am sorry that the Minister with responsibility for education has gone, although I am sure that he had to go. However, I reject entirely the claim that the money should be used to rationalise rural primary schools. The Minister said in answer to a question from me during the most recent Scottish Questions that the local authority would maintain that its proposals were education led rather than finance led, but the sole driving force is finance, not education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no unequivocal evidence to support the contention that a small school does not have the spread of expertise to deliver a modern curriculum efficiently. I draw the Committee's attention to the recent report by Her Majesty's inspectorate, "Improving Reading at the Early Stages". It studied 260 primary schools, although it does not name them, so I do not know where they are. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the one in six schools where reading standards were lower, up to half of the children had not attained Level A by the end of Primary 3. In a few schools the proportion not attaining Level A in Primary 3 was more than half."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether any of those 260 schools was in Argyll and Bute or the Highland council area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to give the Minister a typical example of the conclusions that are reached in every report on primary schools—particularly those in Argyll and Bute:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Overall standards of attainment in English language were very good. In listening, talking, reading and writing, almost all pupils had attained the appropriate national targets for their stage. Many had gone well beyond these targets."</p></blockquote>
Those are the schools that the Government are allowing the local authority to close down. The Government will say, "But it's up to the local authority," and of course it is. My local authority was, however, given £440,000 to spend and save. Will the Minister tell me that it is perfectly all right for it to spend and save that money to keep the rural schools open?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers know that closures have a cumulative effect on the rural economy. School closures are often followed by the closure of the post office, the village shop and the petrol station. People leave and no one comes in, particularly no one with a young family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that much of the damage to rural areas was done during the 18 years of the previous Government, particularly through the deregulation of buses. Immense damage was done to post offices. One of my constituents had to drive a 68-mile round journey to get a vehicle licence at the nearest post office. With all the problems in farming and now the possibility of a hike in petrol prices without compensatory measures, things are extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I am sure that rationalisation is necessary in places such as Glasgow, but, as I said, it is not necessary for schools in rural areas; indeed it is wrong. On Saturday I heard one Minister in London saying that the Government would take action on rural schools in England. I have never liked Scottish Ministers slavishly following what Ministers in England are doing—one of the classic examples was the voucher scheme, which Scottish Ministers slavishly followed, although not for the benefit of our children—but I hope that in this case, the responsible Scottish Minister will listen to what the Minister down south said about the need to support rural schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Child care, about which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) spoke earlier, goes hand in hand with education provision, the welfare-to-work programme and the new deal. We need quality and affordable child care. The emphasis must be on quality, so that a mother, in particular, can leave her child with confidence. No mother can be expected to go back to work if she has even the slightest doubt that her child will not be well cared for. Local authorities should take a positive and leading role in coordinating child-care services so that they are accessible and local, particularly in rural areas, so as to avoid the need to travel long distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised by the answer of the devolution Minister—I hate the word "devolution", so I shall call him the home rule Minister—regarding worries about the cost for Edinburgh city council of a building for the new Parliament. Will it incur a cost as a result of the new Parliament's infrastructure and services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Secretary of State has not asked for lottery money to help fund the new Parliament. Some £400 million is being used for that Daddy dome—now baby dome—down south. Surely to goodness we could have got £50 million—a paltry sum—towards the cost of the Parliament building. It will be a democratic building that is supposed to last forever and not for a few days or months, as in the case of the dome. The Secretary of State should apply for lottery funding, or he will be repeatedly subject to carping criticism over the choice of the lowest-cost option. We should be aiming for a worthwhile Parliament despite its cost and one of the ways to fund it is with lottery money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing remains a problem in rural areas where there is a lack of affordable and rented properties. Although councils are no longer major providers, I do not see why they should not be allowed another source of income by increasing council tax on some holiday and second homes. At least that would give them more finance, provided, of course, that there was not a commensurate loss of grant. Scotland is allowed to charge only 50 per cent. of council tax, and Wales up to 75 per cent., but the Secretary of State for Wales recently announced that from 1 April he proposes
	<br><blockquote><p>"to allow local authorities … to charge up to the full council tax … on two types of unoccupied and furnished second homes".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These changes will allow local authorities the discretion … to decide on different treatment for homes".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The 1991 Scotland census showed a total of 11,764 second or holiday homes in the Highlands and Islands enterprise area, which represents 7.2 per cent. of all properties. The Minister responsible for local government will be interested to know that that figure is equivalent to all the housing in the Western Isles. There must be no misunderstanding—I believe that councils should have a discretion; I am not seeking an across-the-board policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should not delude themselves. Few people in the country read the fine print in the Labour manifesto—"Vote Labour for two more years of Tory Government spending plans." The Government should understand that people throughout the country voted for two reasons—they wanted to get rid of a detested and discredited Tory Government and they believed that things would be different if they elected Liberal Democrat, Labour and Scottish National party candidates. There is a great deal of disillusionment, and the Government should take heed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh) said that I had been saying little about the local government settlement. That is not the case. I prefer to discuss issues and I do not indulge in soundbite politics. Perhaps that is why he has not been reading some of my comments in the press. I prefer, as I have been doing, to discuss issues with those involved, such as local councillors and the organisations that are looking to the future of local government under the Scottish Parliament, and to take part in their important and worthwhile debates. That is the role that I have been playing and will continue to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of those in local government—in a former life I had a strong connection to which reference has already been made—I should like to thank the Secretary of State and the Minister for restoring some of our faith in Government. Those in local government have spent years being ignored by the Government of the day, they have been refused access to decision making and, no matter what they said, they were brushed off as though their views were not representative, so it is a breath of fresh air for them to have access to the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office and to be able to discuss the future with them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all appreciate that local government has received better and more courteous treatment from the current Scottish Office than it did from the previous Administration, which could not have treated it any worse.

	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
unnecessary, unwanted and costly reorganisation, which resulted in chaos in many areas—but the very hardworking staff and councillors in local government are making that reorganisation work. The cost of the reorganisation are a direct result of the budgets—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady aware that in the budget settlement that she is defending, there is an assumption of £40 million savings from that chaotic reorganisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Everyone understands the financial situation. This is the beginning of the fight back.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify that point, which came up in debate a couple of weeks ago, we are not assuming those reorganisation savings in future spending plans or in grant allocations.

Local government has an extra £89 million for education and £9 million for nursery education. The actural increase to local authorities is 3.4 per cent. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear that that is just the start; we are still in the first year of a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1996–97, the council tax increase under the Tories was 13 per cent. In 1997–98, it was 10 per cent., and in the next financial year, under a Labour Government, it will be between 6 per cent. and 7 per cent. As was made clear earlier, there is significant flexibility in capping for local authorities. It will be interesting to see if those Scottish Nationalist councils which have been demanding such flexibility in capping will use up all that they are offered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it important for the hon. Lady to recognise that that flexibility involves spending capital as revenue? Therefore, with hard-pressed capital budget spend, and with local communities extremely worried about the state of their schools, it seems improbable that it would be prudent for councils to use up very scarce capital resources to subsidise revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point; it is the choice of the local authorties, They asked for, and were given, that flexibility. That may not be the hon. Gentleman's choice, and it may not be mine, but it is, importantly, the choice of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be looking at the relationship between central and local government. The Government have, quite rightly, set up an independent commission to report to the Scottish Parliament. That was one of the key demands of COSLA and all of local government during the reorganisation process, and it has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
welcomed all round. Everyone recognises that the relationship between local government and a Scottish Parliament must be established. The report will, of course, go to the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in local government are quite happy to consider a different role for local government in the future. We are approaching the next century—why should we offer the sort of local government that was suitable in the early and middle part of this century? We need some innovative and exciting ideas about how to approach local government in the future. I believe that its biggest role is in setting the local agenda and working in partnership with the various organisations within its areas, such as health boards and local enterprise companies. The local authority has the democratic legitimacy to set the agenda in partnership with those organisations and that will be part of the independent commission's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two points for the Scottish Nationalist party and the hon. Member for Angus in particular. How did SNP councils respond to the consultation about public sector pay awards? The decision is not made by Government—it is made by local government, after consulting all councils, including those run by the SNP. Every Scottish council will have responded to the consultation. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned, perhaps he should ask SNP councils about their response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is missing the point. The awards are self financing—they come from the resources of local authorities. That policy was forced on them by the Government. When the hon. Lady was a Labour opposition councillor, she described a Tory Budget as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the politics of the mad house".</p></blockquote>
The Government's settlement is a cut in real terms—how is that not the politics of the mad house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have inherited the politics of the mad house. The Labour government are not one year into power, and yet there have been substantial shifts in the financing of local government and in the relationship between central government and local government. The hon. Gentleman has not answered the question—what were SNP council attitudes to the consultation regarding the public pay award? Perhaps he will give that answer some time in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has seen the sort of opposition that occurs in council chambers throughout Scotland. SNP councillors make off-the-wall suggestions in opposition, but the minute they get into power they learn that they live in the real world, and that they have to take hard decisions based on the promises that they made to their electors. SNP Members are quite different in opposition—not that they will ever be in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to move on and to speak about the future. There is anxiety about local government's share of spending. Central Government provide 86 per cent. of local government funding. Local government is
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
responsible for raising 14 per cent. of its income, but for spending 100 per cent. That removes the democratic link of accountability. All members of the Committee should understand that changing that percentage would mean huge increases in council taxes. Debate about the matter must take place, and the electorate and local government must understand it. The debate will be significant, and it has to happen. Councillors, who are democratically elected, are happy to be accountable to their electorate. They will want to debate the barrier to democratic accountability.

I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister on establishing a far better working relationship with local government and with COSLA to restore the standing of local government after the battering that it took during 18 years of Tory rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can all agree that the present is an important time for local government in Scotland. The first year of the new Labour Government is almost at an end. This week, councils will set their first budgets. A commission has been set up to examine the relationship that local government will have with the new Scottish Parliament. At the weekend, we heard that Strathclyde regional council buildings are to be used—subject to consultation—as the interim site of the Scottish Parliament. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) will understand, there are some symbolic concerns about the possible use of that building, not with the idea that the interim Parliament might not be in Edinburgh—although there would be practical difficulties with that. The hon. Gentleman spent a reasonable amount of time in the borders during the general election campaign and, like me, he dealt with a lot of queries about the Scottish Parliament. One key fear in rural areas, especially the borders, is that it will simply be Strathclyde regional council writ large. We must be careful about the symbolism of using Strathclyde's building in any interim phase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of local government is a key issue just now. What will happen over the next few years? More and more responsibilities are being transferred to local authorities. Recently, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 has restricted what authorities may do. My local authority in the borders is also limited in what it can do about economic development at a time of short-time working and diversification in industries throughout the region. As has been said previously, councillors have only limited ability to decide what their budgets should be, but are held accountable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. Maxton 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>A great deal of anger and frustration is building up because none of those issues has yet been tackled by all the parties. The Government spent years in Opposition attacking such tendencies but we now face
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0943">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
the possibility of real reductions in services, greater privatisation of what remains and huge pressure on the voluntary sector to make up the gap.</p>
	<p>Many of the services financed by local government find it difficult to understand their relationships with other agencies, such as the health boards, and the divide between them causes me great concern. In the Scottish borders, we have a rainbow coalition as every party represented on the Scottish Grand Committee is part of the ruling administration. We are proud of having the lowest council tax in mainland Scotland, but aggrieved that despite that prudent record we are not trusted to to to local council tax payers and say, "You tell us what capping you will accept because you vote us in and out of office."</p>
	<p>My authority is about to set a budget with limited confidence of achieving all that is required. Its social work department is heavily qualifying its budget. It is concerned about the statutory responsibilities of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, which is widely regarded as imaginative and creative, but for which the resources have not followed. Consequently, the department is concerned that in order to do the best that it can with its new responsibilities, it is having to cut existing services to the bone and beyond.</p>
	<p>There are cuts in residential home care and fears that there will be 40 fewer referrals to residential homes during the current year. That means that the bed blocking problems that already exist in local hospitals will get worse. Home care is being reduced to what the Government have described as quasi-nursing care rather than provision of services that people need in their own homes. Under the new budget, assistance with getting up or with having a bath is likely to go. Virtually all that will remain will be the most difficult and personal issues for which people receive home care.</p>
	<p>In my home town—Innerleithen—the day centre is to be reduced to one day opening a week. The council has considered the impact carefully and is doing its best to make sure that none of those who go there for care will be affected. However, the staff will be cut back to just one day a week. It is not only the most vulnerable groups who are hit by this decision, but the next most vulnerable groups. That situation can only get worse if the constraints remain.</p>
	<p>There has been a serious attempt to comply with the Government's wish to put more money into education and I should acknowledge the small amount that they have given. However, the repairs and maintenance budget has been cut by £250,000. Planned investment in computers has also been cut.</p>
	<p>In the border region, it is important for health and leisure facilities to be up to scratch. Instead, mobile libraries are being removed. Across the country, local councils are having to come to terms with severe constraints and extra responsibilities. I must briefly draw attention to the Broomhill day centre, in Penicuik, which is in the Midlothian council region. It is a well-recognised, highly respected organisation that for years has done much work with out-patients, and it has operated on a shoestring. Health boards, which do not fund it, have put pressure on it to take more
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
patients. However, it is already under pressure because it does not pay its staff enough, and more volunteers have to take up the cause. That is surely unacceptable. The Minister will claim that much has changed over the past 12 months; I hope that he will also acknowledge that there is a long way to go.</p>
	<p>12.36 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that for the first time in many years the debate on local government finance and services is taking place under a Government who give the impression of being supportive of local government and its services. Previously, such debates took place under a Government who saw local government as an adversary, an enemy and as something to be destroyed and undermined at every opportunity. The change of climate within which local government operates has been welcomed the length and breadth of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we near the opening of the Scottish Parliament, we must ensure that we resist what may be a natural urge to centralisation, and we must take positive steps to enhance local government's credibility. There is a widespread feeling that this settlement, like many before it, will mean that people will pay more and receive less. That will undermine the credibility of local government and, in the longer term, we must change that pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no enthusiasm among Labour Members for such cuts—most of us came into politics to try to change things for the better, which often requires increased spending. The Government's proposals are infinitely better than they would have been if there had not been a new Tory Government [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I mean, a new Labour Government; I made a mistake. The problem is that we have not achieved as much as people might have expected in the short period that we have been in power. Clarion calls have been made claiming that the settlement proposals involve no differences, but that is not the case in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall grant is inadequate, but I must also criticise the way in which it is being allocated. There is insufficient recognition of poverty and deprivation. The prime determinant of grant in educational terms is the size of child population. Glasgow constitutes 11.7 per cent. of the Scottish population, but 19.2 per cent. of Scotland's youngsters in special schools are in Glasgow, and this costs extra. The grant system does not adequately recognise that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant for services for the handicapped is predominantly determined by population size, which seems to suggest that the disabled are randomly distributed across all sections of the population. The statistics that are available show that that is not the case. About 9.7 per cent. of Glasgow's population receive disabled living allowance and the figure for North Lanarkshire is 9 per cent. The figure for the Scottish borders is 3.26 per cent., which is much lower, and that for Moray is 3.46 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To distribute resources simply on the basis of population does not adequately recognise the differential needs that are often associated with poverty. Poverty means that there are more disabled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
people in the community and that the need for local authority services is greater because the disabled poor do not have the resources to buy the services that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to care of the elderly. Moneys that are distributed predominantly on the basis of population, taking into account the over-85s, do not recognise the scale of deprivation that requires many in Glasgow to use council services. More prosperous people elsewhere could use their own means. Indeed, Glasgow is doubly penalised. Although additional grant is available for the over-85s, the earlier death rates in Glasgow mean that fewer people reach that age and therefore fewer qualify for the additional grant. The city is doubly handicapped. I hope in the 30 seconds or so that remain—the bell is about to toll for me—that the Government will state their willingness to recognise more fully the needs arising from deprivation and poverty when they determine the allocation of grant between authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There also has to be a clear recognition of the metropolitan status of the city of Glasgow. Criteria for the determination of, for example, road maintenance take inadequate account of the enormous number of vehicles that regularly come through the city. But road maintenance has to be paid for by Glasgow's council tax payers, who carry a disproportionate amount of the cost. The poor in the city subsidise the wealthy who commute from outside. That is not a fair or reasonable allocation of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge the Government's priorities and the need for some financial rectitude. I accept that we need some tight limits. It is unrealistic of people to expect us, after 18, 12 or especially six months, to overturn the financial mess that we inherited from the previous Government. But we must make it clear that although this is a tight settlement, things will get better. I stand here as a candidate for jam tomorrow. We must make it clear that there will be jam tomorrow, because local government services will improve. Unlike the previous Government, we believe in local government, and we want to improve services for those whom we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pollok said that there is an impression of a better relationship between central and local government. That is the point. We concede that the record has changed, but the substance is the same as that of the past few years. It would be instructive for members of the Committee, new members in particular, to reflect on a Scottish Grand Committee held in Selkirk just over a year ago. The main debate, which was initiated by the Liberal Democrats, was on last year's local government settlement. There are many similarities with today's discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Demonstrators were outside who were concerned about cuts in schools and in vital, front-line local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be instructive, to look for hon. Members who have undergone a process of alter-ego in the last year. The substance of rhetoric from the Secretary of State is the same as that of the previous Secretary of State. Michael Forsyth said that we should not look at real-terms funding—the settlement in real terms—but at how much he had given us in addition to his previous year's plan. The current Secretary of State has told us that we should look at the original plan to see that he has given us more money than Michael Forsyth proposed. That was the previous Secretary of State's argument in Selkirk last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been juggling figures almost as long as the Secretary of State. There is no way that he can argue that the settlement is anything other than a real-terms cutback in local authority finance. The Secretary of State gave that away himself. When he was asked a specific question, he said that we could work the answer out for ourselves. Had there been an increase in real terms, the Secretary of State would have told us. Given the additional burdens being imposed on them, local authorities face another real decline in finance, in addition to successive declines over the past few years. Local authorities are prisoners; they rely on central Government for 85 per cent. or so of their finance, and central Government place obligations on them to provide 75 per cent. of services. It is absurd not to argue that the question of finance should be part and parcel of the current investigation into local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real test of the settlement for Scotland and Scottish local authorities lies in the evidence presented to the Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh). My hon. Friend referred to local authority after local authority—Glasgow, Edinburgh, North Lanarkshire, Stirling, Clackmannanshire, West Lothian and Dundee—in which unpalatable cuts in local services are proposed. Are we expected to believe that councillors the length and breadth of Scotland would have engaged in a process of cutting vital local services if the financial settlement for local authorities had been satisfactory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a couple of points that the Secretary of State slid over in his opening address. Let us talk about the lack of funding for wage settlements, creating an additional burden of almost £100 million for wage settlements that have not been funded, as they have not been for the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Saturday morning, I met a teacher called Margaret in Argyll street, who was once a strong admirer of the Secretary of State for Scotland and who voted for him at the last general election. She said that she felt victimised. She is a teacher with two children, whom she hopes will go to university. She is also a single parent. She is concerned about the state of the education system and the introduction of student loans and tuition fees, and feels that any pay increase that she receives this year will come out of the fabric of the education system. I can tell the Secretary of State that that lady is no longer an admirer of his politics.

The Secretary of State slid over the estimated £36 million obligation that will result from auditors requiring local authorities to fund their pension schemes, as a result of the Chancellor's introduction of advance corporation tax—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which they denied last summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend says. Presumably, the Secretary of State is not asking local authorities to defy their own auditors. Local authorities will have to find £36 million to fund their pension requirements as a result of Government policy. The Secretary of State told us that we should be grateful for the 0.25 per cent. flexibility, but the point has already been made—I do not know whether the Secretary of State was present at the time—that if that flexibility is used, it will be deducted from the capital allocation, which itself is hard pressed. That is not an opportunity to increase funding; it is an opportunity to transfer marginal funding between the revenue and the capital allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real allegation against the Government—a substantial one, in moral as well as financial terms—is why is money not being made available. Is it because the Treasury is hard pressed for cash, or it it because the Chancellor is building up a war chest with which to fight the next Westminster general election campaign? On 7 December 1997, an article in 	<i>The Observer</i> made the situation clear. It said that estimates of the additional funding to the Treasury, in terms of gains in the public sector borrowing requirement, would amount to £60 billion. That is already coming through in this year's figures. The question for the new Labour Government is why those endowment-effect additonal resources cannot be made available to defend frontline services today. What sort of morality says, "We will cut Scottish services today so that we can try to win a Westminster election tomorrow"? The war chest argument should be addressed by the Minister with responsibility for local Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two final points. The first relates to the Secretary of State's different attitudes towards democratic local government and the water quangos. Democratic local government, represented by COSLA, argued that services are in decline and the capital infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. The Secretary of State's response was a real terms decrease in their budget this year. Scottish water quangos argued that their capital budget needs repair, and the Secretary of State's response was to allow the full 17.5 per cent. increase in water rates that they asked for. Why does the Secretary of State accept what water quangos say but not the word of democratic councillors throughout the length and breadth of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is stupid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us, then, examine the differing treatment of debt write-off. For years we were told by the Secretary of State's predecessor and, presumably, by him that capital debt for Scottish local authorities, particularly in the housing budget, cannot be written
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
off. Yet the water quangos have had elements of their capital debt written off in Scotland, although admittedly they were not allowed to write off 100 per cent. of the capital debt as the privatised water companies were allowed to do south of the border. What is the reason for the differing treatment of water quangos and democratic local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State told us that we must consider a variety of ways of service provision and that the modern way is to examine availability of private capital to fund services in Scotland. I wonder whether the Secretary of State supports the proposals by Falkirk council that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the taxpayer will be expected to fork out an additional £60 million in order to pay for the scheme through the private finance initiative rather than through Government borrowing. Over the 25-year life of the school, it is expected that the community will have to stump up an additional £110 million and at the end of this period the council will not own a single brick. At the end of the 25-year period, the company will still own the lease on the ground and will therefore be in a strong negotiating position with the council that will have to renew the lease on the buildings. By this stage the developer and ownership of the contract may be a different company and have very little interest in Scottish education apart from potential profit—private profit—for that company."</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State's interpretation of investigating different ways of financing services means privatising not just the buildings—in another private finance initiative project the staff have come under the control of a private company—many of us prefer the traditional way of funding public services through public finance.

Last year at Celtic—[	<i>Interruption</i>]—I am taking the advice of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) who knows that the present league position is very satisfactory to him and quite satisfactory to me. Last year at Selkirk, I should say, the then Secretary of State argued that the settlement was good for local authorities and that the Opposition where whining when they complained about the lack of service provision. The same argument has been made by the present Secretary of State, which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Angus was correct to say, "Oh sorry, new Labour, no difference."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh) raised his hands in horror at the thought of local authorities becoming enabling authorities, and he apparently found the language repugnant. But many authorities are already enablers, and central Government often are. For example, central Government hands hundreds of millions of pounds a year to voluntary organisations and some hon. Members want us to give more money to voluntary organisations. When people refer to enabling authorities and ways of delivering services, that does not have to mean privatisation or the profit motive. It can mean working together with the voluntary sector and the social sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with enabling authorities, in the sense of local government working with all sorts of voluntary organisations, but there is a difference between enabling authorites and service-providing authorities. The Tory argument was that we should move away from service provision towards purely enabling authorities, which has been adopted as a policy by new Labour. I would like to know how far down that road the Minister wishes to go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These voluntary organisations already provide services, and local authorities have decided that the best way of providing those services is by supporting those organisations. Central government do likewise. The key question is not who provides the services; the key questions are whether they are being provided to a high standard and whether they are providing value for money. Local authorities will focus on those questions increasingly in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn to the matter that has preoccupied most of the debate—the financial partition for local authorities. We have said all along that it is a tight and difficult settlement; we have made no bones whatsoever about that. We have not tried to cast the blame on local authorities for the difficult decisions that they have to make. We have to make such difficult decisions ourselves. Local government spending will increase next year, over and above what is spent in the current year. A 3.4 per cent. increase, which is a cash increase of £190 million, will take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a real increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a cash increase. The hon. Gentleman can make his own estimates about inflation, but that is a 3.4 per cent. increase in cash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the cash terms increase is 3.4 per cent., and inflation is running at something in excess of that at present, what is the position in real terms? I am sure that the Minister can do the calculations as well as I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The SNP has suggested that an extra £150 million would be required to avoid cuts. We are already spending an extra £190 million next year, and if the extra £150 million is added in, the SNP is suggesting that something like a 6 per cent. increase is required just to stand still. That is simply not credible. We have said that the financial settlement is difficult, but more money will be provided for local authorities next year, in terms of their current spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made it clear at the time of the general election that for the first two years we would largely stick to the financial plans that we inherited. We have largely stuck to those plans, but not entirely; we have provided more money. Over and above the money we provided for local authorities, we provided money for the new deal, which is an extra £270 million altogether for spending next year on vital and important services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members raised the issue of whether finance would be included in the remit of the independent commission. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland answered that point, saying that
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
finance was being considered as part of the comprehensive spending review. Hon. Members who think that simply providing more financial flexibility for local authorities is a cure-all should be warned that that is not so. If less funding is coming from central government, local government will have to provide more of its own funding. That allows more flexibility, but it also means that those local authorities with a stronger tax base will have a great advantage over those local authorities with a weaker one. That must be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says about flexibility and capping.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering the issue as part of the comprehensive spending review.

	<div class='title'>Highlands and Islands (EU Structural Funds)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</p>
	<p>1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Stewart: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to make the case for continued funding from Europe for the highlands and islands after 1999. However, I am not blind to the social and economic needs of the rest of Scotland—the great difficulties of some of our cities for example, and the economic handicap of other rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need an overall, comprehensive Scottish strategy for European funding after 1999. We should push for renewed objective 1 status for the highlands and islands, and objective 2 status for the rest of Scotland requiring the funding. I invite the Minister to come to my constituency to speak to the Highland and Islands European Partnership to discuss future funding for the highlands and islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is opportune that we are discussing the objective 1 funding today. I understand that the Commission is putting together the final draft regulations over the next few days. Therefore, we are essentially putting flesh on the bones of Agenda 2000, the policy document that analyses European funding after the enlargment of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to most hon. Members that objective 1 will change. In future, I believe that there will be only three eligible categories, rather than the previous seven. That should be seen as an opportunity, and not merely as a threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to examine why the highlands and islands constitute a special case, what the impact of structural funds has been in the past, what is expected of the highlands and islands, what opportunities structural funds bring and what the next step in the strategy should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members know that the highlands and islands are unique, and are perhaps the last unspoilt area of Europe. I speak as a highlander. There are real problems of sparsity and of low incomes. The area is peripheral to the rest of Europe. It has high transport costs and unemployment and underemployment problems—in an area larger than Belgium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
The impact of past structural funds on the highlands and islands can be traced back to 1970, when the area had the old 5b funding status under objective 1 and had about £240 million pumped into the highlands economy. Some examples of projects planned for the future are the funicular railway, which will be a tremendous boost to that area; the Mallaig Harbour development; and the dry dock at Barmac oil fabrication yard, which will allow the oil fabrication industry in my area to compete in Europe in the manufacture of floating production vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Euro-speak, for which I apologise, the two main goals are, first, external cohesion—examining the highlands and islands' economic health, compared with the EU average—and, secondly, internal cohesion—reducing disparity within the highlands and islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objective 1 funding has been a powerful catalyst to stimulate additional investment in the highlands and islands. It has also been a great success. Hon. Members should not take my word only for that. Independent appraisals of the projects on which objective 1 money has been spent have been undertaken. Those appraisals have found that 92 per cent. of the projects have high or medium effectiveness. The gross number of jobs gained over the period of objective 1 funding has been about 1,800. The funding is tremendously important to a still fragile economic area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the key feature of the new structural funds regime should be a focus on rural areas and on GDP per head, and that we should not get caught up in a Commission definition that focuses purely on unemployment and would be unfavourable to all of us in Scotland, not just the highlands and islands. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that with a bigger pot of money available, we should resist the Commission's proposals to focus it on a narrower segment of the European population?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to focus on rural areas. If we could get the highlands and islands to continue under objective 1, there would be fewer demands on the objective 2 budget. If the highlands and islands received objective 2 funding, they would be in competition with, for example, Dumfries and Galloway and the borders. The best way to maximise resources is to go for objective 1. I also agree that there is still a debate to be had about the criterion of 75 per cent. of GDP. Some economists argue that employment levels have to be viewed in different ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are threats to the highlands and islands. I shall mention a few of them, although the list is not exclusive. With regard to costs, there is great concern about, for example, food prices, which are 8 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
higher than in Aberdeen. In the remote islands, they are 22 per cent. higher—the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) would know more than me about the cost of food in those areas. There are also problems with petrol and transport costs, which are 17 to 20 per cent. higher than in urban areas. That, of course, reflects limited competition, a lack of economies of scale and higher transport costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment or under-employment is also a great problem. In earlier debates we heard about seasonality, particularly in tourism. There are difficulties, with part-time and contract work—56 per cent. of the unemployed in the Western Isles are longterm unemployed. The are also issues relating to low income. The new earnings survey shows that wages are 14 per cent. below the Scottish average and 23 per cent. below the United Kingdom average. A higher cost of living combined with low incomes form a double whammy. That is a recipe for poverty, poor housing and depopulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are six key opportunites for the highlands and islands. First, there is its first-class environment—the region contains two thirds of the Scottish sites of special scientific interests. I concede that there are some problems with designation, but the statistic indicates how well respected is the area's environment. One fifth of the region is classed as a national scenic area. That high-quality environment is a great selling point and key factor in the promotion of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New technology is a second opportunity and a tremendous weapon for defeating the problems of distance and peripherality. We have video links, multimedia and the super-highway. The development of the university of the highlands and islands, which I and many honourable Members have supported for many years, has been a key initiative. Its exciting educational programme for the new millennium will open up education opportunities in the highlands and islands. There are also openings in what is called tele-medicine. I recently visited the Highlands health board in Inverness, where I watched a role play of an interview between a doctor in Skye and a patient in Inverness. The wonders of new technology make that possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the honourable Gentleman for giving way, because this is a short debate. Does he recall that Highlands and Islands Enterprise said that additional pressure was needed to ensure that land lines were laid to develop vital hi-tech industry? Will he join us in ensuring that the Scottish Office back our efforts in that area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support the honourable Lady on that. New technology is a powerful weapon. We must use it to increase access to the job market, especially for women returners and those with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Thirdly, we have tremendous opportunities in our resource base—forestry, fresh water and hydroelectricity. For example, the world centre for wave development and wave power is in Inverness, in my constituency. We have the opportunities—we just need the economic wherewithal to exploit them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, there is tourism, which is vital for my constituency and for the highlands and islands in general. It earns £500 million and 12 per cent. of our employment relates to it. I have already mentioned the funicular. We need to find a way of extending the tourist season and ensuring that the quality of the tourism product gets better and better. The range of experiences for tourists must increase. We already have the Mallaig underwater centre and the Inverness aquadome, but we cannot stop there. We must continue to develop the facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, there is cultural diversity, by which I mean the development of Gaelic. I am conscious of the fact that many members of the Committee have a better knowledge of the language than I do. There has been a temporary decline in its use and there are now about 80,000 speakers in Scotland. There is, however, a great possibility of revival—particularly through our development agencies and educational institutes. It has been estimated that more than 1,000 jobs in Scotland depend on Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, there are high educational standards. Pupils from the highlands and islands are more likely to pursue university education than the average pupil in Scotland. On average, 27 per cent. of pupils in Scotland pursue university education; in the Western Isles—I say this because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), will reply to the debate—the average is 38 per cent; the highland average is 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The highlands and islands have benefited immensely from previous European assistance programmes. Spending has been effective and efficient and has made significant inroads into economic and social development. The region has the wherewithal to respond to the key changes in the European Union post-Agenda 2000. Although the GDP per capita of the highlands and islands is well below the European Union average, it does not fully reflect the impact of their remoteness and peripherality. The key objective is to ensure that we permanently end the cycle of decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for continuing objective 1 funding for the highlands and islands remains strong on economic and sparsity grounds. Structural funds are a hand-up, not a hand-out. They are there to promote economic and social cohesion, which is an essential element of European Union philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1964, the Labour Government created the Highlands and Islands development board in a bid to fight the depopulation and decline of the highlands
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
and islands. In 1998, the Labour Government have an opportunity to argue a powerful case in Europe for stimulating the economic, technological and human potential of the highlands and islands. In that way, we could have an achievement on a par with the development and creation of the Highlands and Islands development board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) for his informed address on this complex and often misunderstood topic—he obviously understands the issues. He will be aware that I share his interest in the future of the funds, both as a Minister and, as he mentioned, because of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that reform of the structural funds has come about partly because the current financial framework expires at the end of 1999 and partly because any future funding must take into account enlargement of the European Union. The reform process started with the publication of the Commission's broad proposals for reform in July 1997. We still await the detail of those proposals, but we expect them to be published later this month.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed the Minister's opening remarks. While he is talking about finances, does he acknowledge that money is set aside for enlargement and for the countries that might come in as a result of it? What is left is 15 per cent. higher in real terms, and on an annual basis, than the existing programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I completely understand the hon. Gentleman. My understanding is that we are trying to keep structural funding below 0.46 per cent. of Community gross national product and that we must stick to that. Bearing that in mind, we must acknowledge that the enlargement process will inevitably have an impact on those regions that will be eligible for structural funding in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, we have had general indications from the Commission about the balance that it wants. We will have to wait until later this month for its detailed proposals. Thereafter, there will be a process of debate among member states, and the final decisions will be taken by the Council of Ministers, not the Commission. Although doubts are being expressed about the timetable, there is still hope that negotiations will be completed and that the new regulations will be in place by the middle of next year. However, the discussions still have a long way to go and the debate is just starting. The final result could be very different from the suggestions that the Commission made last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
So far, the Commission has proposed maintaining the existing budget limits during the next programme period. At the same time it also proposes to reduce the population covered by the funds. The Government, as a net contributor, welcome that step, but it must be fair to all member states, including those that are entering and those that are already in receipt of those funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission also proposes to reduce the seven objectives to three. That is also welcome because it will simplify and reduce the burden on those involved in delivering the funds. It is proposed that the new objective 1 adheres strictly to the criterion of per capita GDP of 75 per cent. or less of EU average. The new objective 2 would be formed by merging the current objectives 2 and 5b and would address urban areas in difficulty, rural areas in decline and changes in industrial and fisheries sectors. The proposed objective 3 would concentrate on human resource development and training to combat unemployment. Importantly, the Commission proposes transitional arrangements to compensate areas that will no longer be eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals aim to simplify the overall funding process. The Commission has set itself the target of ensuring that the funds are used more effectively. We in the Scottish Office are discussing with officials from the Commission novel ways of delivering the funds to achieve those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As President of the European Union, the Government have the task of making progress in obtaining agreement in negotiations across all member states, rather than concentrating solely on the UK position. We hope to use the informal meeting on regional policy in Glasgow in June to progress the Commission's proposals and to reach firmer conclusions on the principles of the new funds. Although the negotiations will not be concluded during the UK six-months presidency, we hope to make significant progress. It is essential that we make good progress before the end of June to avoid the dislocation experienced in the past when one programme has ended and another has begun. When the new rules are not clear to everybody, there is a great deal of confusion, and those whose job it is to deliver the funds experience difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come now to our objectives as a member state. The Government's top priority is a successful enlargement of the European Union, for which there must be agreement on a budget that is affordable and spending plans that are fair and durable within that budget. That necessitates a reform of the current funding structure, but that reform must be fair and equal to all states. Acceding nations must receive a funding package that is acceptable to the established member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we recognise the depth of economic need of the acceding states and the UK must be prepared to accept a lower level of receipts as a consequence. I am sure that we all agree that a poorer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0950">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
member state should receive more, per capita, from the fund than a richer one. That has not always happened, and for future funding to be fair and durable and for enlargement to succeed, that principle must be established. The main question is fairness and that is the principle on which we are focusing in our current discussions with other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the highlands and islands, the fund is worth about £225 million, of which almost £200 million has already been allocated to projects. We are well on track for allocating the remainder, and the money has been well used by the partners in the highlands and islands. It looked as though strict adherence to the objective 1 criterion would lead to the highlands and islands no longer being eligible for the fund, but we are examining all options. As my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber said, the problems of population sparsity and geography in the highlands and islands are similar to those in objective 6 areas and the Commission's proposals include provision for such areas to be treated as objective 6 areas under objective 1. We shall be pursuing that approach. If population sparsity is to be included, it should apply to areas such as the highlands and islands as well as to countries which have had it before such as Sweden and Finland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working together with Nordic countries on this issue is not new to Scotland; we have been doing it for some time to enhance our links with the Nordic countries. We will continue to press this point in negotiations with the Commission. The Minster of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office—my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson)—has already raised this with the Commission. It has been raised at a European as well as a Scottish Office level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we approach the lengthy period of negotiations, I am optimistic that Scotland is in a strong position. Our programmes are performing well in terms of commitment and spend, and our partnership arrangements for delivery of the funds are frequently held up by the Commission as examples of good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office is also working closely with COSLA, the enterprise network and other partners to develop a unified approach to the reform debate. A working group of officials of all the major bodies has already been an invaluable forum for detailed discussions and will continue to meet regularly in the coming months. It is important, as we get nearer and receive more details from the Commission, that we consult even more widely than we have done so far. I will make a commitment to that kind of discussion. I have already held some discussions and will continue to do so. I will happily accept invitations extended by my hon. Friend to come to Inverness, which is
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
probably the most logical place to discuss the future of the funds with those partners and bodies which have a direct interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is a great deal of concern at the implications of reform for Scotland. My hon. Friend has expressed particular concern about the highlands and islands. We cannot give a categorical assurence at this stage, but I can give an assurance that Ministers and officials will be working very hard to achieve the best possible outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
