	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. In the highly unlikely event that there is spare time left after you have called every hon. Member who wishes to question our remarkable Secretary of State, would you allow an hon. Member to ask a second question? I do not anticipate being called to do so but, if sufficient time is left out of our allotted 90 minutes, can a member of the Committee ask a supplementary question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The statement and questions last for an hour and a half. The order allows us to continue our discussions until 6 o'clock and, if there is time for people to ask a second question, I shall allow that to happen—that is, if they catch my eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I call the Secretary of State to make his statement on the Scottish local government settlement and the redistribution of resources for 1998–99, I appeal to members of the Committee, including the spokesmen for Opposition parties, to keep their questions brief. I also ask the Secretary of State to make his answers brief. As a result of that, each member of the Committee should have time to ask at least one question, and it may be possible to call some right hon. and hon. Members to ask a second question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Maxton, for my marginally late appearance in Committee. If you had seen me making my best pace along the Committee Corridor, the amusement would have outweighed any inconvenience that I was causing to the Committee. However, Mr. Maxton, you were imprisoned in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a statement about public expenditure in Scotland and the financial settlement for local authorities in Scotland, which I am proposing for the financial year 1998–99. A table summarising my decision together with details of the local government settlement is on the Table and that material will appear in a written answer in the 	<i>Official Report</i> for today. Further copies will be available in the Vote Office, as will copies of my statement. Full details of today's announcement will be published in the spring in my departmental report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I genuinely take to heart, Mr. Maxton, your point about brevity. I must therefore apologise for the length of my statement, but it deals with two major areas of Government policy and contains much information that, I hope, will assist colleagues—although they might want to digest it over the next day or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In allocating Scottish expenditure between programmes for the coming year, I have been guided by several important considerations. First, I have been concerned with pressing ahead in Scotland with the Government's main priorities: improving standards in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
education and health; preparing for devolution; supporting welfare to work; tackling Scotland's housing challenges and consolidating measures on criminal justice. Much work needs to be done under each of those headings and today's announcement marks further progress, with additional resources to support those priority areas throughout 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I have needed to take account of the Government's comprehensive spending review. We initiated the review shortly after coming to office, and it involves a root-and-branch examination of all Government spending. In Scotland, work is already well under way scrutinising the major programmes for which I have responsibility. Fundamental questions are being asked about whether resources are being used on the right priorities; whether the money is being used efficiently and effectively; and whether there are ways of making the available resources work harder—for example, through partnerships between the public and private sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect the review to be completed in the spring of 1998. Its conclusions will be fed directly into the resource allocation decisions made for 1999–2000. I am determined that the Government should provide the new Scottish Parliament with real choices in its first six months, and that it should be fully involved during the vesting period in considering the outcome of the comprehensive spending review and the implications for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's announcement does not pre-empt that review, but after 18 years of decisions on Scottish spending being vested in politicians who did not share the people's priorities for Scotland, it represents a real change in direction. Today's announcement lays the foundations for the more fundamental changes that I expect to emerge from the comprehensive spending review and from the transfer of financial responsibility to the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I have to consider the wider economic considerations and the Government's policy of maintaining a tight control over public expenditure. The Government are committed to the sound management of public finances and to the avoidance of the boom-and-bust cycle that has been so damaging to the country's economic interests. All Government Departments, including the Scottish Office, have been asked to allocate public expenditure for the coming year within existing spending plans. However, key additional resources were provided in the Budget and thereafter; I shall, of course, return to this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's general fiscal discipline must apply in Scotland. Our long-term economic prosperity is inextricably linked to the performance of the United Kingdom's economy. It is misguided and unrealistic to suggest that the solution to Scotland's problems lies in an ever rising curve of public spending. Good government lies in carefully identifying the country's needs and priorities and then maximising the output from the available resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fulfilling our manifesto commitments and laying a proper foundation for the future were the watchwords for today's settlement. It is on those firm foundations that the comprehensive spending review—and ultimately the Scottish Parliament—will build. We are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
confident that today's settlement means Scotland getting more for its money—less waste, better priorities and new foundations for growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial year 1998–1999 has to be regarded as transitional. Additional resources were made available in the Budget in June, but today's announcement goes further. It builds on that foundation to tailor Scottish spending more closely to Scotland's needs by exploiting my ability to move resources around within the Scottish block.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the more concrete elements of my statement. I shall distribute an extra £270 million on top of the spending plans that we inherited from the previous Government for 1998–99. Those resources represent Scotland's share of budget and subsequent initiatives aimed at meeting the Government's key priorities. That money serves significantly to reverse the fall in block spending built into the previous Government's plans. I also propose to re-allocate a further £100 million within my block resources to support the Government's key priorities for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key message is that the Scottish Office is building for the future with a three-point package for investment in education. Education, education and education is what we promised, and the package that I announce today represents a major step in our delivery on that pledge, with a crucial boost for the pre-five-year-olds, investment in schools, and new investment in further and higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health will get a boost in advance of the publication next week of the White Paper on the national health service in Scotland, which will propose to sweep away the wasteful bureaucracy of the internal market and redirect resources into putting patients first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing, which was too long neglected by the previous Government, will have more than £50 million extra to take the homeless off the streets, bring empty homes back into use, improve energy efficiency and support new public-private sector partnerships to lever extra resources into housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the details. I do not need to stress that good education opens up opportunities in life and that an early start is needed. We have already announced that pre-school vouchers will be replaced from August 1998 with a new funding and planning system. The Government guarantee a nursery place for all four-year olds in Scotland whose parents want one by the winter of next year. That means a major expansion of services. An extra £9 million will be made available to local authorities to deliver that, bringing our overall commitment to the scheme to £76 million next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investing in good teaching to raise standards in our schools is vital if Scotland's children are to fulfil their potential and progress to further and higher education. Resources in the classroom are our overriding priority. We are making an additional £89 million over and above the former Government's planned total available to authorities to spend in schools next year—as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget. Much of that money will go into improving standards in our classrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already in Glasgow we are seeing a commitment to rationalise schools. The priority across the country must be to move cash back to where it is needed, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
supporting good teaching, not heating half-empty buildings. Where schools buildings are to be used they must be of a high standard. Hence we have promised both to tackle the backlog of repairs to school buildings and to improve facilities for information technology. Additional capital resources of £8.9 million for this year and £26.7 million for the next four years were announced in the summer Budget, and all education authorities will benefit from that. Those resources will also help the development of a national grid for learning throughout the United Kingdom, which will build on the distance learning initiatives already under way in many parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Making education an overriding priority means seeking out new ways to finance what needs to be done. For example, Falkirk council is promoting one of the most innovative private finance initiative projects in schools across Britain, with a capital cost of about £70 million affecting five secondary schools. I am sure that that initiative will encourage a number of other authorities in Scotland which are also developing imaginative PFI schemes to improve their schools and provide information technology. We are determined to put the framework in place to ensure that schools throughout Scotland are upgraded and modernised so that they are capable of delivering the highest standards that we expect of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have recognised that learning does not stop when a child leaves the classroom. Children are our future and we have a duty to ensure that they have a safe and challenging environment. Outside the school day, children must have an environment in which they can build on what they have learnt during the day through activities that will help take forward our commitment to raise standards and encourage personal development. We also need to ensure that parents, especially women, have opportunities open to them to balance work and family life. That is why we announced last week an additional £28 million over the next five years, drawing on the new opportunities fund, to extend affordable after-school child care in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last summer, we had to take important decisions about the future funding of higher education following the Dearing and Garrick reports. The central challenge to which those reports drew attention was the need to get more resources into higher education if our students were to benefit from high-quality facilities and if our national research base was not to be fatally eroded. Hard decisions—I do not disguise that—have been taken because we believe them to be right to secure the future of our universities and colleges. The need to get more resources into higher education was even more pressing in Scotland, where we send a higher proportion of students into further and higher education and where the skill of our work force is increasingly Scotland's key selling point in the global market place. I am pleased, therefore, to announce that next year the resources available to the higher education sector will rise by £17 million from a planned £653 million to £670 million—the same in cash terms as this year. The resources available to the further education sector will rise by £8 million. Some £22 million of that additional £25 million is a result of the tough decisions which we have taken on student finance. It will provide significant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and welcome relief from the position that we inherited and the tight squeeze that the sectors have been facing in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education also has a major part to play in tackling skill shortages in Scotland and in widening access to lifelong learning. The colleges will, therefore, also benefit from a share of the funds available to support the education and training option of our welfare to work agenda. Those additional funds should enable the further education sector to play a full role in delivering key Government initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The educational investments to which I have referred are about laying the foundations for Scotland's future prosperity. Those principles have also determined the change that I have made to the industry budget. The previous Government asserted that they also supported enterprise and inward investment, yet we inherited plans showing a planned decrease in the Scottish Enterprise gross budget of £26 million between 1997–98 and 1998–99. Despite that inheritance I am pleased to say that we will increase the gross budget, which represents the real spending power of Scottish Enterprise, by £14 million above the proposed plans, to bring it up to £454 million. I will, however, be looking to the network to make hard choices and to set out a realistic range of priorities for future years to reflect our objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland has, of course, been very successful in attracting inward investment, and I pay tribute to the excellent work of Locate in Scotland and the rest of the enterprise network in that achievement. I am confident that the attraction of Scotland as a location for both inward investors and indigenous firms will ensure that companies will continue to establish themselves in Scotland and to prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training activities of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise will continue to receive substantial support, and that will be boosted next year by the new deal to get young people and the long-term unemployed off welfare and into work. That programme should pump up to £300 million into Scotland's efforts in that field over the next five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also propose to restore the £1 million cut in the Scottish tourist board budget planned by the previous Administration. Tourism is a vital sector of the Scottish economy—especially for rural areas—and I will be looking to the Scottish tourist board to make effective use of those additional resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to health. I am making significant additional resources available to improve standards of health care. In the Budget, we made it clear that we were going to increase funding for the national health service in Scotland by more than £106.6 million in 1998–99. Taken with the increase already built into the plans, that will mean that the health service in Scotland will receive almost £205 million more than the planned expenditure for this year. That represents an increase of 4.7 per cent., which will mean that we can carry on with the improvements that we have already started this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say a word about what we have already achieved in the past eight months in health. One of our first actions when we came to Government was to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
instruct health boards to find £5 million in efficiency savings to tackle waiting lists. They found £7 million—I give them credit for that. At the same time, boards were charged with ploughing another £5 million worth of savings into planning for the inevitable winter pressures that hospitals begin to face at this time of year. Last month, we made £27 million available this year to help the NHS to cope with the expected increase in demand for emergency admissions to Scottish hospitals, to reduce waiting times, to enable more rehabilitation wards to be opened and to provide for new community-based facilities for the Borders. The additional resources for next year will enable those improvements to continue and, I hope, expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, improving the health service is not simply a matter of money. We must ensure that resources are used effectively. The forthcoming White Paper on the NHS in Scotland will outline our proposals for how the health service should develop. I firmly believe that it will lay the foundations for a modern health service for the new millennium—one that is more patient-friendly and efficient and free at the point of need for all who require its services. The measures that the White Paper will outline to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Scottish health service will ensure that it is second to none in its quality of patient care. It will reiterate the Government's manifesto pledge to provide real terms cash increases for the NHS—a commitment that I hope a future Scottish Parliament will also feel bound to honour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland's housing was shamefully neglected under the previous Government. Our commitment to live within published plans means that everything cannot be done at once. We have also had to find £30 million to meet the extra costs associated with the repayment of Scottish Homes' debt, in line with obligations entered into by our predecessors. However, we have made a vital start with four important initiatives to tackle major challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rough sleepers initiative, designed to take the homeless off the street, will now have a total budget of £5 million next year. The initiative will be backed by our new code of guidance on homelessness, which came into force on Monday. The empty homes initiative will receive an extra £7 million to assist local authorities to develop a wide range of innovative projects to bring empty houses back into use. Home energy efficiency measures will be boosted by £5 million, with resources to be linked to new deal projects to get young people back into work. The new housing partnerships initiative will receive £35 million in addition to the planned figure for next year, to develop partnership projects with the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the aspects of this year's settlement that gives me the most pleasure is the need to start making provision for devolution. That represents a departure—for me, a very welcome departure—from previous public expenditure statements. An enormous amount of work is already under way to prepare for the Scottish Parliament, but next year will see a step change in the level of activity. I am therefore making available £15 million specifically for devolution-related expenditure, most of which will be required to take forward the new Parliament building project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
As we all know, it is never easy to find money for new and innovative programmes, but I have no difficulty in justifying my decision in this case. Those resources are an investment in decision-making by Scots in Scotland. I am not known for my profligacy, and I assure the Committee and Scotland that we can combine the need for fiscal prudence with an efficient and effective building—a fit home for a powerful and accountable Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the field of criminal justice, one of my particular concerns has been to relieve the pressure on the prisons system and to develop effective alternatives to custody. Community-based sentences ensure that offenders give something back to the community. All courts should have access to a full range of effective non-custodial disposals which will bring home to offenders the consequences of their behaviour and encourage a law-abiding lifestyle. To allow for the expansion and development of community-based disposals, I am making a further £2.5 million a year available. That will bring our annual commitment up to about £37 million and will. for example, allow for the pilot project for restriction of liberty orders with electronic tagging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In determining expenditure for transport, we have begun the process of shifting resources from a narrow focus on ever more roads to a more comprehensive transport strategy. The roads review is now under way. Existing road construction projects as announced in June, will of course proceed as planned, including the schemes on the A75 and the A828. We are committed to the proper maintenance of the trunk road network and we plan to spend more than £95 million on that next year. Additional resources have been made available to a variety of road safety programmes, including those aimed specifically at reducing the number of child casualties on our roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with our policy of encouraging traffic off the roads, I propose to increase assistance for measures aimed at transferring freight traffic from road to rail. Another £4.1 million will be made available to the freight facilities grant programme to encourage greater use of rail freight services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another priority has been to improve lifeline services to outlying island communities. In particular, the ferry services to the northern and western isles will receive an additional £10.5 million next year. I also propose to provide an additional £3 million to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd. to help the company's capital investment programme in Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pausing for breath, I come to the local government settlement. I am sure that the Committee will have taken down all the details already and so I will push on. Those, then, are the main features of the distribution of Scottish block resources for 1998–99. As the Committee knows, a large proportion of that block—more than 40 per cent.—is used to support local government spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon, I announced in a parliamentary answer aggregate figures for the local government finance settlement for next year. In the past seven months my hon. Friend the Member for Leith (Mr. Chisholm) and I have had many meetings with local authorities and visited many councils across Scotland. We have seen at first hand the pressures on local
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
government and the good work that is being done. We have also had some very constructive discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about the financial settlement for next year, and I pay sincere tribute to the way in which the COSLA leadership and membership have faced up to some very difficult issues. It is absolutely clear that the emphasis that my colleagues in local government and I place on the development of best value is vital. We are determined to ensure that the substantial resources that we devote to council services are used to the best possible effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plans that we inherited from the previous Administration left us with some very real difficulties. In cash terms, grant to Scottish councils was set to fall by more than 1 per cent. and expenditure to rise by only 0.7 per cent., even after making provision for new burdens such as community care. Despite that severe squeeze, the plans that we inherited still implied an average council tax rise of around 7 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been able to make significant improvements to those plans to reflect particularly our priority for education. First, I have announced my provisional capping principles, which will set and decide local authority spending power, allowing for an increase in capped spending of £191 million on this year's level—an increase of 3.4 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that, local authorities will receive a further £75 million of direct Government support to fund preschool education next year. That, too, is an increase over the plans inherited from the previous Administration, reflecting the importance that we attach to nursery education and delivering our pledge on preschool education—a place for every child in the preschool year whose parents want it. Including the additional funding for nursery education, the total expenditure on services by Scottish local authorities will be 3.6 per cent. higher next year than it was this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as that increase in spending power, there is an increase in Government funding, mostly for education. Scottish local authorities will receive £5.3 billion in Government support through aggregate external finance in the coming year. Overall, I do not expect the average council tax rise in Scotland to be significantly different from the rise implied by the inherited plans—around 7 per cent.—despite the improvements in spending on services that our settlement allows. The rise in each area will, of course, depend on local circumstances and on decisions taken by individual councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already made it clear—I make no apology for it, nor do I seek to hide it—that this will be a tight settlement for local government. Within the total increases available, authorities will have to focus resources on our agreed priorities and cope with some inescapable pressures, such as the increase in the cost of their pension contributions from the abolition of advance corporation tax. The capping provision I have announced will give them some headroom to do that. Authorities will therefore be faced with some difficult choices; I make no secret of that. It may be no consolation, but those are exactly the choices I myself have had to face in other parts of my budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I now turn to my priorities for services within the local government block, as expressed in the service split of grant-aided expenditure. Those priorities have been discussed with COSLA, and represent our shared assessment of the priority areas for spending increases. I have allocated an additional £108 million to education, which adds nearly £20 million to the extra resources already announced in the Budget. I have increased the social work GAE by £40 million—£15 million on top of the £25 million additional resources already earmarked for community care this year. That recognises a number of pressures on the social work budget, such as the provisions of the Children Act 1989. GAE for the police has been set at £691 million, an increase of £16 million over this year. That represents the levels of spending for police forces which can be afforded and which I think appropriate for authorities to spend. I have also given favourable treatment to the fire services, with an increase of £6 million to GAE of £170 million. The details of the split across all services are given in the circular to local authorities which my Department is issuing today and of which a copy is on the Committee Room Table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two other aspects of the settlement to which I draw attention. First, a number of significant technical changes are working their way through the grant distribution arrangements and it is unacceptable that fluctuations in the way in which we distribute the grant should cause big increases or decreases in council tax levels which are wholly unrelated to the spending decisions of the councils themselves. I have had careful discussions with COSLA about a grant safety net to reduce those fluctuations, and again it has risen to the challenge and shown an ability to deal with such questions in a mature and constructive way. Therefore, in this year's grant distribution, I will ensure that major changes in the GAE assessments for different councils are phased in gradually and that there will be a council tax safety net in the system, which will restrict the effect of grant distribution changes on council tax levels. That safety net will not, however, affect councils' spending power. I have also ensured in the capping criteria that I announced capping flexibility for those lower spending councils which will not gain as much grant as they had hoped because of the grant stability arrangements. Indeed, I have been able to set capping principles that show greater flexibility and which are in all respects more generous than the criteria set by my predecessor. No council, overall, is likely to have a budget rise of less than about 2.3 per cent. with some markedly larger increases. In addition, I propose to make available to authorities the option that they enjoyed last year, of "spend to save", under which they have the flexibility to use part of their capital allocations as revenue expenditure to realise savings in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taken together, that represents a demanding but fair local government settlement. It gives authorities scope to increase their spending to focus on our agreed priorities, particularly education, and to cope with some of the unavoidable pressures on them. I also place great emphasis on making progress with the best value agenda. The Government are determined to ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
we get the most efficient and effective use of every taxpayers' pound spent on our public services. I am glad to acknowledge the commitment that local government is showing to that. Nevertheless, councils will still face demanding choices and tough decisions—just as we have had to take in relation to the Scottish block as a whole. However, working in partnership with councils, we have ensured that that will be managed equitably, and with a proper concern for the effect on the council tax payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank colleagues for listening patiently to what has been, inevitably, a lengthy statement. However, the matters I have outlined are important. After 18 years in opposition this is an important time. We have come to government to find an enormous amount that needs to be done. In the comprehensive spending review we have created a mechanism that will allow us to identify and act upon real opportunities for shifting public expenditure towards the targets that really matter. The redistribution that I have announced today is an important step on that road. The outcome of the spending review will open up new opportunities to Scottish parliamentarians to align resources in Scotland more closely with the nation's priorities. Today is an important start in realising those objectives. I have used new resources and the flexibilities allowed me by the block, to put in place a range of packages that respond to the pledges on which we were elected and which set us firmly on the course we intend to pursue and will, above all, improve significantly the lives of people in Scotland. I commend my proposals to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Several hon. Members</i> rose—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), I remind the Committee that members should ask short questions and the Secretary of State should give short answers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of our moderatorial lunch at Dover house, I say to the Secretary of State that although I am about to disagree with him on several points, I shall try not to do so in a disagreeable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the 15th Scottish public expenditure statement, and the first from a Labour Secretary of State, since I was first elected to the House. Regrettably, it is the 15th Tory public expenditure statement that I have heard. As we know, the Government made a big thing before the election of their intention to don the straitjacket that the previous Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Michael Forsyth, had cast off. Although the Secretary of State may protest by saying that he has lengthened the sleeves by granting a bit more to education and the leg by granting a big more to health, it is none the less an ill-fitting garment for Scottish public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways in which the Secretary of State scores over his Tory predecessors. First, he has made provision for getting the devolution plans under way, a move that I am sure will be warmly welcomed by all members of the Committee. Secondly, while we all remember how Tory Ministers used to pretend that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0962">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
were increasing expenditure when we all knew that they were cutting it, the Secretary of State has made no bones about the pain that he is inflicting. That reminds one of those headmasters who used to say, "This will be painful, but it will hurt me far more than you". We want to identify the nature of that pain. An increase of £270 million in a budget of more than £14.6 billion is an increase of less than 2 per cent.—the rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the provision for pre-school education, which is more likely effectively to deliver such education than the voucher scheme that it replaces. However, in the light of the backlog of repairs and maintenance, which was calculated over 18 months ago at about £0.5 billion, does the Secretary of State really believe that an average of £6.7 million for each of the next four years to tackle that backlog and to improve information technology will be adequate, given the scale of the problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right in saying that the money for pre-school education will be ring-fenced, but that local authorities will be able to spend the other money that they will receive for education in ways that they think will best meet the educational needs of their areas? Does the Secretary of State accept that, notwithstanding his announcement today, more teachers will be made redundant, that there will still be insufficient money for books and materials and that, in some hard cases, some schools will still have to close? When does he expect to start delivering the smaller class sizes in P1 to P3 that the Government promised in their election manifesto?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the value of higher education to the Scottish economy—in addition to its intrinsic value of producing a well-educated Scottish population. The Secretary of State said that he was holding the higher education grant at a standstill in cash terms, which I am sure will be welcomed in as much as it is not a cut. However he did not make the same admission about the increased resources for further education. Will that figure be a cut in terms of what it will buy? The Secretary of State knows that, at the election, my party campaigned for £200 million per annum to be invested in education through a 1p increase in income tax. We still think that there is a substantial case for that investment in Scotland's education because even with the amount announced today, local authorities will have to find money from their budgets to maintain basic education. Every pound spent on education means £1 less to spend on the police, on social work or on implementing the recommendations of the Pennington report, for example. The problems will still exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On industry, I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement of an increase in the Scottish Enterprise budget. However, he was silent about the Highlands and Islands Enterprise budget, except to talk about the agency's role in training and the new deal. Will he say what that budget will be next year and whether that will represent a cut or an increase in real terms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the amount being made available for tourism. As the right hon. Gentleman would expect, I welcome the amount being spent on ferries, which confirms the announcement that he made in July in relation to Orkney and Shetland. I also welcome the additional amount for Caledonian MacBrayne, which I think is to meet safety requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
In dealing with not just Scotland's remoter areas but many parts of the country where agriculture is fundamental to the local economy, will the Secretary of State say what additional support he plans for farmers? Given that, this week, his Department made a provisional estimate of a 20 per cent. fall in incomes this year; and in the light of the fact that a statement is currently being made on the Floor of the House that will lead to further difficulties for Scotland's farmers, what additional support will be made available to help that beleaguered section of the community, which makes a valuable contribution to Scotland's economy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On health, can the Secretary of State confirm the figures that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) gave in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce)? If we compare the expenditure estimated in the Conservative Government's Budget last November for this year and next year with what is now proposed, the additional amount for Scotland will amount to only £4.4 million in real terms over the two years. As we know from the Budget, the amount for next year will come from the contingency reserve. Some people who work in hospitals have said that every year now they receive an emergency grant to meet the winter crisis—that emergency grant has almost adopted the status of a recurring grant. When the contingency reserve for next year no longer applies, how does the Secretary of State hope to maintain the same level of expenditure on health in succeeding years? We do not want to have to go backwards after the contingency reserve has been raided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to local government. As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said yesterday at Question Time, investment in housing can lead to long-term benefits in health, education and tackling crime. Why, then, has so little been done to reverse the serious cuts in the housing budget made by the previous Government? Does the Secretary of State accept that housing is indeed an investment that can pay long-term dividends and would therefore be worthy of far more investment than has been planned? What is his position on the 75 per cent. repayment of sale of capital assets, particularly in relation to council houses, which the Secretary of State for Defence, the right hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson), described on this occasion last year, when he was shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, as a draconian imposition on local authorities? Will that draconian imposition remain during the forthcoming financial year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the local authority budget, there will be an increase in aggregate external finance of 0.6 per cent., which is self-evidently lower than the rate of inflation. Given that local authorities, as we all know. are being given more and more responsibilities, there will inevitably have to be council tax increases, service cuts or increased charges for such services as meals on wheels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State estimates a 7 per cent. increase in council tax whereas, last week, the Chancellor of the Exchequer published a document among the pre-Budget report publications that estimated an increase in council tax for the forthcoming year of more than 10 per cent. Will the burden of that be borne south of the border or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
will the final figure be closer to 10 per cent. than to 7 per cent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were elected on the promise that they would not increase taxation. Scottish people must know that, when their council tax bills come through their letter boxes next spring, that promise will be broken. A tax increase is a tax increase, no matter how it is put forward. At least income tax has the merit of relating what people pay to their ability to pay. The people of Scotland will find the Government out when they realise the scale of the tax increases that they will have to pay to receive a limited—if, indeed, any—increase in services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am under instructions to be brief and I will do my best to be so. I do not want to accuse the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) of being uncharitable, but he is slipping into the Opposition mould with a determination and vigour that I find a little pathetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £270 million increase in the settlement on which the hon. and learned Gentleman poured such scorn represents a substantial increase—about £50 for each person in Scotland. Considering the plans that we inherited and the increase of 0.5 per cent., which we have now improved to 2.4 per cent., surely he recognises that that is a real achievement. I said earlier that we cannot do everything at once and that we are undertaking a slow and developing process. The hon. and learned Gentleman should recognise that it is important to be making sustainable improvements over a period. We cannot wave a magic wand in this business, and we cannot do all that we want to do; we must live within our restrictions. But the £146 million for education, the £106 million for the health service and the £50 million for housing that we have found represent substantial and impressive improvements.

I shall now deal with some of the other points raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman. On housing, it is worth remembering that we had to find not only the £50 million to which I referred, but the £30 million to which we were committed by the previous Administration in connection with the repaymentof the Scottish Homes debt. We have found room in the budget for more than £80 million for housing. The empty homes initiative will receive £7 million, £35 million will go into the new housing partnerships and £5 million will go into energy efficiency. It is easy to say that more money should be going into such areas. I recognise that, but given the record that we have inherited, our start has been sensible and rational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to capital receipts. They will be considered in the comprehensive spending review, the outcome of which I cannot prejudge. Money will be spent on nursery education; it is ring-fenced—as it should be. Because of the area that he represents, I appreciate his worry about the present agricultural problem. The statement made by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concerned a serious matter and followed the recommendations of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee. It will result in the deboning of beef for consumption. We are all aware of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
difficulties that will arise for the farming community. Most of the expenditure and difficulties under this budget relate to European funding and are not dealt with in the statement, but we recognise that problems are occurring. No one will deny that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stressed that the figure of 7 per cent. was an average figure and one that we wished to hold to; the decisions made by individual councils will determine where they fall on the range either side of that average figure. No one can expect uniformity, but the figure is realistic, given the settlement that I made earlier. The important point is that the settlement outlines an average council tax figure very similar to that predicted by our predecessors, but it is of course a settlement that includes a much more generous allocation for local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in Scotland will recognise that a balance has to be struck. We could go to one end of the range and murder services to reduce council tax. From the logic of the general political position of the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland—Liberal Democrats say that it is important to maintain services by raising taxes—he should be loudly complaining that the figure of 7 per cent. is too low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Income tax is fairer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, in opposition, the hon. Gentleman commends higher taxation to us, but the right approach is a balanced approach, which I think we have achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the £27 million provied for the health services, but what can be done about waiting lists—for elective surgery, in particular?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell my hon. Friend that we have found an extra £106 million, over and above the £100 million or so that was already in the plans, so substantial sums are being made available. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Bearsden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strathkelvin and Bearsden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you—my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). The geography of suburban places sometimes eludes me. My hon. Friend found substantial sums—more than £25 million, if I remember rightly—to provide for any difficulties that may arise this winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken steps to reallocate money within the existing budget for this year to meet that crisis. That is evidence of our recognition of the difficulties faced by the health service. I hope that the settlement that we have announced, providing more than £200 million in addition to last year's spending totals, will allow us to pull away from that crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service is very much on the Government's mind; that will become clear when we publish the White Paper on reform of the health service and a Green Paper that will look rather more widely at the impact of health provision on the quality of life of the nation. Those documents will be of widespread interest, and have clearly been backed up by spending commitments for both this year and next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I cheer up the Government members of the Committee by saying that I aim to exceed the time that the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland took to address the Committee this afternoon? However, I may be gracious to the Committee and spare it that fate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's statement covered the range of public expenditure in Scotland, but he omitted—as his predecessor did in a similar statement 12 months ago—to provide a real-terms assessment of the figures that he announced. The real-terms figures are far more interesting and illuminating than the cash-terms figures. Anything can look bright in cash terms, where inflation is part and parcel of the increased figures. What the Secretary of State has announced today represents a cut of approximately 1 per cent. in real terms in public expenditure in Scotland for the forthcoming financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter of enormous concern about what the Secretary of State said is the one-off items of expenditure that he announced. What confidence can we have that those one-off items of expenditure, which amount to a substantial proportion of the sums that he announced, will have any prospect of appearing in the Scottish Office block expenditure in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, the Secretary of State said that good government lies first in carefully identifying the country's needs and priorities, and then in maximising the output from available resources. When will the assessment of need within our community become so great that the Government will change the resource base that is available to meet those needs? I cannot help feeling that the whole basis of the settlement that the Secretary of State has announced is very similar to the thinking that was applied by his predecessor in previous settlements announced to the Committee or in other forums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State intimated that there will be new burdens for local authorities to manage in the coming financial year, and he referred to the burden of increased pension contributions because of changes in advance corporation tax. In many respects, it is reassuring that the Secretary of State made that statement because no other Minister has acknowledged the burden that local authorities must carry in dealing with those contributions. It has been estimated that Scottish local authorities will have to find £36 million—an enormous sum—in the next financial year to pay for those contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter that troubles me most about the local authority settlement is similar to that referred to by the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland. When the Government took office, they had a commitment not to increase taxes, but they have now put the burden on local authorities, which must increase taxes such as the council tax. That is unavoidable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has said nothing about funding public sector pay awards, which will create pressure within local authorities in the next financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has listed housing packages that amount to additional expenditure of £52 million, but the cash-terms increase in the budget is only £39 million, which suggests that £13 million must come
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
from elsewhere. It would be helpful to know exactly where that money will come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State trumpeted the increase in the budget of Scottish Enterprise, but there is a cut of £1.3 million in cash terms in expenditure on industry and enterprise training. Is that an appropriate decision to take when the manufacturing sector in Scotland is anxious about employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has referred to a £25 million increase in the funding of further and higher education. Many of us would not have expected this Secretary of State to have attempted to shield the fact that £22 million of that increase will come directly from students' pockets as a result of tuition fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's statement demonstrates the continuity between this Government and the previous Government. The Government have inherited and willingly adopted the previous Government's spending targets and obligations, but they are raising insufficient revenue to pay for the public services that we required. If the Government were to be more honest about public finances and taxation, local authorities—and those who lose their jobs during this winter or in the next financial year—would not be facing the difficulties that they face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. David Marshall. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am sorry, I call Mr. Dewar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I was receiving unusual protection from the Chair. I was about to welcome that initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) has made a number of points of some importance. He is absolutely right in that there is a real-terms cut of 0.4 per cent. in total expenditure if one takes 2.4 per cent. growth versus 2.8 per cent. on the gross domestic product deflator. However, it is right to remind him that a number of items which benefit spending in Scotland this year are outside the total expenditure and are not taken into account. For example, the £22 million spending on higher education that comes from fee income. The hon. Gentleman objects to that policy, but it is relevant to the first point that he made. The hon. Gentleman should remember that other factors, such as the £25 million for child care provision, must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I wanted to appear as an irresponsible political Santa Claus, as the hon. Member for North Tayside would have it, I could bring much cheer and joy this year, but I would also bring desolation and frozen winters for the next two or three years as a result. His would be unwise advice to take. Therefore, I am anxious that we start to build on the right priorities to enable us to make sustainable progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Tayside was wrong to suggest that we would not be able to replicate our policy next year. We are setting sensible targets. It is odd that he is complaining that we are being miserable while saying that he suspects that we will not be able to maintain the policy next year. He thinks that the settlement is totally unstable and inadequate and says that we cannot maintain it; there seems to be a fallacy in his line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Student fees have made a contribution. About £22 million of the additional money—the £17 million for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
universities and the £8 million for further education—results from the tough decisions that we took on student finance. I accept that that is unpopular—and in some places I have met the evidence of that unpopularity very directly—but I am determined to maintain a sound foundation for higher and further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Gentleman—I am sure that he knows—that even if the scheme had been in operation this year, almost 40 per cent. of students would pay no additional tuition fees. Another fallacy should be put to rest: those who have to pay tuition fees will have an enhanced entitlement to a loan. Some hon. Members have more recent knowledge of the realities of higher education and of student opinion than I do. I do not think that anyone is now arguing that there is no place for a recoverable loan as a way of financing students. I suggest that the Scottish National party takes that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not examined the Scottish Enterprise figures with sufficient care. I hold to the fact that, in gross terms, we were able to do better than the previous Government's predictions by about £14 million. I accept that Scottish Enterprise will find it hard going at times because every inward investment success brings additional expenditure. However, I am satisfied that that can and will be handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £30 million for the Scottish Homes debt repayment was a commitment that we inherited, and one that we have honoured. It is important that we should honour our commitments, but it is also important to change the priorities that we inherited from the previous Government and to ensure that they are in line with Scottish opinion. I hope that the hon. Gentleman gives us credit for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Shettleston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement. I note his comment that transport resources must be switched from roads to a more comprehensive transport strategy. However, I stress the essential economic, environmental and urban regeneration case that can be made for completing the last six miles of the M74 to the east and south-east of Glasgow and in Rutherglen. Will he give an assurance that when he comes to make a decision on the strategic roads review, that project will be given every consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend paddles his local canoe extremely elegantly.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the increased funding for custodial sentences. However, in the spirit suggested by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland, will he be fair to those who have to deliver the service and recognise that the settlement for police spending may result in there not being enough police officers to ensure that people are arrested to face those custodial sentences? As a former vice-chairman of a police board, I would welcome the more open spirit of government if the right hon. Gentleman were to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
recognise the stress that the settlement will put on the police force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the reasonable way in which he asked his question. As he can imagine, a great deal of hard thought went into the settlement. I hope that the GAE increase of £16 million—from £675 million last year to £691 million—will allow police boards and chief constables to operate without suffering some of the more alarming predictions that have been made in some quarters. Those predictions are not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to continue the same differential between the police service and other local government services that has marked recent years. For example, the police GAE increased by 7.4 per cent. in 1996–97 and by 9.7 per cent. in 1997–98. Local authority GAEs generally increased by only 2 per cent. and 2.2 per cent. respectively in those two years. The differential is enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police total standard spending settlement in England and Wales rose by 10.4 per cent. between 1994–95 and 1997–98, yet the GAE in Scotland, the rough equivalent, rose by 17 per cent. That does not mean that we do not value the police or that we do not want to do what we can to ensure that policing is effective and efficient. I give those figures as part of the context within which we had to make the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a significant increase in GAE, and I do not believe that there will necessarily have to be a reduction in police numbers or in the number of policemen on the beat. It may mean—I want to be fair—that the police will have to find ways to increase efficiency this year, as every other local government service has had to do in previous years. I believe that the settlement is fair and I certainly intend to give the police the wherewithal to allow them to provide the service that we all want to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. We certainly believe that that will be the case.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I should say that I was in Brussels this week, where I had the opportunity to discuss the matter with Commissioner Flynn—I have also discussed it recently with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies. As I have said before, we know the Commission's starting point, but we do not know where the line will ultimately be drawn. We are all anxious to ensure that Scottish interests are defended and that a fair system emerges. We shall no doubt discuss the subject in Orkney at the convention of the highlands and islands this weekend, as we are very much aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the £52.9 million to which the hon. Lady refers, that is simply a change in the cash flow and the profile of demand. As she knows, there is—to put it another way—an enormous flow in the demands that are made on the funds and the figure reflects that, allowing us a measure of flexibility. There is nothing mysterious about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how pleased I was to hear my right hon. Friend acknowledge the dreadful problem of homelessness? I hate to sound even mildly parochial, but I make a plea on behalf of Inverclyde council about the desperate need to renovate derelict areas of the Gourock waterfront. The council desperately needs an increase in the capital allocation programme to cover the basic infrastructure costs of eliminating the appalling dereliction in Gourock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend is saying; I know the area to which he refers. All I can say is that we will make all speed to tackle the housing problem in Scotland as a whole. I hope that the allocations will be fair, but I predict with total confidence that they will not be enough and that probably, given the backlog that we have inherited, they will not be enough for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we want progress; that is one reason why the £35 million, which is part of the £44 million capital receipts referred to in the table, is being dedicated to new housing partnerships. We are anxious to use existing resources to lever in partnership private sector finance, so that we can maximise progress for the people who are victims of urban dereliction. That aim is more important than any argument about methodology. We must make progress and use our cash for that purpose. I promise that we will be trying to do that in all areas in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has the support of the Liberal Democrat Committee members of the Committee for the various bits of additional expenditure that he has found. We welcome that, and recognise his goodwill and that of his colleagues. However, we are greatly concerned about the overall effect of his package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does he think that the package that he has announced will improve the position of councils which until today were telling me—and, no doubt, all the other members of the Committee—that they faced further cuts this coming year, on top of the cuts that they made last year, the year before, and the year before that, of 1 per cent., 2 per cent., 3 per cent., 4 per cent., or 5 per cent? Will councils still face significant cuts in their budgets? If so, does the Secretary of State have any idea of the figure that such cuts will represent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Will schools throughout Scotland face another cut in their individual budgets? Will the pupil-teacher ratio, for example, be worse than it is at present? Will the care in the community budget continue to be seriously inadequate, as it is in many areas? On the question of housing, is there any prospect of finding some more money for Scottish Homes, so that housing associations can resume the sorts of building programmes that were cruelly halted by the previous Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, voluntary organisations are suffering severely from cuts that councils have to impose on them because of their budgets. In many cases, voluntary organisations are going out of business altogether. They provide a vital service across the board. Can the Secretary of State find any method of providing a ring-fenced lifeline—if that is not too peculiar a metaphor—to help them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman can invent a ring-fenced lifeline, I would be interested in seeing a model of it—I mean a physical model, which might help me in my deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked wide-ranging questions, and I cannot deal with all facets of the matters to which he referred. I repeat: spending on services next year will be increased by 3.6 per cent., including the extra money for pre-five accommodation and nurseries. We have not pretended that that will remove all the pressures. The hon. Member for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: North Tayside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney)—Sorry, I have great difficulty with my European geography—referred to the impact of ACT. We accept that that is a genuine pressure point. It will not be easy, but it will be an awful lot easier than was anticipated, if we look at the plans that we inherited. We have provided for about £150 million more in spending power, with, we hope, roughly the same level of council tax. That is a bargain that many councils may have liked to have seen bettered, but it is a genuine improvement on what had been threatened. It is certainly the best settlement that we can afford within the bonds of prudence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the additional spending, over and above what the Tories planned. That sends an important and encouraging signal to the people of Scotland—who, after all, voted the Tories out at the election because they did not like the Tory spending plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my right hon. Friend accept that, welcome though that £50 million extra for housing is, it comes nowhere near matching what is required to tackle the scale of the housing crisis in Scotland; and that more money will have to be found?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What progress has my right hon. Friend made in implementing our manifesto commitment—I have it here—to review the rule that 75 per cent. of capital receipts of Scottish local authorities must be used to reduce debt rather than to invest in housing? That Tory rule—along with the equivalent rule for Scottish Homes that 100 per cent. of its receipts must be used to reduce debts—has taken hundreds of millions of pounds out of housing, worsening the crisis in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that my hon. Friend is perhaps a man not famous for his patience. It may be a rather longer haul than he would like; we can agree on that. My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Tayside, North—I am displaying my new knowledge—asked about the £39 million for housing. If they look at the public expenditure plan allocation, they will see further down the page that the housing capital receipts initiative will receive £44 million. We are allocating more than £50 million and we have had to discharge our obligation of £30 million to the Scottish housing debt. That gives the £83 million to which I referred, and it represents a significant start compared with what would have happened if there had not been a change of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that we shall review the commitment in the manifesto as part of a comprehensive spending review. That will allow us to have a tighter correlation between our priorities and our spending patterns. I hope that that will begin to have a real impact from 1999–2000, which is a short period, given the turn around and reexamination that has occurred. There is evidence of good intentions within the settlement, for which my hon. Friend will give us credit when talking to his constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I welcome the announcements on rail freight and, especially, on the A75—all four miles of improvement to which are in my constituency—in many areas of Scotland a lack of transport facilities are distinct disincentives to inward investment and industrial growth. I ask the Secretary of State not to lose sight of that in future, nor to treat the roads budget as an easy one to cut for pseudo-environmental reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State spoke about education and about heating half-empty buildings. I ask him to bear in mind that special circumstances apply to rural areas where the existence of a school, whether full or half empty, often equates to the existence of the community. Will he continue to ensure that the formula allocation for local authorities takes account of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I recognise the special difficulties of rural areas. I discussed such problems with, for example, repreesentatives of individual schools when I was in Inverness recently. I know that there are always special considerations in rural areas. However, local authorities have to take decisions that are often difficult and must lead to much agonising by those who take them. The hon. Gentleman will also understand that in some circumstances, such as when alternative accommodation is more than five miles from the school that is threatened with closure or when the school has more than 80 per cent. of its roll, the matter ultimately comes to the Scottish Office. Such decisions are taken carefully—no one is cavalier about them—but, as a general principle, we want there to be proper rationalisation. I think that the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland suggested—perhaps, in a throwaway line—that no school should close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman said that. I am happy to accept that I misinterpreted what he
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
meant. However, we must accept that there will undoubtedly be rationalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of roads, I understand that there is a balance, and I hope that no one will take such decisions on the basis of pseudo-information or prejudice. The substantial road projects that we inherited were to be built on a design, build, fund basis, which means that they will be paid for in the future by shadow tolling. We must carefully consider the implications for future budgets and the room for manoeuvre in future years for those who may then have our responsibilities. It is right that we stop, consider and try to get that balance right, but I accept that the matter causes anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Anne Begg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to hear the Secretary of State highlight education. education, education. The settlement contains hidden advantages. The extra £8 million that is to be spent on the national child care strategy and after school clubs, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) referred, will enable many lone parents, especially young women, to take up higher and further education opportunities. Does my right hon. Friend agree that that will increase their chances of improving their economic prospects and their children's lives? The provision of such opportunities is perhaps not obvious on a first glance at the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we made it clear that we have a priority to provide nursery places to all four-year-olds whose parents wish it. It is important that that is honoured and that is central to our objectives. However, our plans go wider than that; we also want the development of a child care strategy. After-school clubs that provide care and which allow parents—usually mothers—and particularly lone parents to work are important in that respect. I should like that strategy to become comprehensive as funds become available, to enable many people to do what they want to do—improve the quality of their and their families' lives and contribute more effectively to the community. We have a common interest in that and we shall try to work towards real improvements in that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne McGuire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a new hon. Member, I am somewhat astounded by some hon. Members' churlish attitude to the statement because it is the first one in 18 years to open, rather than close. opportunities. In welcoming the generous increase in expenditure, could I focus on a small but significant part of it: the additional money to the Scottish tourist hoard? I welcome the Secretary of State's recognition that tourism is a vital part of the economy in rural areas, but when he or the Minister of State speaks to the Scottish tourist board about making effective use of the additional resources, will they bear in mind that investment in tourism in small communities is vital and that we should encourage all-year-round, not just seasonal, jobs in the tourist industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that that is important. The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) has been in touch with the tourist board to ask it to bear in mind, in terms of the allocation of additional funds, the work of local tourist boards.

Tourism is a key industry and is often based in fragile areas where it plays a vital part in holding together the local economy and providing opportunities. None of us wants to forget that. The tourist industry has some way to go in terms of the constant battle to improve standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In response to the comments of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire), I do not wish to be churlish. It might be churlish not to acknowledge and welcome the extra funds that are being made available in the borders for our community health services; people in the borders appreciate and welcome that. However, I say to the Secretary of State that there is increasing concern in acute hospitals, not only in the borders but across Scotland, about the growing activity and demand on the national health service. Does he recognise the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) about the problems of one-off payments to the health service, which seem to be made every year? Will he move towards long-term planning in the health service so that poeple in hospitals and in community care can plan for the resources that they will receive, in not just the following, but succeeding years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we will, although without trying to be a smart alec—which might be a contradiction in terms [	<i>Laughter.</i>]—I say in response to the concern of the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland about the fact that those temporary payments were made every year, that it would be more worrying if they were not. Our revised provisional expenditure for 1998–99 in Scotland is more than £4.5 billion. The challenge of health service funding is substantial. That is why my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and the Government are working hard on their aspiration to divert funds from unnecessary bureaucracy in the internal market to frontline patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a lot has been done, I expect to make further progress when we start implementing the White Paper, which will be published shortly. The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale is right that we must look carefully at how those resources are used and try to get more mileage out of them. But we also hold firmly to the intention of increasing expenditure in real terms, year on year. The health service is central to the political credo of the Labour party. The hon. Gentleman can take some encouragement from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, am disappointed by the attitude of the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland. His is a knee-jerk reaction. Having recently been in a relevant position, I can say that local government has been listended to; my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has taken on board the priorities of local government. The improvements, an additional £80 million, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
relaxation of capping—which will be of significant importance for my local authority—and the spend-to-save initiatives that have been asked for clearly herald a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is that, on this occasion, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State sat round the table with local authorities and COSLA. The local authorities were involved in the discussions. They recognise that it is a tough but fair settlement, and welcome the fact that they were involved in the decision-making process—a significant change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. When making my statement, I paid tribute more than once to COSLA and its membership. Some difficult decisions had to be faced. We talked through those difficulties together. Inevitably, given the financial stringency that I have to observe, it was not possible to give the authorities what they wanted, but we were able to go to the limit and, to some degree, reflect their priorities and anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly pleased that the scheme will make manageable the substantial disruption that would result if the changes in GAE on the social work side and the phasing out of mismatch funds were not attended to, and on that and a number of other matters, COSLA was extremely constructive and helpful. It is the nature of the relationship between central and local government that one asks and the other often has to say no, but it is important that the talking should continue honestly and constructively and that people should be prepared to move from predetermined positions. That was the spirit of those talks, and I take this opportunity to express my gratitude for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. Will you ask the hon.

Like other members of the Committee, I represent a constituency that has a recurrent and serious problem with that, and I note that the proposed allocation of money is, in effect, a complete standstill. Is that realistic, given the new burdens that were imposed by last year's legislation on the issue? The problem affects a few areas in Scotland greatly, and people become very anxious at this time of year. New burdens have been imposed, yet the budget is at a standstill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that we have projected the GAE for flood protection. I accept that flooding causes great problems in specific areas. As I know from my own constituency, one of the difficulties is that flood protection work is extremely expensive; the capital costs of protecting a small number of houses can be heavy, although the risk is very real to those who dwell in them. I do not have the details at my fingertips but, if I remember rightly, the hon. Lady's constituency, which I know suffered grievously, received a subtantial sum—£18 million, I think—from the challenge fund and I hope that that at least was of considerable help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Liberal Democrats have identified a need for an extra 1p on income tax to cover areas of public expenditrue, and the hon. and learned Member was well known as an habitual penny-spender during the election campaign. The House of Commons Library estimates that 1p on income tax would raise £150 million. Will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State confirm that, in this statement alone, the Government have allocated an equivalent amount to education, an equivalent amount to health and more than twice that to our new deal? Will he use all his good influences on the constructive Opposition to encourage the apparently spendthrift Liberal party to put the limited and inadequate 1p back in its pocket and to support the Government's public expenditure policies'?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend seems to have provoked the Liberal shadow Chancellor, if I may call him that, who is looking quite pained. I am always glad to recognise such Ruritanian titles on these occasions. I do not know the status of the 1p promise and I do not want to spend much time of Liberal polilcy, as that is not my job, but I think that the 1p was specifically tied to education spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hon. Friend's point. Given the difficulties, I think it fair to say that our settlement is a substantial move in the right direction and I hope that that will be appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the Secretary of State's statement but I want, in particular, to ask about pre-five education. May I impress on him the difficulties in providing pre-five and nursery education in rural areas? Can he assure me that he and his Department will take all steps to ensure that adequate funding goes to rural areas, so that we can deliver what has been promised this afternoon for pre-five education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend can be reassured on that point. We took some flak when we allowed the voucher programme to run on into 1998, although we simplified it and made it more administratively comprehensible. We took some flak because it was felt that we ought to have just chopped it off as soon as we won the election. The reason we did not do that was that we did not want to disrupt nursery placements and the arrangements that parents up and down the country had made for their children; we were also conscious that there was a shortage of provision in some rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That breathing space has allowed us to check on all those problems and consult properly. The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office, who is in charge of those matters, tells me that Argyll and Bute council, for example, is on record today as saying that it has now achieved 98 per cent. of the places that it requires.

That is not to say that I do not commend the Secretary of State on an excellent settlement. I know that he takes into account the excellent work done by Falkirk council in reducing its administration costs, under all its budget headings, to the lowest in Scotland. In fact, I believe that it will now be used as an example for other councils in Scotland to follow.

On the question of waste management strategies, the framework in which I wish to raise the debate—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will hon. Members please leave the Committee Room quietly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Michie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already given the relevant papers to my hon. Friend the Minister, and hopefully he will not think that I just want a reply in the 15 minutes available to him; I also want the Department to pay attention to the points that I raise, so that something happens outwith this Room that will help to solve the problems in Falkirk, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework in which I wish to raise this debate is partly the national planning policy guidelines issued by the Scottish Office on land for waste management, and partly the European Union Council directive on the landfill of waste, which dealt with the subject of co-disposal, and on which a debate was held on Wednesday 2 February 1994, during which I made some comments. Also relevant is a document published by the Scottish Office with reference to the purpose of structure plans in the identification of land management. That purpose is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide for a network of sites for the disposal of controlled waste which is consistent with the proximity principle and promotes self-sufficiency in waste disposal".</p></blockquote>
In the section on local plans, the guidelines state that local plans should
	<br><blockquote><p>"identify sites according to the criteria set by the waste disposal plan and the structure plan"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide for facilities close to the source of waste production, taking into account the amenity of any nearby housing".</p></blockquote>
That is relevant to the Falkirk area at present, especially in Falkirk, East, where Kinneil Kerse tip has been identified in evidence given to a public inquiry by Stuart Morrison, a member of the environmental health staff of Falkirk district council, as a site likely from 1 October 1999 to be unable to take any further waste dumping. That was confirmed in the summing up by the Queen's Counsel who represented the council as being the time remaining to that site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same evidence, it was said that it would take two years to engineer a new site, and that such a site
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
could be up and running within three years. That evidence was given to a planning inquiry in 1995. Unfortunately, no new sites have been identified or engineered, so it appears that Falkirk council possesses no new site where waste can be dumped that could be engineered and up and running to meet that time scale. I therefore ask: what will the Scottish Office do about that? Given that it appears that its guidelines cannot be met, what does the Scottish Office intend to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence submitted about sites that were available was that they needed to have a life of 10 years minimum to 15 years maximum of waste dumping. It was claimed in the first submission that there were 11.84 years worth of waste sites available with Kinneil Kerse and Avon Glen quarry, which, at the time, did not have permission for the dumping of waste. It was thought that permission had been granted but, when the matter was investigated at the public inquiry, it was discovered that it had not been granted. Therefore, from 1995 there were 4.11 years available for dumping at Avon Glen and Kinneil Kerse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if, as a result of the wildest and most optimistic submissions, permission had been granted for the Avon Glen quarry—from which soil is being taken at the moment to dump on top of the Kinneil Kerse tip, as it is being re-engineered—there would have been a maximum dumping life of only eight years. I understand that planning permission has not been applied for in respect of Avon Glen. The guidelines state that we should try, under the proximity principle, to have sites within our district, but we have only one year and 10 months of dumping life left on any site in Falkirk, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the problem at the planning inquiry was that the director of planning's submission that adequate sites were in the possession of Falkirk council at the time turned out to be a falsification—not just a mistake. The QC for those applying for planning permission for other sites, not owned by the council, produced a document, showing clearly that one paragraph had stated that not enough life was available for such planning permission. He had to admit that the document had been reengineered. The original paragraph in the document stating that not enough life was available had been removed and a paragraph had been inserted stating the reverse: enough life for dumping was available. It then had to be admitted in the public inquiry that there was not enough life for dumping to meet the guidelines set by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shortly after those proceedings, the director of planning left under a cloud, with a large payment from the council. I think that he should have been sacked because, clearly, he was responsible for submitting the doctored document. The council then had to withdraw its planning objection to an application submitted by a privately owned site called Avondale quarry, and planning permission was eventually granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second site, Inveravon farm, is of great concern to me and is the reason why I am raising this matter. A company called Scotia Environmental Services applied for planning permission on that site. It was clearly in the minds of those who try to defend the environment against serious damage that the granting of planning permission would result in the pillage of a beautiful
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0971">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
piece of countryside. It was believed that such action would threaten the Avon gorge where the Avon river runs into the River Forth, and that the area would suffer serious pollution from seepage and leaching over time. The area was a site of special scientific interest in which there were some important heritage monuments and through which the Antonine wall runs. For those and many other reasons, the council objected to the planning application. The matter went to a public inquiry and was turned down by the Secretary of State's reporter. The problem is that one site owned by the council will run out within two years and another appears not to have been processed. Baptie's did a study for the council on Avon Glen that showed that if it were not re-engineered it would have only 4.1 years life left, and rated it as a D site; amendments were made and new proposals implemented and the site was eventually awarded a B. The rule of thumb is that, because of the environmental impact, a council will use a site that is a C or above but not one that is a D or below. The council has taken no action over that site in the past eight months, so there is only one year and 10 months left at Kinneil Kerse. It seems that nothing else has been provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been approached by many members of community councils and environmental groups, who told me that they spent up to £20,000 at the previous planning inquiry on defending themselves and the environment against the destruction of the beautiful Inveravon farm in my constituency and against the incursions on the environment that that would involve. They do not see how they can do that again and, sadly, the company has been—as the Scots would say—very fly. It made one planning application which was turned down; it then made another running behind. That is called a twin-track application, a means of attempting to persuade the council that it can overcome any of the five or six major objections that were made at the first planning inquiry and that planning permission should be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply concerned that—how can I put it diplomatically?—recent evidence from the council's planning committee is that it does not always accept the recommendations of its planning officials. Over the past four or five weeks, I have had letters from Polmont community council, pointing out that four major planning applications for industrial development on greenfield land—ex-farmland at Gilston farm—have been granted by the council's planning committee, against the recommendations of their planning officials. My deep concern is that should Inveravon ever land back on the agenda of a planning committee in my local authority, I have, sadly, no confidence that the authority would not grant it—even if the planning officials recommended against it. That is also the concern of my environmental groups and my community councils. The evidence that alerted me to that concern is the fact that the listed developments at Gilston and Polmont have been granted: F/96/0373, F/96/0374, F/96/0376 and F/96/0377. One was taken away, brought back and granted at a later meeting, seemingly against the officials' recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I am concerned that we could have a situation in which the council has designed nothing to carry out its responsibilities under the guidelines. My understanding is that it has no agreement to use the site at Avondale quarry, which has planning permission, and that there is no planning permission to extend Avon Glen quarry, which it also owns. It would take 10 or 15 years to bring it back to life, as recommended by the planning inquiry and the Scottish Office guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently noticed a request for tender of refuse disposal services in the bulletin for the European Union. It was put out by the new Falkirk council; it wanted someone to dispose of approximately 90,000 tonnes of waste and offered a payment of £7,200,000, which is about £6 a tonne. I do not know whether one could get waste dumped for £6 a tonne, so I am worried that that is a panic measure. We have no strategy, no long-term landfill sites; we are not keeping within the Scottish Office guidelines and I am worried that that will result in permission being granted to dump at Interavon farm, which would be an insult. People are worried that the planning process allows people twin-track applications, so that an application can be turned down at a planning inquiry and at the Scottish Office, yet can come in by the back door through yet another application. People can work their way through the process, wear people down and get away with despoiling the countryside. However, the council appears to have no waste strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Minister to reply by rehearsing the guidelines—I have seen them. My constituents, such as those in environmental groups and community councils in Bo'ness and Polmont, care about the environment and have done much work. They do not want to be dragged through the process yet again. We do not want the strategy, if there is one, to rely on Inveravon being given planning permission so that that beautiful piece of farmland is dug up and used for landfill, especially as planning permission has been granted for the site at Avondale, and the council claims that it could re-engineer the site at Avon Glen to take waste, rather than having it sent out of the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry about the European application because it could mean the privatisation of waste disposal in my district, which would have an impact on the employment prospects of those in my constituency who work for the council in waste disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which process creates a dialogue between the Scottish Office and authorities? Clearly, there are problems: space for dumping is running out, there is no strategy and panic measures are being taken to try to fulfil the authority's obligations as a waste disposal authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many matters—all well recorded in the press—show that the old Falkirk district council should not put in a good light. I was lied to by senior council officials, who assured me that they had planning permission for an adequate length of time. They had to apologise to the planning inquiry for two serious distortions of the truth. We thought all that was behind us because of the new council and new guidelines. We thought that the planning permissions would be in place to take account of the two most important matters: first, protecting the environment and proximity—that is, the rule in the Scottish Office guidelines stating that as much waste as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
possible should be dumped on a council's own doorstep—and, secondly, the long-term safeguarding of the waste disposal services within the Falkirk district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has been occupied, as have all members of the Committee, with today's statement on expenditure, I should like to know what he has to offer the environmental action groups and community councils in my constituency. They want someone to tell them that they will not have to go through the process again, then lose and see a beautiful piece of farmland turned into a special dump.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special waste is not just domestic waste, but chemical waste. Grangemouth is nearby, so much chemical waste is generated in my area. This is a matter of properly engineered sites, in which co-disposal is not used, which safeguard the environment for this and future generations. Our main concern is that leachate would puncture any engineered site and end up in the River Avon and the Forth. That would damage the environment all the way to Leith, which the Minister represents, where people are equally concerned about environmental problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the Minister's reply and hope that he will tell us that the Scottish Office will intervene and not leave the matter to the panic measures of an authority which has no proper waste management strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Chisholm)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) on securing this debate. If there is time, I shall set out in broad terms the Government's policy on waste management. First, I shall deal with the specific planning matters to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the hon. Gentleman was a council leader for many years, he will be well aware of the planning procedures with which we have to work. My hon. Friend may suggest how the planning law might be changed, but he will know that I am able to describe only what happens at present. Planning law is the responsibility of local authorities. Structure plans, which must pay heed to the relevant national planning policy guidelines, have to be approved by the Scottish Office, but once they are approved—Falkirk's guidelines were approved some time ago—it is up to local authorities to act in accordance with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little scope for Government to intervene, although it is possible if planning applications are called in. We shall then ensure that they are consistent with the relevant structure plan. Even if Falkirk council is minded to approve the second application referred to by my hon. Friend, it would first have to notify the Secretary of State. The Department will continue to monitor the position, but I hope that I have given my hon. Friend some comfort in relation to the second Scotia planning application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, a local authority has a duty to arrange for the disposal of waste that it has collected. It may do so within or outside its area, and it is at liberty to use the private sector if necessary. I agree with my hon. Friend that the proximity principle has been accepted by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Government, and it is desirable that the local authority should pay heed to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific planning matters raised by my hon. Friend, it is understood that, with the imminent closure of the Kinneil Kerse landfill site and in the absence of any comparable facility in the district, Falkirk council has an urgent need for additional waste disposal facilities. The problem of chemical waste disposal in relation to the petrochemical industries at Grangemouth was recognised in the Central 2000 structure plan, and it is a matter of concern that so little progress seems to have been made to satisfy that requirement. However, it was not accepted that that lack of provision meant that the applications should be determined without regard to the development plan, as had been suggested by Scotia. Indeed, my hon. Friend did not suggest that that should be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend gave some figures. Mine are broadly similar to his, but I have no doubt that he will intervene if he thinks otherwise. Evidence led at the inquiry suggests that there is a need to dispose of about 7.5 million tonnes of waste to landfill between 1999 and 2014, of which about 205,500 tonnes would be special waste. Within Falkirk district, there is provision for disposal of only 3.2 million to 4.2 million tonnes, leaving a maximum shortfall of 4.3 million tonnes, which would be less than the combined capacity of Inveravon and Avondale of more than 5 million tonnes. The Avondale proposal could accommodate 3.1 million to ones, which is almost equal to the minimum shortfall of 3.3 million tonnes.

Goalday Ltd. sought permission to extract sand, gravel and clay from an area of roughly 36 hectares, known as Avondale farm, part of which has already been subject to mineral excavation works. The company intends to make sue of the existing and proposed quarry workings for landfill purposes, eventually restoring the area by means of landscaping and tree planting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotia Environmental Services Ltd. proposed the construction of a containment facility at Inveravon farm for the disposal of local waste arisings from Falkirk district and special waste arisings from Grangemouth. The area proposed for landfill is 29.2 hectares and the disposal areas would first be excavated, and thereafter restored using the extracted materials. Time is short, so I shall not go into more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A conjoined public local inquiry, to which my hon. Friend referred, to consider the two appeals and the scheduled monument consent was held between 3 October 1995 and 10 January 1996. The report, which was accepted by the Secretary of State, noted that the Avondale site is set in attractive open countryside, although the site itself is degraded due to existing quarrying operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the draft NPPG on land for waste disposal, the Inveravon operation would involve extensive land raising, which would normally be discouraged because of its visual impact. The view was taken that the three petrochemical pipelines crossing the site were integral to the operation of Grangemouth and that realignment would cause considerable disruption to the operating companies. It was noted that, although 85 per cent. of the Inveravon site is prime agricultural land,

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department had not objected to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was accepted that the visual impact of the proposed development on surrounding settlements or on views from major transport routes would be minimal, but consideration was given to the principal views, which are from adjoining minor roads and from the restored Bo'ness and Kinneil railway line. The Secretary of State accepted that the impact of the landfill operation would be considerable and detrimental, expecially on the railway, which is a major tourist attraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all the information available to him, the former Secretary of State decided to grant planning permission for the Avondale farm proposal, subject to conditions and the satisfactory conclusion of a planning agreement covering the restoration, aftercare and monitoring of the site on completion of the landfill operations. He also decided that the appeal concerning the proposed landfill development at Inveravon farm should be dismissed and that scheduled monument consent should be refused for the proposed works at that site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will want to know the latest position on a further landfill application that he mentioned. I understand that, following meetings between Falkirk council and the applicants and their advisers, the council will formally be asked to determine the proposal. As I said, there is likely to be notification, so the Scottish Office will watch developments closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will be aware of a proposal by Environmental Reclamation International to establish a major waste reclamation facility at Baltic quay, Grangemouth. Although the proposal seems to be generally in line with Government and European waste policy, he will appreciate the fact that, as the planning application could at some stage come before the Secretary of State, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the proposal's merits at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the planning applications at Avondale farm, the Secretary of State decided to uphold the appeal, subject to the satisfactory conclusion of an agreement between the appellant and the planning authority. The purpose of the agreement was to make financial provisions for bonding and insurance to underwrite the restoration aftercare monitoring of the site on completion of the landfill operations. To date, the agreement has not been finalised, so a formal grant of consent has not yet been issued. I join my hon. Friend in hoping that agreement will be reached soon, which would go some way towards alleviating the problem to which he refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the more general issue of Government policy on waste management. The Government fully
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
support the European strategy for waste management, including the concept of a waste management hierarchy, which in order of preference is: first, reduction; secondly, reuse; thirdly, recycling and recovery; and, fourthly, disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, that strategy means that waste prevention should be the first priority for all national waste policy. Waste recovery should be promoted with a view to reducing the quantity of waste for disposal and saving natural resources by reuse, recyling, composting and recovering energy from waste. The choice of option for recovery must have regard to the environmental and economic effects. Reuse and materials recovery should be considered preferable where they are the best environmental options. There is a need to establish an adequate and integrated network of disposal facilities that incorporates the "proximity principle"—the disposal of waste as near as practicable to its point of arising. Finally, throughout the European Community, only safe and controlled landfill activities should be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is currently developing a strategy, although I do not have time to go into that in detail. I am sure that my hon. Friend will follow developments with great interest. It will remain the case that the Government are not easily able to intervene in such matters. I share concerns that there may be some shortfall in the immediate future, although fallback options are available to the council if local sites are not up and running in time. I shall monitor the situation closely, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will keep drawing the matter to my attention. In general, the responsibility lies with the local authority, unless particular planning applications are notified to the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not mentioned Avon Glen, the quarry owned by the council. There was a substantial dispute at the planning inquiry over its waste facilities and how long it had planning permission to operation. That is part of the equation and I understand that, just as with Avondale, nothing has happened on that aspect for the past eight months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to investigate that point.
