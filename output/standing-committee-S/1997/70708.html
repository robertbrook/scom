	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Can you confirm whether we still have the ability, as a Committee, to invite Ministers from all Departments to attend our proceedings? If so, should not we be making arrangements to hear from the Home Secretary at our next sitting and from the rest of the gang of four of English Ministers who are now running devolution policy instead of the Secretary of State for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the genuine point of order, Standing Orders allow Ministers from outside Scotland to take part in debates, but do not allow them to vote. The hon. Gentlemen's second question is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Islands Needs Allowance (Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to meet representatives from Argyll and Bute council to discuss special islands needs allowance status for the area. [5764]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking forward to visiting the council on 18 July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for that reply. I understand that a review is taking place into the funding of local government, but that it will not be completed for some considerable time. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware of the great difficulties facing Argyll and Bute council. Will he consider giving interim assistance that is equivalent to the special islands needs allowance, knowing as he does the number of islands in Argyll and Bute that are spread over a huge geographical and maritime area? I hope that the new Government can give us some help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly cannot give the hon. Lady that undertaking. Indeed, she would be astonished if I did. I am making a particular point of meeting Argyll and Bute council after the highland convention on 18 July and I have no doubt that it will put its case as strongly as the hon. Lady wishes—and we shall listen to it. A review, which we have agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, is taking place into the special islands needs allowance. It is important to establish the exact pattern of relative spending before we can contemplate making changes and that will make it difficult for the financial year 1998–99. The matter does not concern only the geography of the islands; there are special problems in other areas given the geographical spread of the Scottish highlands. Clearly, an overall balanced judgment must be reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Local Authority Housing</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to reintroduce (	<i>a</i>) slum clearance subsidy and (	<i>b</i>) derelict land grant to enable local authorities to demolish unwanted housing stock; and if he will make a statement. [5765]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Chisholm)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no plans to reintroduce either a slum clearance or derelict land grant to enable councils to demolish unwanted housing stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. Is he aware that the disposal of poor-quality, unwanted housing stock by demolition alone has added almost £3 per week to the rent of every council tenant in Glasgow? Will he give serious consideration to initiating some form of grant scheme that will enable councils better to tackle the specific problems of demolition and clearance of poor-quality housing stock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The slum clearance grant to which my hon. Friend refers was a grant for the demolition of private sector houses. It was abolished in 1990 with the agreement of COSLA. I am aware of the problems to which he referred and I shall have a meeting soon with the convenor of the housing committee in Glasgow to discuss them and other matters. We shall be returning to the subject in the Adjournment debate at 1 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that there will be a huge £192 million cut in money allocated to Scottish housing this year in the face of massive need, will any or all of the £66 million and more that will be saved by reducing mortgage interest relief at source in Scotland be allocated to meeting Scottish housing needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly in favour of greater parental involvement in and parental support for schools. For that reason, my first engagement in this post was to address the Scottish School Boards Association. Although we are committed to looking at the composition of boards and, possibly, their names, I am much more concerned about the minority of schools where there is either no parental involvement or inadequate parental involvement than about the great majority where there is supportive parental involvement, and the more we can build on that the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On parental involvement, is the Minister aware that in my constituency and, I think, throughout Scotland, parents and teachers feel strongly that the best way in which to improve standards in schools would be to provide the funding that schools so desperately need?

However, he made a valid point. For instance, I am led to believe—I have asked for a much more detailed report on this—that we have inherited a £200 million maintenance backlog for Scottish schools.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until the conclusions of the review are known, no further procedural work will be carried out on the major scheme to dual the A90, formerly the A92, between Balmedie and Tipperty. Work on minor improvement schemes, and on measures to promote safety, will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the A96, the current construction work on the Blackburn and Kintore bypasses will provide a further 10 km of new dual carriageway by autumn 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply, but does he recognise that there is a great deal of frustration and anger about the constant changes in decisions, particularly as they affect the Tipperty section of the now A90 between Ellon and Aberdeen? The scheme has been dropped, picked up and dropped again on three separate occasions. It was promised by the previous Government, but they broke their promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government undertake that the Inveransey improvement and the Keith bypass will be fully considered in the review, and will he deny what has been suggested in some press reports—that those schemes are not to be reviewed at all? A failure to consider them will not be acceptable in the north-east where there has been a great growth in traffic and population in the past 10 years. We deserve the same standard of roads as the rest of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that the previous Government dropped the Balmedie-to-Tipperty stretch from the roads programme. The other schemes to which he referred, such as the Keith bypass, were never in that roads programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are seeking to introduce a coherent rationale into road-building decisions and to replace the previous Government's make-believe roads programme with a real one. The previous Government may have promised the hon. Gentleman and his constituents roads here and there and bypasses at Keith and Fochabers, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
there was no money in the budget or the projected budgets to pay for them. The previous Government's roads budget projected for five years' time would have been wholly taken up by three major private finance initiative roads. That is the inherited cut roads budget that we have to sort out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In planning for the A92 and the A96, will my hon. Friend consider the possibility of a western peripheral route around Aberdeen, linking those two roads to the A90? In considering such a scheme, he may like to reflect on the importance of north-east Scotland not just to the economy of Scotland but to the United Kingdom as a whole. The scheme would be environmentally friendly, would relieve traffic congestion. It would also be popular, having the support of representative groups and councils in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scheme for the Aberdeen peripheral route has been developed by Aberdeen city council, and the route has never been trunked. However, I undertake that the scheme, along with others, will be considered in the strategic review that we are carrying out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a vehement defence of the Government's structural attitude towards their expenditure policies. However, does he not realise that, in December 1996, the Scottish Office suggested that bypasses in Keith and Fochabers would not only be amenities but were necessary in the interests of road safety? The Scottish Office concluded that three years might elapse before the schemes were carried out, so will the Minister tell us when the Government believe that work can be undertaken in the Keith and Fochabers areas? Keith is no longer in my constituency, but the areas share the same concerns. At present, we have a primrose path, with the additional penalty of the hike in petrol prices. We want action on transport in the north-east of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My earlier point was that the previous Government could not say when the Keith and Fochabers bypasses would come into being. They sent out messages that they would like to build them, but their forward programme did not include the money to carry those projects out. That is why I said we have inherited a make-believe roads programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the strong arguments for the Keith and Fochabers bypasses. I understand the environmental reasons why people in those communities want the bypasses, as well as the other arguments for them. I will be mindful of those issues as the review proceeds.

That part of the north of Scotland to which the hon. Members for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) referred—indeed, the whole of the north of Scotland—have lost nothing from our review, because the roads to which those hon.

I also acknowledge the difficulty that the Minister has because of the scheme that he inherited, intrinsically flawed as it was. Does he acknowledge that it is a near impossibility in sparsely populated areas to get a viable group of 20 pupils? Given that this year only £1,100 is available in the voucher scheme, will he give an undertaking that, if local authorities find it impossible to provide equal standards of quality for nursery provision in rural areas, he will treat that as a matter of urgency for the rest of the current financial year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentlemen's final point, there is no question of lowering standards. Every provider of pre-school education will be subject to inspection, so standards will be a fundamental consideration, whether the provision is large or small, urban or rural.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some experience of the matter in my constituency. North Ayrshire ran one of the pilot schemes and secured almost 100 per cent. provision on Arran, where there are exactly the problems to which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his reply. I raise this matter because there are some eminent establishments in Midlothian, such as Lasswade, Moredun, and the famous—or infamous—Roslin institution. The future seems to lie in biotechnology, yet funding for it is piecemeal and based on short-termism. The morale in the establishments is low, because people are on three-year contracts and when they are made redundant are paid accordingly. Will my hon. Friend get together with the universities and his colleagues at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to tidy up the provision to those important establishments and the many others in Scotland and ensure that they are properly funded on a long-term basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At this stage, all I can say is that the Government, as funders of research and education institutes and also as employers of contract research staff, are considering how to deepen and broaden the concordat on contract research staff career management. The work is being co-ordinated by the Government's chief scientific adviser. It involves all relevant Government Departments and Scottish Office officials are therefore very much involved.

That is a serious problem, and one that we are addressing positively.

I mentioned that there will be a Scottish task force; the budget in Scotland will be about £300 million. We are already looking forward and, hopefully, will get things moving towards the end of the year, but we have to lay the groundwork and put the machinery in place.

I am immensely encouraged by the response that there has been already. A number of people have contacted me directly about taking part and offering places.

Even in relatively affluent Aberdeen, there are people who are homeless and sleeping on the streets, but that is not the full picture of homelessness.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the Lord Advocates have all been advised by the same distinguished officials? In view of the information now emanating from the prosecutor's office in Frankfurt and in view of the information coming from Qum on the front page of 	<i>The Scotsman</i> this morning, is there not now a case for a fresh legal mind of the distinction of Judge Edward to look at the evidence of the Crown Office eight and a half years after the event?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to my hon. Friend, who has pursued this matter with tremendous persistence, that there have been a number of what he referred to as distinguished
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
legal minds on this case. A series of Lord Advocates has looked at it, and I am not sure that my hon. Friend's specific proposal is the appropriate one. However, there have been some developments. I notice that my hon. Friend describes them in the press this morning as absolutely sensational. It is apparently suggested that an Iranian intelligence defector has information about the matter. If anyone has such information, and if documents are available, the material should, clearly, be given to Dumfries and Galloway police, who still have an open file on the matter. I am assured that any new evidence will be investigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But would it not be a unique event in the history of the Scottish legal system if a judge were asked to consider the sufficiency of evidence before a prosecution? The point made by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) about the need for continual review is surely well taken. It is clear that sometimes additional information emerges almost weekly. What assurance can the Secretary of State give that the Lord Advocate is keeping the matter under constant review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that the file is open and of course substantial evidence will be examined. There has been much publicity recently about an article that appeared, last weekend, I think, in 	<i>Der Spiegal.</i> That was the first appearance of that account of alleged events in relation to the source to which it was credited. I told my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) that if new evidence appeared it would be examined, and I mean that. I know that that is also the mind of the Lord Advocate on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put the argument to the Prime Minister under the previous Government that if ever the perpetrators are brought to court, they should be put on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh and that no trial should take place in America. Will my right hon. Friend comment on that view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's remarks in the sense that I do not accept that, if the two people who have been connected with the offence were brought to trial, they would receive other than a very fair trial under the Scottish legal system. I am not of the view that in some way the forum for trial should become part of a bargaining process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
everything will be done to ensure that the despair felt by the Woodlock family and the New Stevenston community will not be re-experienced by another family and community in Scotland? Will he assure us that everything possible will be done to rid Scotland of the scourge of illegal drug taking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee when I send condolences to Andrew's parents and express our heartfelt sorrow for what happened. It is to try to prevent such incidents that we are tackling the drugs problem vigorously. We put in a considerable amount of money—£50 million a year. We have doubled the amount of challenge funding and we have several agencies. They must all work together to ensure that the appropriate work is done in and with communities. That is the only way in which we shall solve the problem and prevent what happened to Andrew Woodlock from happening again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister acknowledge that every constituency in Scotland is touched by the problem of drugs? Mine certainly is, and probably every hon. Member present is aware of similar problems and tragedies. Will the Minister comment on the reports in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> which suggest that the Secretary of State is thinking of reorganising or even abolishing the Scotland Against Drugs campaign? If that were so, the other parties involved—because it is an all-party campaign—would want to be consulted. I can perceive enormous advantages in continuing the all-party approach whether or not the campaign is to be reoriented. Will the Minister confirm that the enterprise will continue as an all-party campaign, above party politics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can confirm that. The campaign is an all-party one, and there will be no changes without the consent of all those involved. It is important to refocus the issue more into the communities. The hon. Gentleman will know that we have urged the agencies to become more involved and to co-operate with the communities, where the problem is. I think that they are doing that, but we are keeping the matter under constant review. The hon. Gentleman will be involved in all the discussions as a member of the advisory group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doran</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware, as the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) has pointed out, that drug taking is a problem in virtually every community in Scotland. In Aberdeen, there have been five deaths recently from heroin or methadone overdoses. Overdose cases at the Aberdeen royal infirmary are almost daily occurrences. Increasingly, we are aware that we need a co-ordinated approach, but recent announcements or press statements emanating from the Scotland Against Drugs campaign seem to militate against that approach. I wonder whether the Minister would comment on the efforts that the Government are making to ensure that throughout Scotland there is a co-ordinated approach against the drugs menace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The drugs problem does not easily lend itself to one simple solution. It is a multi-faceted and multi-factorial problem, and we need to take a number of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
approaches to it. One approach adopted by Scotland Against Drugs is to raise awareness and stop the fatalistic view that drug taking is inevitable. But there are many other approaches to deal with the problem and to help those involved in drugs. We must ensure that all the groups co-ordinate and that none has exclusive rights. We are keeping the system under review. The problem is being discussed at ministerial level and I hope that in the near future we shall be able to say something further about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>16. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to reduce offending by young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe in more systematic intervention to address the causes of offending, as well as offending itself. This approach ranges from supporting families under stress and employment measures in our new deal, to innovating projects, in association with the police, to tackle persistent offending and reduce youth crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In thanking the Minister for his reply, may I draw his attention to a recent survey of crime carried out by Coopers and Lybrand for the Prince's Trust, which is expected to report that the cost of youth crime in Scotland is more than £700 million and that almost one third of crime in Scotland is committed by people between eight and 20 years of age? If that analysis of the statistical base is true, it certainly confirms anecdotal evidence and reports by my constituents—especially reports of very young people behaving in an antisocial way at times when they should be at school or late at night when they should be in the parental home. What proposals does the Minister have for dealing with antisocial behaviour by very young people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to a research report being prepared by the Prince's Trust that will be published in September. He mentioned some material that has leaked into the public arena and said that the estimated cost of youth crime was £700 million. In human and financial terms that is far too much, but we must take a balanced view of what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is a long-term strategy to tackle the causes; clearly, the welfare-to-work programme is part of that. Secondly, we must ensure that we tackle the problem of persistent young offenders. There are a few in each community and, along with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, we are tackling that. We are looking for innovative projects in the community. I bring to the Committee's attention two projects: Cue Ten in my own constituency and Freagarrach, which are tackling the problems of youth crime in an innovative way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We, in the ministerial team, give youth crime the highest priority and I am sure that in the next two or three months, we shall develop policies that go to the heart of the issue and complement some of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

recreation such as youth cafés—or whatever they are called in different areas? He could bring together central and local government, charities and sponsorship to discuss such ideas. If he would like to see such a venue, I recommend the youth café in Edinburgh which, in a modest way, is quite successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the hon. Gentleman's constructive approach. We need, in co-operation with local authorities and voluntary organisations, to take a partnership approach to these issues. Essentially, we are dealing with the self-worth and self-esteem of adults and young people. We must focus on them, whether through education, economic and social policies generally, or housing and family. I am confident that this project will assist. We are willing to consider all options and avenues because the problem is important in Scotland. We are most willing to consider ideas from hon. Members; one of these will be framed as part of the community-based strategy because, in addition to tackling problems generally, we shall also work on the problems faced by young people at a difficult time in their life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Minister accept that young people learn antisocial behaviour by observing adult behaviour? Will he guarantee that legislation will be introduced to counter antisocial behaviour by neighbours, especially on housing estates, to give a better example to the young?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am happy to respond positively to my hon. Friend. Antisocial neighbours are obviously a major difficulty. We are keen to review what is now being done in Scotland to ensure the effectiveness and adequacy of tackling existing problems. We are awaiting the crime and disorder Bill which will be introduced later in the Session. We shall consider the window of opportunity for new legislative measures to tackle more effectively the problems that plague every community. In some areas there are fewer problems, but they do exist. This promise was contained in our manifesto, and we shall endeavour to move on the matter. I can reassure my hon.

I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise this as a very significant package of assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for the characteristic courtesy that he has shown me while dealing with the detail of this issue in the past couple of weeks. It would be churlish—to say the least—not to acknowledge that what he was able to say last Friday was a very helpful development indeed, if not yet the desired destination, which is the abolition of the tolls. His party suggested more than a little sympathy with our desire to abolish the tolls during the election campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Strictly speaking, the subject does not fall within the Minister's competence, but is a matter for the Lord Advocate. However, may I stress that what would help more than anything else at this stage—on the back of Friday's package of measures—would be for the Lord Advocate to take the sting out of the situation? He could do so by transferring cases from Dingwall to Portree and by decriminalising the entire nonsense that has been allowed to build up. He could allow the judicial system in the highlands to get back to the 18 months' backlog of genuine criminal activity that it now faces instead of continuing with cases against otherwise law-abiding citizens who have been criminalised through the previous Government's legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's views on the latter point are well known, and I note them. In a sense he gave the answer when he said that this matter is not within my remit, but the Lord Advocate's. He must consider such issues, and he is known to be reviewing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a manifesto commitment to review the operation of the tolls, and, by implication, to find a way forward. I am happy that we have been able to provide a significant sum, on an annual repeating basis, which will allow a substantial reduction on the discounted car fare for local residents and those who operate commercial vehicles and buses regularly over the bridge. That measure has been widely welcomed; I was especially pleased that some prominent members of the highland council were able to attend a press conference and make it clear that in their opinion it was an extremely helpful step in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McGuire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we agree that the deficit in good-quality rented housing affects communities across Scotland and that, in rural communities, the problem is often disguised by the general environment.

In my constituency, for example, the Rural Stirling housing association has had a significant impact on the development of high-quality housing for rent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to observe the strictures of the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that this Committee does not bear much resemblance to the Committee that sat before the general election and before the voters of Scotland had their opportunity to undertake their own selective cull. I thought that those who had never sat on this Committee before would miss the incisive intervention of Mr. Phil Gallie or the breadth of experience brought to every debate by Mr. Bill Walker, but one cannot help feeling, having reached Question 18 with some informative exchanges, that they are not really missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One difference in last week's Budget, which is the subject of our discussion today, was that it was very welcome to hear our Chancellor, who was declaring aims which I believe are far more in accord with the hopes and feelings of the majority of Scottish people than had been the case in Budgets over the previous 18 years. The Budget statement showed a concern for social justice. It expressed a commitment to tackle unemployment and the waste of talent which unemployment represents. The Budget promised measures to promote investment; it promised to build for the long term, a phrase with which I could scarcely disagree, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has used it incessantly over the last three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Criticisms of the Budget are based not on the Chancellor's objectives or the ends that he set, but on the means, and analysis of the measures proposed last week by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) show that they will not necessarily achieve their worthy objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be churlish not to acknowledge some of the positive aspects of the Budget—the improvement in child care provisions, the support for the film industry, which will have a particularly beneficial effect in Scotland, the cut in corporation tax, which was welcome, and the measures for small businesses, although even there the picture is perhaps not as rosy as it seemed at first. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury could perhaps say why, if double capital allowances are good for one year to stimulate investment, cannot continue for longer, because often the lead time means that the kinds of investment that small and medium-sized enterprises would want to make will not be possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reduced corporation tax for smaller businesses is welcome in itself, but it has made the distinction greater between companies that are incorporated and those that are unincorporated. Each small business person must judge whether there are mote advantages for the business for it to be incorporated. The matter must be of interest to the Chief Secretary. Is it the start of a trend or is it something that could change subsequently? Important decisions will be made on the basis of the tax regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, there will now be different rates of tax for Scotland's 250,000 unincorporated enterprises, including 40 per cent. on retained profits. It would be helpful to know whether in the overall review of taxation which we have been promised, consideration will be given to ways
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
in which small businesses that are unincorporated may retain profit for future investment without being subject to higher rates of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fundamental challenge to the Budget concerns the strategy pursued by the Chancellor. There was widespread agreement that there was a need to take some of the heat out of the economy. Rather than bear down on consumer expenditure, however, which most commentators agreed was running ahead of itself, the burden seems to be borne by companies and savings. The fact that it has not been borne by consumer spending and that today's inflation figures show an increase demonstrates that there is likely to be a further increase in interest rates—if not this week, then in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When responding to the debate, the Government must explain how they expect that a higher interest rate regime will help stimulate the investment called for by the Chancellor. We welcome the fact that the Government made the Bank of England independent, but it does not operate in a vacuum. It must take account of the fiscal regime set by the Chancellor. We believe that the regime that was set last week will make interest rate increases more likely. Given that the Scottish economy is more orientated towards investment goods production than the United Kingdom as a whole, how will interest rates help? [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State seems to be querying that remark. However, the Fraser of Allander Institute for Research on the Scottish Economy suggested that the figures were about 23 per cent. in Scotland compared with 17 per cent. in the rest of the United Kingdom. Scotland's substantial manufacturing industry is based on producing investment goods. [HON. MEMBERS: "Exports."] I shall come on to exports in a minute. But if interest rates are higher, how is that expected to help investment-producing industries in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the effect of higher interest rates on a higher value of the pound and to the problem that that will create for competitiveness for those who are engaged in exports. Given the importance of export markets to Scottish manufacturers, I do not believe that an overvalued pound will be helpful. Indeed, last Friday, Mr. Alf Young concluded his article in 	<i>The Herald</i> by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Brown wants a fundamental shake-up of investment attitudes in Britain, favouring the long term, favouring the industries of tomorrow which can cope with the challenge of globalisation and create new opportunities and new skills… But if the industries of today are being squeezed by dearer money and an over-valued pound, where will they find the resilience to invest in these new technologies and fresh market opportunities?"</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor had a choice and he opted not to squeeze consumer spending. The Chief Secretary owes it to the Committee to explain why the right hon. Gentleman chose a course that is potentially hostile to the interests of Scottish manufacturing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the measures that the Chancellor of the Exchequer took to tighten the fiscal stance of companies, such as the ending of tax credits on pension fund receipts. There is no such thing as a pain-free tax and some pension funds may indeed be in surplus at present. However, removing a substantial amount of money year on year, as the Chancellor is doing and as he will continue to do for years to come, means that pension funds must be dealt with when the time comes for employers to top them up. If companies must make up a shortfall, from where will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
the money come? Will it come from diverting money that would otherwise have gone into investment or will the shortfall be made up by cutting jobs? Again, the Chief Secretary should explain what thought process or behaviour the Chancellor thought he would stimulate by making such a change and how he thought that it would promote investment rather than choke off investment at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assessment did the Chancellor of the Exchequer make of the impact on local authorities which, if their pension funds are in deficit, will have to find more money from either higher council taxes or reduced public services? We should know what assessment was made of the policy's impact both on local authorities and companies before the Chancellor decided to go down that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main item of taxation was the windfall tax, which we believe is wrong in principle—the fat cats went off with the cream some considerable time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister scoffs, but if the Government had really been interested in taxing some of the fat cats, they would have imposed a higher rate of tax on those who earn more than £100,000 a year—that would have made much more sense and would have enabled them to take out of the taxation system many more people paying a lower rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that we have not heard the squeals of anguish from the utilities that many predicted. Let me give the Committee an example of what we are talking about, however, as we do not believe that there is such a thing as a pain-free tax. Scottish Hydro-Electric will have to pay £45 million, which is equivalent to its annual budget for improving the electricity line network in the north of Scotland. I am not suggesting that it will cut that investment, but that is the kind of sum that will have to be forgone to pay this tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The windfall tax will be used to fund the Government's welfare-to-work proposals. I have two points, which I hope that the Chief Secretary can reply to. First, will he say when we will know exactly what the relationship in delivering the programmes will be between the Scottish Office and the Department for Education and Employment, whose baby the policy is? The Department for Education and Employment has a good relationship with the Trades Union Congress in England, but how will it relate to the local enterprise companies in Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, especially as responsibility for the training function was transferred to the Scottish Office some time ago? We must ensure that the Scottish Office will have the opportunity to change the parameters if it is found that the proposals do not sit neatly in Scotland. Ian Robinson's appointment has been widely welcomed and companies have generally been constructive in their approach, as they want the proposals to work, but we want to be assured that the Scottish dimension will not be overridden because of the imposition of a template that has been made south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns the element of compulsion. If we are talking about quality jobs and quality training, there should be no compulsion. The fact that there will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
an element of compulsion raises the fear that we are going down the path of schemes that did not work in the past. That will only feed the cynicism of many young people who may well have seen their fathers fail on the youth opportunities programme and the various other schemes that operated in the 1970s.

If this one-off kick-start is to be translated into long-term, permanent jobs, will the Chief Secretary say what proposals there are for job placements? The Wise Group, whose activities have been held up as a model, takes considerable pains in interviewing people towards the end of their training period and in identifying their strengths; it has a good success rate in securing permanent jobs for young trainees. Will the Government's scheme be of similar quality in terms of attention to individual trainees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to a Budget measure that I think will have a serious impact on Scotland—the additional duty on fuel. Eighteen pence will be added to the price of a gallon in areas where fuel is already considerably more expensive. The Government are doing what the Tories did year in and year out, except that they are doing it five months earlier, in the middle of the tourist season when, no doubt, all the tourists in the highlands and islands will immediately notice the substantially higher petrol costs. The additional duty will add to business costs in areas where cars are needed for economic as well as social purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of reasons why petrol costs more in rural areas. One factor is transport and delivery, but perhaps the most important factor is the mark-up because of a lower through-put. Given that there is already a mark-up, the Government take a bigger cut—they impose VAT on the duty and on the additional cost. So the Government are taking advantage of the disadvantage already faced by motorists in rural areas such as the borders, Dumfries and Galloway or the highlands and islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent study for Western Isles council, Halcrow Fox estimated that some 600 jobs could be lost in the next 10 years because of higher fuel costs and the closure of petrol stations. The previous Government promised to undertake a study to determine the impact of higher petrol prices on rural areas, but most people in those areas believe that such a study is unnecessary; studies have been done and the evidence is there for all to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government acknowledge that there is a problem? It would be a start if they were to do so because the previous Government never properly acknowledged that there was a problem. If there is a problem, what consideration will be given to introducing offsetting measures? In our manifesto, we accepted that higher petrol prices would be needed, but we acknowledged that there should be offsetting measures such as a substantial reduction in vehicle exercise duty to £10 for vehicles of 1600 cc or less. Our studies and consultations with motoring organisations show that the majority of rural motorists would benefit from that reduction.

There is another possibility: a derogation from the full rate of VAT. That is done in Jungholz and Mittelburg in Austria, Corsica in France, and Livigno and Campione d'Italia in Italy, as well as the Spanish and Portuguese islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It says here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Secretary of State says, I am quoting a letter which my colleagues and I sent to the President of the European Commission in which we suggested that such a derogation should be made available in the highlands and islands and rural areas of Scotland. Indeed, this Thursday, my hon. Friends the Ministers for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy) and for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) and I will go to the Commission to press the case for a reduced rate of VAT on petrol in the highlands and islands. It would be useful to know whether the Government would support that sort of derogation, which is applied in other parts of the Community where high transport costs impede economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Minister for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and I have pressed the matter of air passenger duty on many occasions. The Treasury receives only a small amount of air passenger duty from airports on the islands in remote mainland areas, but it matters a lot to the economies of those areas. I hope that an exemption for those areas will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the hole in the Budget and the effect on public services of the decision to stick with the total expenditure plans and of the upwardly revised GDP deflator which the Chancellor announced in the Red Book. If there is a problem and the Budget threatens public services, perhaps the Chief Secretary will tell us where he stands on the threat to public expenditure in Scotland posed by the Home Secretary and announced in 	<i>The Guardian</i> today. The Secretary of State for Scotland says that he has beaten off that threat, but the Home Secretary says that he reserves the right to return to the matter. Previous Secretaries of State have said that such a reduction would occur only over their dead body, although they were sometimes tempted to introduce one. We should know the current state of play and whether the agreement on the Barnett formula, enshrined in the constitutional convention scheme, will stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland value their public services. During the general election campaign, we warned that the Labour party's sums did not add up and that it was raising expectations which would not be fulfilled. We specifically said that the abolition of the assisted places scheme would not fund a reduction in class sizes—a statement that is now almost accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, like a magician, the Chancellor conjured up more money for education and health from the contingency reserve. Leaving aside the wisdom of raiding the contingency fund, we must welcome that additional money—it is better than nothing or a poke in the eye with a blunt stick—but there is no new money for health this year and only a modest amount for school buildings. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) might care to explain what will happen in Scotland's hospitals if there is no money for health this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
If the GDP deflator and the additional money for education, health and housing are taken into account, we estimate that £85 million-worth of services will not be provided for from the money available in 1997–98, and that there will be only an additional £50 million in 1998–99. Of course, that does not take into account the fact that, even under Tory spending plans, the Scottish Office budget was due to go down in real terms. If last year's spending had been maintained in real terms, by the millennium we could have expected £1.8 billion more. Instead, we will get only £50 million next year. In commenting on the radio interview that my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) gave on "The World this Weekend", Andrew Dilnot of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The planned change in the real level of total public spending is much lower even than the extremely low figures that Kenneth Clarke was forecasting."</p></blockquote>
We want to know the implications of the revised figures. It is estimated than more than £100 million will be lost for education when compared to the plans of the previous Government. That will mean a loss of staff, a loss of music tuition, poorer books and equipment and a growing backlog of repair and maintenance work, notwithstanding the additional funds being made available this year. Although there may be some improvements next year—Government might avoid cuts and sackings—they will not lead to the further development and investment in education that are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the impact of no new money be on the health service this year especially as, according to the Chancellors's own figures, the money available will buy less? The Government might be able to find a little more money from savings on bureaucracy, but when can we expect that to come through? What will the impact be on the number of operations cancelled, particularly in the winter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has managed to negotiate £56 million more for Scottish housing over the next two years, but that contrasts with the £177 million cut which is already being experienced this year. I may be anticipating the Adjournment debate to be raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), but I recall—I think that the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh) was also present—that the former shadow Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson), told the conference of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that Labour would make known in days its view on the previous Secretary of State's requirement that local authorities use 75 per cent. of their capital receipts on debt reduction. That was back in March, but we are still waiting to hear Labour's position on the use of capital receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education, health and housing will all receive a little more money. Despite that, we still believe that there will be damaging effects on public services. However, what will happen to the services that receive no additional funding? They include social services, the care of the elderly, home helps, the implementation of the Children Act 1989 and the police, who are already under a lot of pressure with low spending power on an already tight budget. The Highlands and Islands police force has already said that it needs substantial sums of money if it is to provide even a basic service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, higher education was promised a stand-still budget after years of being told to make economies. It was told that its funding would remain the same in real
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
terms, but that will not now be the case because of the Chancellor's revised expectations for inflation. What will happen to higher education next year given the planned decrease in real terms in spending on Scotland's colleges and universities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has already had a meeting with the Minister of Transport about the dualling of the A1, but with little expectation of any assistance being forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm) described this year's local government settlement as rotten. However, that is the settlement he is prepared to stick with. In a debate earlier this year on public expenditure, the right hon. Member for Hamilton, South said that the money available did not meet Scotland's public sector needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have tight budgets, and we will have higher interest rates and, possibly, higher pension fund contributions and higher inflation. Unlike the previous Government, will this Administration admit that there is a problem with local government funding? The previous Government blamed everything on local government and would not accept that there was a problem. We shall make some progress if the Government are prepared to say that there is a problem. Will they acknowledge that, with no relief, there will still be cuts and sackings this year? Will they confirm that, with expenditure totals fixed and capping promised next year, our councils will have to consider even more service cuts? Will they confirm that that will be the effect of the Labour party's expenditure plans for Scotland next year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When winding up the debate in the House last night, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that the Government would report from time to time. The best report that they could give us would be to say that they will free themselves from the straitjacket of the Tories' expenditure totals and from the straitjacket of refusing to alter direct personal taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this Committee on 11 December last year, the then shadow Secretary of State for Scotland quoted 	<i>The Scotsman</i> attacking the previous Government for
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'increases' elsewhere revealed to be cuts, totals conjured which are mysteriously more than the sum of their constituent parts, money given loudly and proudly with one hand and removed silently with the other."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is what outside, objective observers say about the Government's statistical accounting forecast for the coming year."</p></blockquote>
We could repeat that now. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Opposition"—</p></blockquote>
who are now the Government—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be honest with the electorate."—[	<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 11 December 1996; c. 12.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that they will, and that they will tell us in detail, public service by public service, the effect of their budget and the revised expectations for public sector expenditure in Scotland during the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Shetland (Mr. Wallace) said, the landscape has changed since last we met. Perhaps we should pause for a couple of minutes to hang our heads and remember absent friends who are sadly no longer with us. It is a pity that they are not here because many of the difficulties to which the hon. Gentleman referred were created by our absent friends, the Conservatives. One reason that the Conservatives were kicked out of power on 1 May and removed entirely from their representation in Scotland was the position into which they had put the public finances and the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will come straight to the issue of honesty, which was raised by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland. During the election campaign, we made no bones about the fact that we knew that we would be inheriting an extremely difficult financial position. We knew that the public finances were not in good order; we knew that the economy was overheating and was not growing in a sustainable manner. In his Budget statement, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor proposed a number of measures that we believe will result in the economy growing in a sustainable way and creating the wealth that we need to improve living standards for everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that there are no quick fixes; it is not possible to come into office and put right all the problems that we have inherited from 18 years of Conservative Government. In the first part of his speech, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said that the economy was overheating; the second part of his speech was devoted to a huge wish list of expenditure that would result in the very overheating to which he referred. As so often with arguments advanced by the Liberals, their sums do not add up. They say whatever is convenient at the time without having to face the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While lambasting the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, the Chief Secretary said that the economy was overheating. Does he not recognise, as does the chief economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland, that overheating is a problem for the economy of the south-east of England, not for the Scottish economy? We are getting the economic medicine—and, more than likely, higher interest rates—to meet the problems down here in London, not the problems of the Scottish economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering when the hon. Gentleman would come up with that line, although I was not aware that the Royal Bank of Scotland had been

converted to the cause of separatism. The nationalists never take into account the impact on interest rates of having to run a separate currency, were there ever to be a separate Scotland. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who is not now present, said in the closing stages of the previous Parliament that the Scottish currency—the groat or the pound, or whatever it will be called—will shadow the pound sterling. If so, where is their independence? I do not accept the nationalist argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have taken the right decision on interest rates, and given the Bank of England greater operational autonomy. We wish to maintain interest rates so as to attain the Government's inflation target of 2.5 per cent. This involves taking decisions appropriate to meet that target.

The hon. Gentleman asked about corporation tax changes, which we debated last evening in the Chamber and will debate there again tomorrow afternoon. Opposition Members ought to bear in mind that the central point of the reforms is to reduce corporation tax, thereby helping companies to increase their wealth and to re-invest or distribute profits, whichever they prefer. After all, to a great extent the value of a pension fund depends largely on the value of the stock market, which has been growing since the Labour party was returned to power. We are creating the conditions in which companies' wealth will continue to grow, which, in turn, will benefit pension funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland asked about increasing fuel costs. I am glad that he had the decency to admit that for many years it was the Liberals' policy to increase fuel costs; the only time that it was not was during by-elections in rural areas. I recall the previous Kincardine and Deeside by-election when it was eloquently explained to us why Liberal policy was not what we had always thought it to be. I accept that the Liberals—as with everything else—have introduced a tax and then thought that people may not like it, so have come up with something else as a sweetner, in this instance reducing the price of tax discs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberals must, like the rest of us, face the fact that driving cars has costs, including an environmental cost. We shall be open to substantial criticism if we are not prepared to take appropriate action to ensure that people become more conscious of the cost of using their cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the points raised by hon. Members representing the highlands and islands and other rural areas, I agree that it does not need an academic study to realise that petrol prices are much higher in the more remote parts of Scotland. The problem with the Liberal solution is that if a differential rate of VAT was applied in the highlands, and a lower rate applied just over the border, petrol companies along the border would simply take up the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in my right hon. Friend's remarks about the disproportionate cost of fuel in the north. I agree, and have some sympathy. No doubt he is aware that petrol is 10p a litre cheaper in Hounslow, near Heathrow airport, than it is in Scotland. In London's Edgware road it is 7p a litre cheaper. Clearly the VAT paid on those prices will be much lower. Petrol appears to cost disproportionate amounts in different parts of the country, and I think that we should look into whether cartels are at work. Generally speaking, petrol is more expensive in Scotland than in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never had to buy petrol in Hounslow. When I am in that part of London I rely upon an airline to get fuel for me. Nor have I been in Edgware road. However, I take the point that there is a huge differential in the price of petrol not only across the country but around Scotland. Prices in Edinburgh vary from one side of the city to the other, mainly because of the discounted petrol sold by supermarkets. My hon. Friend is no doubt aware that there tend to be lower petrol prices in areas where there is a large supermarket. There is a problem in the highlands and islands, where supermarkets tend not to be. All of us who drive around Scotland are aware of the problem but I do not think that a differential VAT rate as one crosses the fault line between the highlands and the central belt is the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Skye and Inverness, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister acknowledges that there is a problem. He has ruled out the VAT route that we should like to explore. I believe that the Government have also ruled out variations in vehicle excise duty. Will any compensatory measures be proposed by the Government to help areas such as the highlands and islands with respect to fuel prices? Has he any proposals? It is one thing to knock down everyone else's ideas, but will he do anything about the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has asked the Scottish Office to consider those problems. I do not shrink from the fact that there are problems. Any of us who drive around the highlands and islands of Scotland are aware of that. The Government are of course taking other steps to help transport in the highlands and islands. The Skye bridge was mentioned a few moments ago and there is support, too, for Caledonian MacBrayne and P and O ferries—something that the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland will know all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland raised a couple of other matters that I should like to deal with. He discussed the differential between the tax of incorporated small businesses and private businesses, and companies will no doubt consider that issue, although the cost and consequences of incorporation will also be borne in mind. I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
the Scottish film industry. It is of immense importance not just in my constituency but throughout Scotland and we want to encourage it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The centrepiece of the Budget in many respects was our proposal to get young people off the dole and put them back into work. I am grateful for the qualified welcome that came from the Liberal Democrat party. However, surely now, after everything that has happened since the Budget, there can be no one who does not see the case for imposing the windfall tax. We have taken 7 per cent. of the profits made by the companies concerned, because of the way in which they were sold at knock-down prices. Interestingly, the relevant share prices went up the day after the Budget, which suggests that our judgment was right. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said that we should have taxed the fat cats. I do not think that that would have raised £5 billion—not even from Cedric Brown, or any of the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point on which we must concentrate is that for the first time a Government have policies that will get young, unemployed people and the long-term unemployed back to work. In a world where capital is increasingly mobile it will be the skills and training of the work force that will mark our country as a place to invest. We, unlike any past Government, have taken the steps to ensure that we shall be equipped for the future. That is a long-term investment which, I believe, the country will come to appreciate in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkeny and Shetland asked about the relationship between employment services in the United Kingdom and Scotland. Of course, they will work closely together, but the solutions that we are to set up in Scotland will be designed for young people and the long-term unemployed in Scotland. That is the point of a separate Scottish office—devolution, if one wants to put it that way—enabling the Government to adapt their policies to cater specifically for Scotland, while building on the strengths of being part of the United Kingdom, and on the experience of other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of what we are doing is that we are changing the culture in this country—it will not be possible in future for young people and the long-term unemployed to say that the Government are doing nothing for them. That is why there is an element of compulsion in the measures. I do not think that we should be naive about such matters. The employment that will be available will be of good quality—especially that which is being provided by the private sector. Mention has been made of the role of Ian Robertson of Scottish Power in that context. However, we must face the fact that some people may need to be persuaded to rediscover the work ethic and the benefit of education, training and all that they can bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second main complaint by Opposition Members was about spending. I shall outline the proposals that were set out in the Budget last week after I have discussed the nonsense that the Liberal Democrats floated at the weekend about allowances in respect of inflation. The fact is—as the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) conceded yesterday—that there is a real terms increase for health and education. The Chancellor made that point. I do not duck the fact that we have inherited a difficult financial position. We are building sensibly by allocating more money to the health service and schools to enable them to plan for the next two years. We are able to do that by being willing to face the hard decisions that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Opposition parties duck, because they do not have the responsibility. Our approach will benefit the health service and schools in Scotland in years to come because our decisions have been prudent and manageable. We have not done what the Liberal Democrats advocate, which is to spend money as if there were no tomorrow, without saying where it would come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon keeps mentioning the GDP deflator. He of course realises that it takes into account rising export prices. It would help me if he could suggest how that will affect local authorities and their spending decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Chief Secretary acknowledge that today's inflation figures show an increase in the underlying rate of inflation from 2.5 per cent. to 2.7 per cent., which suggests that the Chancellor's forecasts on the GDP deflator are likely to be correct? If the Chancellor is concentrating extra money on health and education next year—none extra this year—that money is welcome, but it will be eroded by inflation. Will the Chief Secretary tell us how every other head of Scottish Office expenditure—and, indeed all other Government Departments—will be able to meet that extra cost of inflation? When will he explain how it will be funded? Will it be from extra revenue from tax or from cuts? He cannot go on saying that it is not a real problem. It is a problem, so will he tell us how he will solve it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had been listening, he would have heard me saying that we have inherited a very difficult position and it would be irresponsible for us to pretend that that problem does not exist. In the key areas of health and education, for which we made promises in our manifesto, we have given a real-terms increase, which will benefit the health service and education in Scotland. The Opposition cannot get away from that fact. The health service and schools will benefit and, despite the difficulties that we face, we have been able to benefit both services in a way that was not thought possible by some people. I wish that Opposition Members would give us credit for doing that, although I understand why they have to indulge in ritual complaints. There is a real-terms increase for both those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would be foolish to suggest that everything can be resolved after just eight weeks. But it is difficult to understand why the Government have set themselves against using one means of raising revenue: income tax.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman no doubt read our manifesto in which we made specific promises on the top and basic rates of income tax. We made those promises because we knew that we could deliver them and intended to do so. The Liberal Democrats came up with all sorts of ideas on tax and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
spending. Of course, their great advantage is that no one every expects them to form a Government, so all that is necessary is to have a cursory look over such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. But in a couple of years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall say again, at the risk of upsetting my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Mr. Godman) who complains about long speeches, that we accept that we are in a difficult position. Everybody knows that. People voted for us in the election because we made only those promises that we were prepared to keep. We have stood by those promises and have delivered on them.

My right hon. Friend's Budget shows that the Government are determined to put the country on a proper footing. It is a Budget for economic stability. We have a plan for reducing the huge debts that the Tories left us that will encourage investment in industry. We have made changes to the private finance system that will encourage investment in our infrastructure. We have already announced plans for three major new hospitals, which is more than the previous Government ever managed in their term of office. We have implemented our plans for a fairer, tax system, reducing value added tax on domestic fuel to 5 per cent., which, with the abolition of the gas levy, will benefit many people living in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced a Budget which is beginning to implement the priorities of the people of Scotland. We were elected because people knew that the country could be run in a far better way. They knew that the country had to plan for the long term and had to equip itself for the future. That is the process which we started last week and which we shall continue for the rest of this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many parts of Scotland during the election campaign, we bopped to the music of "Things can only get better." Even the rather ineffectual public address system of the north Tayside Labour party campaign managed to play the tape once or twice. In the early hours of 2 May many members of the Government were dancing around outside the Festival hall on the south bank to the strains of the same music. I cannot remember whether the Secretary of State was there, but I am sure that he would have danced to the tune extremely well. You will excuse me if I do not sing an excerpt from it, Mr. Maxton.

It must be a surprise to many people that, after nine weeks in office, things are showing little signs of getting better. In fact they are getting a bit worse. I am told that the Labour theme tune was produced by D-ream. The dream is now turning into a bit of a nightmare for those who depend on public services in Scotland. People expected that this Parliament would bring an enormous change in Government proposals, but what we heard last Wednesday was a Budget steeped in the Conservative tradition—Tory spending targets were not simply maintained by the Labour Chancellor, but intensified with great zeal. Indeed, summing up the debate in the House last night the Chief Secretary seemed to be aspiring to out-iron the Iron Chancellor. People must be asking themselves what was the point of changing the Government when all they now have is a reinvigorated version of the Tory Budget presented last November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget was a missed opportunity. As the detail begins to be analysed and we begin to search for its fine points, the position becomes ever clearer. I want to look at three sectors of the Budget that are of particular concern to the SNP and the Scottish economy. Was the Budget right for Scotland? Did it match the mood of the economy of Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that has come out loud and clear from the Government is that the economy was over-heating and the housing market was moving at such a pace that some action was required. The housing market in the south-east of England is moving apace: London prices are 17.1 per cent. up on last year's, compared to an increase of only 2 per cent. in Scotland. Our economy in Scotland is driven by exporting and investment, whereas the economy in the south-east is driven by consumer spending. The Chancellor has delivered a Budget that tries to focus on consumer spending, but ignores the needs of the exporting and investment sectors in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has done a certain amount to slay the dragon of consumer spending, but almost every adviser says that not enough action has been taken to do the job full square, so the poisoned chalice has been left to the Governor of the Bank of England and his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee. It is a matter of regret that that committee does not contain a member of the Scottish financial community who could do something to refute the notion that the entire economy of the United Kingdom depends on what happens in the south-east of England; the economies of other parts of the United Kingdom must be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already told the Chief Secretary about the comments of the Royal Bank of Scotland's chief economist who said that a different monetary policy would be applied if Scottish conditions dictated the terms of the Budget. His comments were somewhat endorsed by Ian Duff of the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) and his comments on the concentration of over-heating in the economy in the south-east of England. It is reassuring that some respected economists are now coming to the conclusion that Scotland does not need deflation, but an imaginative economic strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point outlined by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) concerned the petrol price increase—a misdirected increase by the Government that directly hits rural communities. Those communities, who live in large parts of my constituency and in the constituencies of many other members of the Committee, have suffered enormously under previous Budgets. Cars
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
are a necessity, not a luxury. The Government—especially the Chief Secretary in his response to the hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy)—have not shown any imagination when it comes to finding ways of compensating rural users for the severe increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We estimate that the Chancellor's actions last Wednesday will increase petrol bills by about £60 a year on top of Tory increases of £300 since 1993. There have been two increases in petrol duty in nine months and petrol has increased by 20p a litre over four years. I suppose that 20p a litre does not sound very much, but when the cost of a litre now averages between 50p and 65p—depending on whether it is bought on the Edgware road or in Kinloch Rannoch—it represents a substantial sum. A bad idea on the part of the Tories has been intensified by the Labour Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some members of the Committee deride surveys of petrol prices, but let me inform the Committee of one such survey: the rural Scotland price survey undertaken for Highlands and Islands Enterprise. That survey showed petrol prices in the highlands and islands area to be between 17 per cent. and 19 per cent. higher than in Edinburgh, and goodness knows how Edinburgh prices compare with those charged on the Edgware road. In addition, many rural petrol stations, including some in my constituency, face threats of closure because of changed regulatory regimes and difficulties with petrol supply from the cartels and large companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a further penalty placed on rural communities by the Labour Government, on top of the decline in public transport services. That decline was engineered by the Conservatives, but the Chancellor's announcements last Wednesday give us no hope of increased resources for public transport services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been made of the wild commitments to new spending given by the Government. Prior to the election, the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), in common with many other hon. Members, assured us that abolishing the assisted places scheme would pay for the reduction in class sizes in Scotland. Of course, we have since had the revelation that those numbers do not quite add up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between a revelation and what appears in 	<i>The Scotsman.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will leave it to the Minister to correct the record when he sums up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As becomes apparent from the rest of the Budget announcements made by the Chancellor, the Minister will be trying to find the money from somewhere else. The real terms increase of 1.6 per cent. in health spending is welcome, but it is nothing like enough. Increased spending on education of £1 per pupil per week is nothing like the increase required to meet either the service provision limitations in Scotland or the chronic need for refurbishment of many educational establishments, such as primary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the central point of our debate—the point which the Government have been wriggling around since last Wednesday—which is how much new money is being made available for public services. The Chancellor has used new inflation estimates in the Budget—inflation estimates that have been applied to revenue totals but not to spending totals. The direct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
impact of higher inflation forecasts on the Secretary of State's budget will mean that by the year 2000, the resources available to him will have declined by £84 million. The new money for education and health is just old money clawed back from other areas of the Budget—we can take our pick as to whether it is industry, enterprise, housing, law and order or social work that is to be squeezed into Tory spending targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor is anxious to maintain the Tory legacy. Let us examine what that means for Scotland. If spending for which the Secretary of State has responsibility were frozen in real terms at 1996–97 levels, the amount spent during the coming three years would be just under £44 billion. The Chancellor's figures announced last Wednesday show that figure to be £42 billion over three years: a real cut of nearly £2 billion in Government expenditure in Scotland. Agriculture and fisheries will be cut by £260 million; £100 million will be cut from roads and transport; £130 million will be cut from the environment; £20 million will be cut from law and order; and £840 million will be cut from local authorities. I recall many Labour Members appearing in a newspaper photograph clutching a copy of the 	<i>Glasgow Evening Times</i> that said that the Labour Government would come to the rescue of cash-strapped local authorities in the west of Scotland. We have not heard any more about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the election, the Scottish National Party argued that the appropriate definition of new Labour was, "New Labour; no new money". It now seems to be, "New Labour; even less money". All those cuts are to be made in a country that the Treasury tells us has, since 1979, contributed £27 billion more to the United Kingdom than we have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ultimate Unionist argument was that as Scotland had a strong voice in Cabinet, Scotland's interest would be protected. We heard that once there, we could fight our corner and that people would act on our behalf. We heard that the former Members for Edinburgh Pentlands, for Stirling and for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale were our men in the Cabinet—allegedly. Now we are in an even stronger position and important decisions are made by the right hon. Members for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) and for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), and the hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell)—who, although not in the Cabinet, is a Minister at the Treasury. However, even with those three prominent Scottish Members of Parliament in the Treasury, we have found that the whole Budget is just another south-of-England Budget, inappropriate to the needs of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor failed to stem consumer demand in the south-east and, as a result, he will make the whole country and Scotland in particular suffer high interest rates. Earlier, the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary talked about fair taxation, yet people such as Cedric Brown, his successors and the fat cats will be paying no more income tax than they were before the new Chancellor took office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, the Chief Secretary said that the nationalists asked themselves why people voted for the Labour party and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"People voted for us because we told the truth"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 July 1997; Vol. 297, col. 712.]</p></blockquote>
As the Budget has unravelled in the past few days, we have found that that is far from true. It is time that the Government came clean on what really will be cut to make sure that their Tory Budget adds up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh dear, Mr. Maxton, the people of Tayside, North have found a worthy successor to Bill Walker. He never failed to depress when he spoke in the Scottish Grand Committee and I am afraid that the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) has gone out of his way to depress us again today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a subtle difference in the composition of the Scottish Grand Committee since I last took part in one of its debates. For a start, the majority of its members have become the Government, which is a novel, although welcome, concept for Scotland. Members of the eternal impossibilist minority are where they belong—in the official Opposition where, no doubt, they will be very happy. I note that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), who tries to represent my interests as my local Member of Parliament, is looking absolutely sublime at that thought. Those who have made a virtue of riding roughshod over the interests of the people of Scotland have been swept out of the Committee and away from Parliament altogether, and that is no bad thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been waiting a long time to say how much I welcome the Budget strategy. Over the past 18 years, I have lost a lot of hair, but I have survived and, indeed, I welcome the Budget strategy most wholeheartedly. We are fulfilling our election commitments; the right priorities have been set and I am convinced that people in Scotland will be enthusiastic about the tasks the Government have begun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have set in motion the collection of the windfall tax to fund a massive welfare-to-work programme—exactly as we promised. I look forward very much to seeing the fruit of that policy in my constituency of East Lothian, as I look forward to seeing the fruits of the policies of investing more in education, in the national health service and in housing. All communities throughout Scotland need that investment desperately and it must be good news that a start has been made as quickly as it has been made. Rome was not built in a day and Scotland cannot be reconstructed in one year or even five years. However, I am delighted that my right hon and hon. Friends have begun the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to pick up a theme that has already been touched on by my right hon. Friends the Members for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) and for Dumfries (Mr. Brown), who made his eloquent maiden speech on the Floor of the House yesterday. Road fuel costs in rural Scotland are something that some of us have been banging on about for a long time. The objective of the Budget tax increase on road fuel is to discourage congestion and pollution in cities and urban areas. We all support that. Even the Liberal Democrat party does. Indeed, as my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said, for a long time it has been Liberal Democrat party policy to load taxes on to road fuel, so I do not know why it is carping specifically about that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of our citizens are suffering double jeopardy on travelling costs from which they cannot escape. Cars and delivery vans in rural Scotland are not luxuries. In fact, one cannot exist in most of rural Scotland without access to a car. In large tracts of our country, there is no public transport. If there is a bus, it comes once or twice a week rather than every hour. It is just not possible for people to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
go about their normal business—going to the shops, getting to hospital or anywhere else—without running a car; people must have cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are higher fuel prices because of the oil companies' marketing practices and now there is the additional problem of higher fuel duty. We must deal with that, as we are talking about areas where a large proportion of people are on low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us have been raising this issue for a long time. I gently remind Liberal Democrat Members that I have been around long enough to remember writing in the winter of 1978–79 to the then Minister responsible for prices and consumer protection, the hon. member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), who is not now in his place—I wonder why? I urged him to deal with the problem of fuel overpricing in rural areas by the oil companies. I shall refrain from quoting what he said—I do not want to embarrass him any more than I did the previous time in this Committee that I quoted his words—but it was not terribly impressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is now responsible for consumer protection and I am confident that he will do better, as action is required to stop the oil companies making excessive profits in remote areas and cross-subsidising in a way that is patently unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one way in which the situation could be alleviated would be if the Government were to unfreeze the rebate on diesel fuel for passenger transport vehicles? The rebate was frozen in 1993, so that now, at the same time as a so-called green tax is being imposed on cars, a tax is also being imposed on the alternative of public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know—I have no doubt that my right hon. and hon. Friends in the relevant Departments are considering that and other options. What I am suggesting is that all Departments with responsibilities in rural areas—including, of course, the Scottish Office—should take into account the distinction between rural and urban motoring and devise ways of discouraging urban traffic without penalising those who live in rural Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be ways to do that. We were in opposition for a long time and it is practically impossible for Opposition parties to look at the nuts and bolts of such issues. Now, happily, the majority is in power and it is open to my right hon. and hon. Friends to instruct officials to examine these important issues—I hope that they will do so before the next Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by making a constituency point, which has already been raised by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, who claimed that his hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire had taken a deputation to the Scottish Office about the A1. My hon. Friend the Minister knows that that is a matter of considerable importance in the south-east of Scotland and, indeed, the north-east of England. I am puzzled by the decision to include the A1 in a 12-month moratorium on road improvements and I am worried about the implications that that may have. I hope to have an opportunity to return to the subject at a future date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time that I attended a meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee was as a member of the audience in Selkirk a few months ago. Hon. Members who were present will remember the packed Victoria hall in the town and the crowds outside. A lot of anger was on display in Selkirk—indeed, it was the focal point for the whole of Scotland as we came to terms with the previous Government's severe financial cuts to local government. Many organisations were represented at the public gathering outside. COSLA was well represented; its president visited my constituency with some frequency in the few months prior to the election. We hope that COSLA's interest in my constituency and the Scottish borders will not now decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that Committee, Ministers were lambasted for their failure to understand the problems facing Scotland, especially in rural areas, and for their unwillingness to recognise the financial crisis that faced local authorities. Many Labour Members took part in that debate. Since then, there has been a bizarre metamorphosis: having maligned the budgetary straitjacket that the Conservative Government created, the new Chancellor could not wait to have it fitted for size. Although it has been retailored, it is substantially the same garment, and the pain that it is causing—not just to the Chancellor—is still widespread in Scotland. There will be no change this year, but there is an acknowledgement that we are now living in higher inflationary times and that, therefore, the available cash buys less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be some extra resources next year, but nothing like the amounts that are widely acknowledged to be needed. Perhaps Scottish Office Ministers will consider returning to Selkirk in the near future and explaining how the Budget will tackle the many different problems that they spoke of and the anger that they demonstrated on that day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much talk of the windfall tax. Obviously, we Liberal Democrats regard it as unsustainable and retrograde. This will not be remembered so much as the windfall Budget but the shortfall Budget. There are shortfalls in education spending. I acknowledge the Minister's earlier response and last week's announcement on extra capital provision for primary and secondary schools. In my constituency the new Peebles high school is expected to cost £6 million and Stow primary school £1 million. That £7 million is a substantial amount of the extra money available to the Scottish Office. With all respect to Peebles and Stow, I am sure that many other places in Scotland also desperately need finance to put their schools back on the right track. We must consider whether the money available will be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also shortfalls in health spending, especially in rural areas. Trusts and health boards are grappling with short-term contracts which increase uncertainty and mean that there is the prospect of cutting the number of people who look after patients. Nurses' hours are being reduced, which cannot be good for patient care or for sustaining a first-class national health service. We had hoped that the new Government would deal with those problems more seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are small sums for education and health, but there will be increased grief in other sectors, especially social services. Surely it cannot be the new Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0911">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
preferred policy that local councils are considering the wholesale privatisation of their residential homes because there is no other way in which they can meet the budget shortfall with which they are being hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, there has been much debate of the effects of shortfalls in different parts of Scotland, but rural areas must come to terms with a second windfall tax—this time, on rural motorists. Many hon. Members have referred to the serious problem of the 18p a gallon increase, with VAT on top, in petrol duty. Certain Labour Members have said that Liberal Democrats have been in favour of green taxes for some time—indeed, we are, but we want the process to be equitable. There must be a balance in the way in which such measures are introduced, recognising the particular problems in rural areas, so our proposals on vehicle excise duty are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural areas need support because, apart from increased petrol prices, infrastructure is inadequate there. Various roads across the country have been mentioned. We cannot hope for economic growth unless there is substantial investment just to keep our roads up to scratch. We are not asking for huge stretches of wonderful new motorway through the borders or the highlands, but we should like recognition of the fact that existing roads need to be refurbished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past weeks, the new Government have been bathing in the warm glow after the election. The country has been understanding and it is pleased that a huge change has come and that the old regime has been ditched wholeheartedly. The Budget suggests that we have been living in a mirage and, as the cold chill of Tory financial budgets reasserts itself, we welcome the fact that the Government have acknowledged that Scotland is facing horrendous problems. But that is only a beginning. It is not enough to recognise the difficulties—it is important to deliver an adequate response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Pentlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to highlight and support two aspects of the Government's economic strategy. First, at the risk of unpopularity, I welcome the additional tax on tobacco products. That tax rise is unpopular with some of my constituents, but I sympathise with people who smoked for many years when the dangers were not recognised and who were encouraged to carry on doing so by expensive positive advertising. The tax rise is also unpopular with tobacco companies, but I have no sympathy for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of tobacco-related illnesses in terms of human misery and the health service is enormous. The tax and the use of fiscal policy will help to discourage smoking and, therefore, will produce enormous health benefits for the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect of the Government's economic strategy that I welcome is the fact that the Budget looks to the long term, not the short term. That is particularly important for health care. The health care budget, as we all know, is enormous and it is growing. The demand for new hospitals, new procedures and new forms of health care are ever with us. However, we must invest now in preventive health care and use our budgets not just on health education, but on that. What we spend on preventive health care now will save us vast millions in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
We must look towards investing in our children's future. The dietary lack that some children suffer because of poverty and the bad education that their parents received is terrible. If we do not deal with that, we shall build up enormous problems at an enormous cost in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's financial provisions, and I hope that they will continually bear in mind that we must invest in preventive health care even though we may not see the results of that for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not expect to have an opportunity to take part in the debate, and I am surprised that there are not more hon. Members on the Opposition Benches anxious to make points in it. They must be very satisfied with the Budget if they have so little to say about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw attention to certain aspects of the Government's approach. Nothing has been more welcome in Maryhill than the plans to ensure that jobs and training will be available for young people and single parents. I have spoken to people in both categories and single parents, for example, take great pleasure from the fact that, at long last, single mothers will be able to find job opportunities and the chance to retrain to update their skills. Such opportunities have been lacking until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, however, child care provision has been lacking. Statistical studies comparing this country with our European partners have show over again that, more than anything, it is the lack of child care that has prevented women from finding their way back to the world of work. The plans for child care are extremely welcome to single parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are aspects of the problem, however, that I hope my hon. Friends on the Front Bench will take into account. Single mothers have often found that when they went for advice on jobs or child care, they did not receive much help. They felt that the system was focused on single men and the jobs that they would be likely to go for. We need to focus on that problem to ensure that the advice given to single mothers is fully informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great disadvantage to women if they were advised to take a job and then found that it paid so little that they end up becoming worse off because of the way that the benefits system works. They need well-informed advice on how the benefits system will affect the hours that they work and the pay that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations such as One Plus already have vast experience of helping women to find work, training and child care and of giving advice. I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench will take up suggestions made by such groups. It will be a great step forward if women are able to find work. The difference between this Government and the previous one is that they want the system to work. They are keen to ensure that parents find their way back into work and do not have to live on benefits, but can earn their own incomes. The Government do not want people to live in poverty; they want them to earn a wage, be independent and able to promote their own interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the question of 18 to 25-year-olds. The vast majority of young people in that age group want to find work and training. But, as my right hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
the Chief Secretary pointed out, after many years of endless failure to find work, people begin to feel that they will never find work, so they give up hope and find a way of life that does not relate to going to work. That must change for young people's own good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is still concern for that to be done in a way that relates to their needs. Someone may have a good reason for not seeking work at a particular time, perhaps because of mental or physical ill-health, caring responsibilities for a member of the family, and so on. There could be many reasons why a young person does not want to take up a job opportunity at a given moment. I do not think that advisers in the jobcentres and the Department of Social Security have always been the most sensitive of human beings. We must ensure that they are well trained and properly informed, so that people do not have their benefit cut without very good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that an appeals system is satisfactory because many people will simply be too shy, young, ill-informed and so on to make use of it. They need to have a way into the system at the first stage rather than having to take up an appeal later. I know that that is not the direct responsibility of my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson), but the whole Front Bench team should consider the matter. We must ensure that the system is not seen as punitive. It is not; it is something that is very much for the benefit of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of other points that I want to raise briefly, such as the sale of tobacco, which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Dr. Clark) mentioned. I agree with her that tobacco has contributed hugely to the ill-health of our population and it must be discouraged in every way possible. I have some sympathy for the small local newsagent who sells cigarettes because supermarkets can buy in vast quantities and undercut him, which endangers the very existence of the small local shop. I wonder whether my hon. Friends have any intention of sorting out that anomaly. Perhaps the enforcement of a given price throughout all retailers might be the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to my final point. There are not many businesses left in my constituency. The largest employers are in the public sector, such has been the degradation of years of the ruination of the economy. Some firms exist because of the sales that they make abroad and, as they are in competition with companies in other countries, the current selling price of the pound makes it difficult for them to compete effectively. They understand that the Government are planning for the long term and that their objectives are to give businesses a sound footing to help them to compete in the world. But they are experiencing short-term difficulties now and I wonder whether my hon. Friends on the Front Bench have any comment to make on that.

I suggest that members on the Government Front Bench should go back and read some of the speeches that they made when they were in Opposition and recognise that they were extremely critical of the settlement that they are now defending, and which the Chancellor has made significantly worse by his announcement of the adjustment of the deflator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is recognised that the Government genuinely desire to improve health and education, for which they have found extra money. Although that money is eroded by inflation and there is none this year, the Government's long-term desire is to improve social services and quality of life and to meet the aspirations of people in Scotland. The argument, therefore, is not about the Government's objectives, but about the time scale and the decisions that they make now to deal with present problems. It is for a response on that matter that the Liberal Democrats are putting pressure on the Government. It does no good for the Chief Secretary just to turn away our valid criticisms of his present situation with cheap and ill-informed insults about Liberal Democrat economic policy, because he cannot escape the fact that, as the Minister responsible for public spending, he has a problem. A long procession of people will be coming to his office in the next few months pleading with him to explain how they are to live with the departmental totals that have been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even allowing for the adjustments that have been made on health and education, most of the extra money for next year will be eroded by the inflation effect and there is no extra money for this year in spite of the fact that worse inflation is forecast to bite in the current financial year. That means that every Department and local authority in the United Kingdom faces real cuts on the current budget, with no help from the Government, and the prospect of further cuts next year with, at this stage, no suggestion that the Government will help across the board. If the Government's health and education commitments, small as they are, are to be honoured, it will be at the expense of a serious cut in every other item of spending in the Scottish Office, and every other Government Department. We are entitled to ask Ministers to explain how that will be brought about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation faced by local authorities will present real difficulties. The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office will tell us that extra money is to go to education. When he appeared on television with me and others on "Crossfire" last Thursday his demeanour told me that he genuinely believed that he has enormous extra resources to deploy in education. I think that he used the words "big bucks", "big money" or "serious money", which he said he would have to put into education. I know that he is looking forward to doing that. However, the Minister may underestimate what is involved in delivering the goods. Perhaps one or two Labour Members who have been prominent in local government can see how the business works. Local authorities run schools and must finance them. Possibly local authorities' spending guidelines with respect to schools will be improved, without the revenue support grant being correspondingly adjusted. Local authorities will be told, "There you have it. You can spend more money on schools. You of course, however, get no extra money in your local revenue support grant and, unless there is a change in the regime, your council tax is still capped. You Labour authorities, go and explain Government policy for us." I suggest that, exactly like the Chief Secretary the minister may find a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
procession of local government leaders coming to his door, saying, "I'm sorry, Minister, we cannot deliver what you are looking for."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already acknowledged that the specific commitment in the Government's manifesto to finance a reduction in class sizes for primary schools, years one, two and three, out of the abolition of the assisted places scheme, will not be possible because the money thus released will not be enough even in Scotland where the problem is not as acute as elsewhere. I remind the Chief Secretary, who is very good at tossing abuse at Liberal Democrat costings, that we said that that proposal could not be achieved and we were right. The Minister has had to acknowledge that it cannot be achieved. We welcome his objective and share it, but we would institute that change for primary years one to seven, not just one to three. However, the real question is how the Minister will ensure funding for the proposal through the system, given the increased squeeze that the Chancellor of the Exchequer forecast. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland got it wrong: the Chancellor did not announce his adjustment to the deflator, he made no reference to it. One has to mine the Red Book to find it and then work through the figures to realise its implications. There are days when I wonder whether Mr. Kynoch has still got something to smile about because this looks a little like George Kynoch's revenge. If a Budget settlement, which he knew was unrealistic, has been further cut by the GDP deflator, he leaves the Labour Government with the inheritance. I think that something will have to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the city authority of Glasgow—Scotland's major local authority—faces the possibility of bankruptcy. That has never happened before and no one knows what the consequences would be. The Government clearly have to anticipate the severe problems facing local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that the city of Glasgow has said that it is impossible for it to live within current spending rounds. If we add to those the GDP deflator effect this year and next year, how can the sums possibly add up—unless of course the Minister is considering lifting the cap or giving Glasgow more money?. If neither happens, the council will simply be unable to make cuts fast enough to deliver a budget that could be regarded as one of solvency. Those are genuine difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the Government have inherited those difficulties. What we want to know is how constructively they intend to tackle them. Will they just wait until the squeals become louder, then finally relent and release additional money? The Chancellor has made a substantial tax hit—in ways we may not approve of. It is not that he is not generating revenue, but he has decided to stick within Tory spending guidelines; indeed, as a means of demonstrating his own macho political credibility, he now suggests that the guidelines will be even tighter. But it will all become untenable. As I said yesterday, there is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
tension at the heart of the Budget that simply will not hold. Something will have to give, and it is only a matter of time. It would help if the Government acknowledged that they must reduce spending and consider feeding through more revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the petrol tax issue discussed earlier, I have a suggestion for the Government. Petrol tax is a source of revenue that goes into Treasury coffers, but by no stretch of the imagination is it sellable as an environmental tax. This has not been a Budget for the environment. The reality is that the reduction in fuel bills, however welcome in individual households, is likely to lead to increased, not reduced, fuel consumption. The increase in petrol prices falls extremely unevenly on rural communities in Scotland. Yes, as the Chief Secretary said, we Liberal Democrats have supported petrol price increases, but with two important qualifications. The first involves annual upratings of which people are given notice year after year to enable them to plan for the consequences. The Government have effectively given a double hit in one year by increasing the tax after six months instead of twelve months—that was not within the automatic upratings. The second Liberal Democrat rule of environmental taxes is that any increase in revenue secured from them should be used entirely to reduce other taxes on wealth and job creation. The taxes would therefore be seen not as a source of raising money, but as a means of switching behaviour. We think that the Government should adopt that rule because only by doing so can they claim that such taxes are green taxes, not just another tax hit, another wheeze to get money out of the consumer to meet Government funding needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people will object to the fact that the Government are bringing borrowing down so fast that they will start to accumulate a potential surplus within two or three years. That is prudent budgeting, but when all our public services are in such desperate straits surely the answer is to start to relax the spending guidelines now, before crisis hits. That is what we are pleading with the Government to do—to be realistic about the situation that they face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all provide examples from our own constituencies of the sorts of problems we face. In the north-east of Scotland we feel strongly that the attitude that has pervaded the Scottish Office—it is perhaps understandable, but we think it is ill-informed—is that the north-east of Scotland is a privileged area owing to economic growth and expansion. We welcome the fact that we have had economic growth and expansion and that we have relatively low unemployment, and of course we acknowledge that other parts of Scotland have serious problems that need to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Scottish Office underestimates the pressures that growth brings. It is not unreasonable for us to say that, unlike other parts of the country, we do not have falling school rolls. We have schools bursting at the seams. We need to know how to house pupils next year and the year after—some schools are now above their limit and are reaching the point where it is barely safe for them to accommodate their current numbers. Yet when we say that we need funding capital consent to build a new Gairoch academy in Old Meldrum, Scottish Office officials say, "You can absorb those numbers in the existing schools". In a rural area it simply is not possible. Many of the neighbouring schools that might theoretically take those children are capped; they are also a long way away; some of them are under the control of a different
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
local authority with a different set of priorities. We want the Government to re-address that issue, as well as the question that I asked of the Minister with responsibility for roads. We have had a 20 per cent. increase in traffic over the past 20 years and nothing like a corresponding investment in roads, especially when compared with other parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to engage with a Government who say "Yes, we have a short-term problem and we shall explain to you how we shall address it before it gets seriously worse. We also have longer-term aspirations and we must start to prioritise our actions." Once we can engage with such a Government, we can have orderly and constructive debates in which it is recognised that not everything can be done at once, but people can at least start to hope that their aspirations will be met. Of course there is no quick fix and we accept that the Chief Secretary cannot deliver everything in eight to 10 weeks. However, it is not credible for him to admit that the situation is worse than during the previous Government's spending squeeze, yet not be prepared to explain what he intends to cut or how he will find extra revenue to meet the shortfall that has opened up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can do no better than conclude by quoting Alf Young in today's edition of 	<i>The Herald.</i> He makes a perfectly fair point. Referring to the Chancellor, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having helped secure that victory and having pledged his chancellorship to the open and accountable presentation of the nation's finances, he would do us all a great favour if he would now re-publish this year's and next year's departmental spending plans, taking full account of everything he did last Wednesday."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate which has been very interesting in parts. However, visitors to the Committee listening to Opposition Members' contributions would have had some difficulty in understanding that this is the most popular Budget for 50 years and that, as a result of it, Labour support in the country plummeted from 63 per cent. to 62 per cent. Although occasional concessions were made, the lack of magnanimity was quite striking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People know that Labour fought the election on a very honest programme. The people who are now attacking us for not making huge commitments to spend extra money attacked us before the election on the same grounds. The difference now is that they are trying to give the impression that we have not kept the commitments which they accused us before the election of not making. They cannot have it both ways, hard as they may try. People know that there are tough decisions to make; they know the Labour Government's priorities and they know that the principle on which Opposition parties work is simply to outbid us on anything that we do. We say that we will cut class sizes in primaries 1 to 3 and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) says, "We will do it in primaries 1 to 7."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to deal with some of the specific concerns that were raised. The cost of petrol in rural areas is clearly a source of concern across the divide, and everybody who represents rural areas in whole or in part knows why that is so. I am well aware that it is a long-standing problem. I am sure that in 1992, the Liberal Democrats fought the election in the highlands and islands, as everywhere else, on a policy of substantial rises in petrol prices without any refinement to that policy. [HON. MEMBERS: "Not true."] They now seem to have adapted it, and the new Liberal Democrat policy is that petrol should cost more except in Liberal Democrat-held constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is true that the Liberal Democrats have a long-standing and, in other contexts, principled policy of raising fuel-pipe prices for environmental reasons, but they are apparently prepared to play no part in recognising the difficulties of differentiation. The idea that there should be different rates of VAT which begin and end at Dalwhinnie is ludicrous. Maybe there is a new role for Aviemore here; it could become the frontier town of the north, where the petrol queues form to take advantage of a different rate of VAT. If that is the new Liberal Democrat policy on petrol prices, the party should rethink it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The good news is that the Scottish Office, under its new management, is currently undertaking a study into the effect of rural motor fuel prices and supply. In addition, the Office of Fair Trading has investigated petrol retailing in the highlands and islands and is due to publish its report soon, so we shall have a new basis of informed evidence on which to proceed.

I wonder in passing why this criticism is always directed at whichever Government are in power. It is the oil companies which set the price structures. I wonder whether some of these representations should be directed towards the oil companies, which clearly have the ability to structure their prices and discounts to the advantage of rural areas. Perhaps they could take some leads from the public sector and the way in which the post Office, for instance, delivers that sort of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a little about the two areas of policy that the Budget focused on strongly and for which I have particular responsibility in the Scottish Office. The first is welfare to work. My essential plea today is that nobody should rubbish, for party-political reasons, what is being introduced under the banner of welfare to work. This is a real opportunity to make an enormous difference not only to the lives of significant numbers of young people but to every community in Scotland that is blighted by the social consequences of long-term and youth unemployment. If we can make our programme work—I accept that every party represented here today will try to make it work in good faith—the long-term benefits will be substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In every constituency, we must encourage not only the big companies but the small and medium-sized companies of good repute to get involved in the employment option under welfare to work. That is the best option for everyone—it is the least costly to deliver but, more importantly, it will pay the young person most and, as all evidence shows, will give the best prospects for long-term employability. If we can get the maximum number of employers involved in an imaginative way—everyone, be they in the private, voluntary or public sectors, is a potential employer—and get young people on to the programme, it will make an enormous difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about big money; more than £300 million is being allocated for welfare to work in Scotland and we have a real opportunity to shape the programme to Scotland's needs. I am glad that there has been a warm welcome for Ian Robinson's appointment as chairman of the Scottish task force—the other members will be announced in the near future. That first-class group of people will work with the Employment Service, the enterprise network—the main deliverers of training in Scotland—and everyone of good will to make the welfare-to-work programme succeed. The opportunity is there to be seized.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland mentioned the WISE group, whose annual report I launched last week. Its operations are a model for welfare to work; the group delivers a 57 per cent. employment success rate for long-term unemployed young people within three months
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
of their leaving the training project. We want at least that rate to be reflected nationally. The principle is to offer good quality training linked to real employment whereby people have reasonable money in their pockets at the end of the week—that is the basis on which we want to take forward welfare to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody should rubbish welfare to work or talk about schemes. It is not a scheme; it is much more serious than a scheme. When I launched it in Drumchapel last week, people were unanimous in not wanting it to be called a scheme, as young people hate schemes—they have been through them, they have been conned by them and they do not want any more of them; they want something more substantial that will deliver much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked a number of questions about the new deal, including that of child care provision. I can assure her that the Employment Service will offer help and advice on job search, child care and training. The new deal for lone parents will operate on a voluntary basis—there is no punitive element. We agree that there is a need to give fully informed advice, and the Employment Service will seek to do that. As to the other matters that she raised, I shall write to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On education, let me take up one point in the brief time remaining. The hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney)—to whom everyone is prepared to give the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that he is not his predecessor—and the hon. Member for Gordon referred to a report in 	<i>The Scotsman</i> about the assisted places scheme. That report was totally fictitious; it was based on nothing at all. No one—certainly neither I nor anyone in the education department—has said that the abolition of the assisted places scheme will not pay for the cuts in class sizes. I cannot deal with stories that are plucked from thin air. If The Scotsman wants to be the mouthpiece of the private education sector in Scotland, determined to rubbish everything that we do, it will end up with an even smaller circulation than it already has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Budget identified significant new resources for schools: capital investment of £115 million over the next five years, and not even Liberal economics can make that disappear. We have inherited a school maintenance backlog of £200 million, and we are putting serious money into dealing with that problem in every constituency in the country. Next year, there will be £89 million extra for education in Scotland's schools. That money will give effect to the policies and the priorities that we stand for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although no specific promises were made on housing funding, I am glad that the Secretary of State has announced that £12.5 million will be made available for housing in Scotland this year and £43.7 million next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with which I am about to deal occurs in other parts of Britain. Although it is an injustice wherever it happens, it is made all the worse in Glasgow because of the sheer size of the problem, as I intend to demonstrate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In October 1989, Glasgow district council recognised the fact that there was a growing number of vacant council properties for which there was neither demand nor resources for improvement. That surplus arose because of the dramatic fall in Glasgow's population, the then Government's severe reduction in funding for housing and the promotion of owner-occupation. The vacant houses that resulted, left boarded up, were a blight on their neighbourhoods. With no resources for improvement, demolition was inevitable even for flats in my constituency that were still sound in construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1990 and 1997, the council demolished about 10,000 former council houses. The sites created have enabled housing associations and private housebuilders to build anew, and they are very welcome. However, the cost of demolition has been great—£41.5 million has been spent on clearing, securing and demolishing property. That sum has had to come from the council's housing revenue about borrowing consent. Everyone thinks that the HRA is used to repair or build houses. The council needs every penny that it can get for such objectives. Few have realised that so much has had to be spent on just clearing away unwanted buildings. If the council had had that money to spend on improvements instead of demolition, about 2,500 homes could have been repaired in that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the loss of housing stock has also had a major impact on Glasgow's huge HRA debt burden. The amount of HRA debt attached to the properties is about £100 million. The interest payments on that debt are paid from the rents of the remaining council tenants. Existing council tenants are paying more than £1.75 a week rent to service the debt on properties which no longer exist. More to the point, they have no more connection with those properties than I or anyone else in this Room has. That is why I chose this matter for debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much talk of taxes and mortgage interest tax relief, but this is a tax imposed solely on council tenants—to the tune of £91 a year each in Glasgow—to pay for those demolished properties. It is basically unjust that that should be an addition to their rent. Quite simply, I ask why that burden should fall on council tenants alone. If it were removed, £10 million a year in rental income could be spent on much needed repairs to their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be galling for tenants to know that they each pay £91 a year for houses with which they have no connection, but are made to wait for vital repairs to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
houses that they inhabit. Tenants could benefit from bricks-and-mortar expenditure on their own houses from that money, and that would also reduce the need for future borrowing, as trouble would not be stored up in the form of unattended leaking roofs and windows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further demolitions are planned that will cost about £27.5 million—again, money that will be diverted from repairs to buildings that people inhabit. The HRA debt attached to those properties amounts to £65 million, and that will add a further £1.20 a week to rents—or £64 a year, which, added to the existing £91 per annum, makes £155 a year in all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier days, Glasgow received slum clearance subsidy and derelict land grants, which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) mentioned earlier. Today it is Glasgow's council tenants who pay for the restructuring of our run-down areas. Granted that housing benefit to tenants on income support contributes to that debt as well, the injustice to tenants who pay rent remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not all. Since 1970, about 7,500 units of council housing stock have also been transferred to other owners. Currently, the stock transferred carries an average debt of £10,367 per unit, and council tenants also pay the debt on those properties. I have a letter from Councillor James McCarron, the housing convenor of Glasgow city council, to tenants organisations in which he points out that at present in Glasgow, owner-occupied housing is
	<br><blockquote><p>"being built in peripheral areas in receipt of Grow Grant, which is a subsidy in excess of £10,000 through Scottish Homes, and tax relief on the mortgage for the owner-occupier who buys the house",</p></blockquote>
none of which Mr. McCarron objects to, and neither do I. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is manifestly unfair is that the council tenant who is paying a rent is in receipt of no subsidy at all. Consequently council rents are rising beyond the income of many people who are in employment, resulting in social polarisation in council areas where the houses have become uneconomic for people who are not in receipt of housing benefit to rent."</p></blockquote>
Not only is there no subsidy, a kind of tax is being imposed on council tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the council's housing debt, £176.8 million relates to demolished and transferred stock. Taken together, demolition and stock transfers suck out £19 million a year that could be spent on repairs and improvements. In 1996–97, tenants were paying for both those programmes to the tune of £3.63 a week, out of an average rent of £37.11. That totals £188.76 a year. The average rent is now £40.11 a week, and the new amount of that tax on tenants is £3.83 a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

fair to point out that council tenants who pay their own rent should not be bearing such a great burden to fulfil that policy. As I was going to say, the current proportion taken from their rent is 9.54 per cent., which comes to £199.16 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I raised the matter with the former Minister with responsibility for housing, he asked me who should pay. I do not intend today to solve all the problems of local government finance; I am happy to leave my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm), who has responsibility for housing, to ponder the matter. It is clearly unjust to lay all the burden at the door of council tenants. If this illogical and unfair system continues, I foresee that one day one remaining council tenant will carry the entire debt burden for the city of Glasgow on his or her rent. That is absurd. Logic and a sense of fairness should require us to recognise the anomaly now and to begin to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that in earlier days the problem may not have mattered because housing support grant and other subsidies made up the difference. Those days are long gone. Today, we are left with a rank injustice to council tenants that must be put right. We all have enough to do to pay our own debts; it is contrary to natural justice to expect council tenants to pay the debts for houses that have nothing to do with them. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the justice of the case that I have made and promise to give those tenants a fair deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). Although I am originally a Glaswegian, I wish to introduce a wider perspective on the issue of housing debt in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contacted that worthy organisation COSLA this morning for statistics on the level of debt in the rest of Scotland, and the figures are staggering. Councils throughout Scotland are paying £385,592,000 in interest and other charges on servicing housing debt. That amounts to £627 per annum, or £12 a week, for each council house in Scotland. I know that a string of statistics is not particularly exciting, but I ask the Minister to look at the issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give figures for individual councils. The debt of North Lanarkshire, which is my own council, works out at £8 a week per house; in Midlothian, it is £6 a week per house; in Aberdeen, it is £8 a week per house; in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
Glasgow, it is £20 a week per house; in Edinburgh, it is £17 a week per house; and in Dundee, it is £8 a week per house. Those resources could be used for house-modernisation programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest, single problem that many peripheral housing estates face is the lack of modernisation programmes. Little attempt has been made to tackle the old fuel poverty, which causes terrible health problems in inner cities. I hope that the Minister will consider the problem of debt and redirect resources to deal with such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We put the poorest people in the most-expensive-to-heat houses in Britain. Fuel poverty stems from that real problem. It creates additional problems in health and in poor educational achievement, and it will have an effect on the welfare-to-work programme. People need help because of the state of the homes in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider the issue in the long term. It is important to the well-being of the people of Scotland. However, at present, the debt burden lies with individual council tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have to learn the rules as we go along. I agree entirely with the two speeches that have just been made. The points that they contained illustrate the complete muddle in housing finance—a subject which we need to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our complaints of the new Government is that they have not looked closely enough at the net of financial arrangements tied around them by the previous Government. They should cut themselves loose from some of those stupid arrangements. Even a normally Tory-type organisation—the Housebuilders Association—has argued that housing finance should be dealt with differently. We need to consider both the capital aspect and the rent aspect, which were correctly described in the previous two speeches. I hope that the Government will examine housing finance as a whole, because at present we are penalising the worst-off people. Many people cannot go to work because they cannot afford their unassisted rent, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Chisholm)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) has raised an important issue, which is of great concern to tenants and local authorities throughout Scotland. I have been made aware of that issue in my own constituency because I have many council tenants who pay higher rents than those in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
Glasgow, although I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) said about the debt element being slightly less than in Glasgow. This is a complex issue and we have only 14 minutes, but it is a matter to which I have given some attention and will give more because it is clearly a key issue in housing in Scotland. I shall be meeting Councillor McCarron, the convenor of the housing committee in Glasgow, very soon to discuss this subject and a range of housing issues in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of introduction, I shall pick up the point mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth. Every year in Scotland, £500 million is paid to service those loans. The simple fact to make clear at the start is that if council tenants do not pay that £500 million, someone else has to do so. We must clarify that because it has sometimes been suggested—by the Scottish National party, for example—that somehow the debt can be magicked away. As long as we accept that someone has to pay for it, we know the parameters of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real result is that £192 million will be taken out of housing in Scotland because of compulsory debt repayment—that will affect the construction industry, small businesses and employment. Angus council has one of the lowest capital debts in the country, yet it will lose millions of pounds that could otherwise benefit the community. Will the Minister reconsider compulsory debt repayment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the point that I have already made. Somebody has to pay. It is the same in the general account and the housing association sector, where rents are being used to reservice loans to build houses. It must be done by somebody in every sector of the economy. We should be clear about that so that we know the general parameters of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill focused mainly on transferred stock and demolished stock, but some general remarks about the position in Glasgow and debt in general would be appropriate. The key figures are that Glasgow has 12 per cent. of the Scottish population and 17 per cent. of the total council housing stock, but 26 per cent. of the total Scottish council housing debt. That is, in a sense, a reflection of the high levels of investment in housing in Glasgow in the past. I am not saying that that was not necessary, because we recognise the housing needs of Glasgow now, just as we have done previously. However, the point should be made that Glasgow still receives a higher net capital allocation for housing—25 per cent. of the Scottish total—than it would require in simple population terms. I accept that that is necessary because of Glasgow's housing needs, but is has caused Glasgow's particular debt problem—quite apart from transferred and demolished stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right-to-buy scheme has often been instanced as a contributory factor, but in strict financial terms, right-to-buy receipts across Scotland have been greater than the average historic debt per house. Until now, we in Scotland have—unlike our English counterparts—been able to reinvest that money within the housing stock; although Scotland and England have now been brought into line with the 75 per cent. rule. But again, in a sense, that has fed into the debt problem. No one is saying that Scotland did not need that housing investment or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
that Glasgow especially did not need it, but it has meant that the debt has kept growing because receipts from council house sales have not been used to repay debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to make a clear distinction between the debts relating to houses that people occupy and the other debts which I mentioned earlier that have nothing to do with them. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will focus on that new point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so, but I thought that it was right to set the context because the issue on which I am concluding relates to the 75 per cent. rule which the Government are reviewing. One reason for its introduction was to deal with the debt problem although clearly it has wider implications for public expenditure and public borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fully aware that a particular aspect of Glasgow's housing problems has arisen as a consequence of the transfer of stock to other landlords. While in these cases the council has received a capital receipt, the sums involved would tend not to cover the historic debt associated with these properties, which were often in serious disrepair. That is the negative side of the transfer from the viewpoint of the council and its tenants. It has to be said—my hon. Friend will accept this—that there has also been a positive side in that stock transfers have enabled additional investment to be brought into housing in Glasgow and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the new housing partnerships that were flagged up in our manifesto, we will certainly have to focus on this issue because on the face of it, a problem occurs if stock is transferred and the debt accumulates on ever fewer council tenants. I acknowledge the problem with stock transfers that my hon. Friend raised. We are examining it. The recent HACAS report, commissioned by the Scottish Office, contains a great deal of detailed research findings and information in its attempt to address the problem. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that, in the context of the new housing partnerships, we shall examine this key issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue, demolitions, I find quite intriguing. These will increase the burden on remaining tenants if the associated debt is retained within the housing revenue account. I emphasise that I used the word "if" because debt on demolished stock can be, and is, transferred to the general account by other Scottish councils. My hon. Friend should raise that point with Glasgow councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend say whether transferring the debt to the general account makes it disappear, or am I right in thinking that that simply transfers it to the generality of council tax payers in a city such as Glasgow who, in most instances, can ill afford that burden? Since the houses that are no longer needed were built at the urging of Government is not it reasonable that the Government, having urged the demolition, should pay some of the cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend listened to the beginning of my speech when I pointed out that obviously someone has to pay for this debt. There is a choice between Glasgow council tenants and the population as a whole. My hon. Friend clearly wants to transfer that further, to the Government. I shall, if I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
time, come to the general point about the extra money that we are putting into housing. But, another question arises for my hon. Friend. If the Government were to bear that debt, and given that the figure for demolished stock might be, as my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill suggested, £10 million, the choice would have to be whether Glasgow should get £10 million for that purpose from the substantial extra resources given for housing, although obviously they do not cover all Scottish housing needs. Choices would have to be made. Given that dilemma, does my hon. Friend think that that would be the best way in which to spend housing money, given Glasgow's position relative to other Scottish councils which, no doubt, have particular requirements, perhaps of a similar kind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said this morning, the slum clearance subsidy mentioned by my hon. Friend was paid towards the costs of demolishing private sector stock. Those subsidy arrangements were wound up a number of years ago with the agreement of COSLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of assistance from central Government to overcome Glasgow's and other councils' housing problems has been raised many times. Transferring this to central Government, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) suggested, would mean that taxpayers generally would have to fund these loan charges. That would mean either higher taxes or money coming from other programmes. From the debates this morning and elsewhere, we know the tightness of the Scottish Office block and the budgets of other Departments that they inherited from the previous Administration. As I said. I shall be exploring options with the convenor of the housing committee in Glasgow, but I am sure that members of the Committee can understand the dilemmas and the choices with which we are confronted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the extra resources for housing investment that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in his Budget. The Government have recognised the need for additional housing investment in Scotland and the Scottish block will benefit from a share of the £200 million announced by the Chancellor for this year and of the £700 million for next year. Scotland's share will be £12.5 million this year and £43.7 million in 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We plan to discuss with COSLA and Scottish Homes how we should use those additional resources. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that, subject to discussions, he has in mind that £2.5 million of the additional resources available this year will be used to support welfare-to-work schemes directed at improving the energy efficiency of our housing stock. The balance of the funding—f10 million this year—will be used to take forward our policy of new housing partnerships, drawing in private finance to supplement the public resources made available for housing investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, again, a choice has been made. Given that we recognise the scale of housing need in Scotland today, we want to complement public resources with as much
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
private money as we can possibly lever in. We flagged up the policy of new housing partnerships within the manifesto, so that we could try to lever in as much additional investment into Scottish housing as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) wants us to get round some funding problems in other ways by redefining public borrowing. It is an economic judgment whether housing finance should be redefined and, clearly, my right hon. Friends in the 'treasury have decided to keep things as they are. We must recognise the achievement of the new Labour Government. All previous Labour Governments coming into office have had runs on the pound because of doubts about their financial credibility. This time, the exact opposite has happened and we have to work hard to reach that particular position. We have made the right economic judgment, and if we cannot get public finances right we cannot help homeless people or anyone else in need in Scotland. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's plea for us to redefine borrowing and then let it rip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is too early to say how much of the additional funding that we have put into Scottish housing will be devoted to Glasgow, in particular, and how much will be devoted to other areas. The decision to make those additional resources available is clearly a substantial indication of our recognition of the need for additional housing investment in Scotland. That decision builds on our other housing announcements in our first two months in office. We have not just flagged up additional resources for Scotland; we have also said that we are determined to make better use of existing resources, both in terms of the houses that exist through the empty homes initiative—a matter on which clear guidelines will be issued at the end of this month—and the reviews that we have asked Scottish Homes to carry out on support for social, rented housing and on low-cost home ownership, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Ms McKenna) referred. That needs to be examined, too, and we want to set a new priority for rented housing and shared ownership, where people can be in between rented and home-ownership status. Hopefully, we shall also examine the option of staircasing down within that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In two months, we have launched many housing initiatives in Scotland. I referred earlier to the code of guidance on homelessness and the rough-sleepers initiative. We have undertaken a series of new initiatives as well as flagging up substantial public resources. We cannot reverse overnight the savage cuts imposed by our predecessors, but we can and must make a new start in meeting Scotland's housing needs. The Government are committed to improving the quality of Scottish housing and my right hon. Friend and I intend to ensure that housing receives the priority that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end my remarks by repeating that I will be meeting Councillor McCarron and that I will discuss with him the issues that have been raised this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
