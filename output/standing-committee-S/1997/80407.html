	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning everybody. We begin with the substantive motion for the adjournment of the Committee on health in Scotland. This sitting is due to finish at 1 o'clock and I ask hon. Members for brief contributions to enable me to call as many speakers as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Sam Galbraith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the general election the Government have made some of the most significant changes in the health service for a considerable time. Our aim is to develop a health service with effective policies that will take it into the new millennium, when it will play an enhanced role in transforming the health of our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have done much, but because I wish to speak for no more than 15 minutes I shall deal with only a few areas. I shall also emphasise the specific Scottish nature of what we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me start with expenditure. In our manifesto, we pledged to increase it in real terms year on year. Next year a total of £4.625 billion will be available for health expenditure in Scotland. That is a cash increase of 5.7 per cent. and an increase in real terms of 2.7 per cent. over inflation; it is nearly £250 million more for the health service. We shall spend £898 per person on health in Scotland this y ear; that is almost £900 for each woman, man and child. That, let me emphasise, is 22 per cent. more than will be spent in England. We promised real-terms increases and we have delivered them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the remarks attributed to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), who will speak for the Liberal Democrat party. He said that despite the spin the Government have to date provided only 2.3 per cent. extra for 1998–99. I suggest that he revisits those figures. The additional money that we have put into the health service is equivalent to the rise of 1p in the pound in income tax that was promised by his party. I have spent his 1p on income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) has also spent that 1p on income tax on education. He spent it twice on welfare to work. The Government have stretched one penny a long way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I assume from my hon. Friend's remarks that there will be an increase of 2.7 per cent. in the mental illness specific grant this year? That is only a fraction of the amount that he has just referred to, but, as he knows, that grant assists people with head injuries, in a sensible and practical way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mental illness specific grant is for a wide range of provisions within the community, and some of those deal with head injuries. I can assure my hon. Friend that that funding is guaranteed for at least another three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have increased expenditure in real terms by 2.7 per cent. and we have continued the attack on wasteful bureaucracy, to redirect resources to patient care. We have announced the abolition of the inefficient, divisive, internal market. As a result of those changes, over the next three to four years, another £100 million will be redirected from bureaucracy into patient care. We have promised increased resources and we have delivered them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper, "Designed to Care", and the replacement of the internal market are at the heart of what we are doing. The overall objective is a modern, patient-centred health service that will improve the reliability, effectiveness and responsiveness of patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key part of the modernisation of the health service is a simpler structure of trusts. From April next year we will establish primary care trusts across Scotland. They will be unique to Scotland and offer a new way to strengthen links between general practice and other parts of the NHS. The primary care trusts will emphasise team working, not competition. Nurses, general practitioners, psychiatrists, midwives, therapists, pharmacists and others will all contribute their expertise and skills. Bringing together the primary and community health services will help to overcome some of the unnecessary barriers that interfere with effective patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister suggested in the relevant document that there would be no blueprint for the establishment of primary care trusts and acute trusts, will he consider the possibility that individual areas might want a combination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right; there is no blueprint. We suffered in the past from the imposition of a blueprint throughout the country. With respect to the number of trusts—which is what the hon. Lady is talking about, although that issue is linked to types also—we shall wait for consultation. I hope to deal with that briefly, but I guarantee that there is no blueprint for the matters that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary care trusts will have strong links with secondary care. Each health board will establish a joint investment fund, which will be another unique feature of the Scottish health service. Through that mechanism the new trusts will work with the hospital sector to redesign care from the patient's point of view. General practitioners, community nurses and other community professionals will all have a key part to play in the management of the trusts. That fact will support the development of cost-effective and clinically effective services that will be responsive to needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
General practitioners and other primary care staff will also come together as local health care cooperatives which will be managed by them and charged to design and deliver local community services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trust reconfiguration is another aspect of the changes, and the question asked by the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0867">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
Moray (Mrs. Ewing) relates to that. As well as a change in the nature of trusts there will also be a reduction in their number. Each health board is currently consulting publicly on the trusts to operate in its area. The proposals taken together suggest that there will be between 25 and 29 trusts in Scotland, in place of the 46 hospital and community trusts at present. That is a significant reduction in trust numbers—and will result in significant reductions in bureaucracy. Money will be saved and redirected from bureaucracy to patient care. That will be a marked improvement on the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to the outcome of public consultation, therefore, I expect to be able to take decisions about the new configurations in the summer. I expect the new trust configurations to be up and running from 1 April 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on from his point about public consultation, will he comment on the concern that is felt, certainly in my constituency, that loss of trust status will lead to the concentration of health services—particularly with respect to the threat to Stracathro hospital, in which the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh) share an interest with me. It is thought that the concentration of health services will inevitably lead to cities such as Dundee providing more health care and the loss of health care in the peripheral areas of the health board regions. Will the Minister assure us that in the consultation process the need for local acute hospital services will be protected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to understand that the trust configurations and numbers are a management system. The clinical provision of services is a separate issue, being dealt with in the acute strategy review. Of course, a conflict in clinical services has been highlighted, between concentrating on critical mass to ensure that everyone gets the best possible treatment, and convenience. It is important to achieve the right balance. There will be no blueprint for that, but, although it is necessary to concentrate some services to ensure the best possible treatment, the Government are committed to local services and community hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always opposed the changes that took place in the 1980s. As a mark of our commitment to community hospitals, we have already given the green light to two new hospitals in the short time that we have been in office. One will be in Uist and the other in Ayrshire. therefore, our commitment to community hospitals and local care is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reducing the time people wait for treatment is one of the main priorities I have set for the NHS in Scotland. As we know, there has been a reversal of the downward trend in the past few months. I have already publicly expressed concern about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am determined to drive down both waiting lists and waiting times, for the benefit of patients. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on Tuesday 17 March that additional funds would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
allocated to the national health service in Scotland including £44.5 million, which will be specifically aimed at tackling waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That substantial frest injection of funds demonstrates a continuing commitment to driving down waiting lists and ensuring that they stay down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell us anything about waiting lists for elective surgery? They cause considerable anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Waiting lists have increased from 84,000 to over 86,000 in the past few months. I intend to reduce those lists. That is why we have put £44.5 million extra into solving the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
£20 million has already been allocated to health boards this month, so that they can draw up plans for tackling waiting lists in their areas. The first priority will be to tackle the number of people waiting for inpatient and day case treatment, but I also expect them to look at out-patient referrals and waiting times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish simply to throw money at the problem—that has been tried in the past and it has failed. For that reason, a further £20 million will be distributed later this year to assist actions that will influence more strategic change in service delivery, and achieve long-term reductions in waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to drive forward this work, I have appointed a high level professional and clinical support group under the chairmanship of Tom Divers, general manager of Lanarkshire health board. He will review the plans to be submitted by health boards, pursue particular problem areas, monitor the progress of health boards and trusts in reducing waiting lists, and identify good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My aim, and my promise, is that by April 1999, waiting lists will be shorter than those we inherited, and that we will maintain the downward trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have so far concentrated on acute and primary care. The needs of community care priority groups are equally important. Among those mental health is a key priority for the Government and the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland", which we published last September, is entirely consistent with our broad aims for all NHS services. They should all promote: patient centred care; care services that respond to individually assessed needs, and the importance of partnership planning and shared working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework will help staff in the health, housing and social work agencies to develop a partnership approach to providing care and integrated services for people with mental health problems. That is one of the themes of our policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The response to date has been positive, with each health board developing a comprehensive mental health strategy in line with the framework's principles, which will be progressively implemented for the benefit of patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have so far talked about treating people. In the last minute or so, I want to examine the big picture. Sadly, although health is improving in Scotland, it is doing so at a slower pace than in many other countries. No Government with a social conscience could tolerate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
such a state of affairs. If cultural attitudes and lifestyle have a bearing on health, so do the circumstances in which people live. Poverty and unemployment, poor housing and a bad environment are all inextricably linked to health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a fresh start with no more nannying and no more blame attached to people. That new start should build on an accepted fact denied by previous governments—that poverty is the cause of much ill health. If we do not tackle poverty, we shall not tackle ill health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore need a public health strategy that addresses the root causes of our health problems—deprivation, poverty, unemployment, poor housing and inadequate education. That is why we have promised to improve public health in Scotland with new initiatives and preventive medicine, which is exactly what we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have launched a Green Paper, which proposes action at three levels. First and most importantly, we must deal with life circumstances. Improving them by giving people jobs is probably the most important health measure that we could take. It would give people a future, a stake in society, the determination to look after themselves and the economic means to make the necessary choices. Together with a job, a good education and a safe and attractive environment in which to work are also important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is to improve people's lifestyles—not by nannying individuals but by providing them with information to ensure that they are not brought under undue commercial pressures. As long as they have a job, they have a future and the economic means to make the appropriate lifestyle choices. Thirdly, we shall take action on a number of health priorities such as coronary heart disease, strokes and cancer. Consultation on the Green Paper finishes on 30 April and it will be followed by a White Paper later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is much to be done to revitalise the health service and it is our strong intention to revitalise it. I am confident that the range of initiatives that we have announced and implemented will provide a firm foundation to achieve our common aim—a health service that will provide people with what they need, when they want it and be of the highest possible quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of the time and effort of the House of Commons over the past year has been spent on Scottish constitutional matters to the exclusion of virtually everything else. Worth while and stimulating as the many hours in Committee on the Floor of the House have been, the opportunity to talk about something else will be welcome to many hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we recover from detailed scrutiny of part IV and schedule 5 of the Scotland Bill, a debate on health offers a reality check. I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that the state of the health service is of greater concern to people in Scotland than the minutiae of reserving xenotransplantation or the subject matter of the Ordnance Survey Act 1841, important though they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The debate on health has moved on in the past year. It is symbolic that this Committee is a Tory-free zone because it was the Tories attitude to the health service that made them spectacularly unelectable across Scotland at the last election. The Government deserve credit for acting swiftly to abolish the disastrous internal market and to reverse many of the worst aspects of the national health service under the Tories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few will miss the dogma and the corrosive ethos of competition which undermined the foundations on which the NHS was built after the war. Nobody will miss general practice fundholding, which created a new class structure in the NHS as a two-tier service emerged. Few tears will be shed for the ludicrous arrangements for hospital contracting—with administrators and doctors scuttling round hospitals after one another all year, trying to sign contracts just in time for the process to start all over again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In section 1 of the White Paper, the Government restated the historic ideals of the health service as
	<br><q><p>"free at the point of use, funded through general taxation and available to all on the basis of need."</p></q>
It is surely an indictment of the Tories' legacy that there is a danger that we might have forgotten that. While the Government have begun to tackle the corrosion left behind by the Conservatives, a serious part of their legacy has barely been touched. I am sure that it pains the Minister greatly, but the issue of core funding in the NHS will not go away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier Grand Committee Question Time the Liberal Democrats were accused of being churlish when we dared to take issue with the announcement of extra cash for winter bed pressures. The Minister sought to correct me earlier and said that the Chancellor announced a £4.5 million budget. I think that it was £44.5 million. We would like to give them the credit for that. We are a sensitive lot and are deeply wounded when we are accused of being churlish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consistently supported such extra money as the Government have been able to find, particularly as during the election the plan was to keep within Tory spending limits. We are always getting our election pledges thrown back at us and that is one policy reversal, however modest, that we are quite keen to support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem remains that demands on the health service are such that piecemeal, crisis funding cannot begin to tackle the underlying difficulties it faces. I know that the Minister is unlikely to take my word for it but perhaps he will acknowledge the comments of one of new Labour's closest friends. Writing in his own newspaper two weeks ago the editor of 	<i>The Observer</i> highlighted the issue. He said:
	<br><q><p>"well directed reforms take place against a growing and unaddressed financial squeeze … the NHS needs three per cent. growth in spending in real terms just to stand still … The truth is that the NHS is in a profound and intensifying crisis."</p></q>
Those are Will Hutton's words not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, the Government have put more money into the NHS but they have not yet begun to get to grips with the "profound and intensifying crisis". If the Minister seriously believes that the extra cash he has wrung from the Treasury is adequate, maybe he can answer a few simple questions. Why have the Labour Government continued the discredited Tory practice of staging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
nurses pay awards with the pay review body's award of 3.8 per cent. consequently reduced in value to 2.6 per cent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why in its 1997 report did the Institute for Employment Studies find that a third of nurses in Scotland fear that they may be made redundant? Is that why only one in four nurses would recommend nursing as a career? What future is there for the NHS when investment in medical equipment is now almost ancient folklore rather than current practice? The situation is just not sustainable and we will wait to see exactly how much of the waiting lists money announced recently does not disappear down the deficit drain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Creative political thought is, of course, going into finding ways of providing the investment needed for the NHS in the 21st century. Under the Tories we had the private finance initiative. That has now been rebranded as public-private partnerships. The Minister was right to be sceptical about the suitability of PFI for the health service although he has been partial in his scepticism. The PFI was unsuitable for the Western General in Edinburgh but it is fine for the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Why is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There need be no ideological hang-ups about private finance being invested alongside taxpayers' money in public sector projects. The world would be a simpler place if the Treasury would just lighten up about public money being used legitimately for investment in bricks and mortar, and other things besides. However, there are genuine concerns about the constraints which the PFI may place on hospitals and the public purse. The PFI contracts are for the long term and the parties are being asked to sign up to contracts over a 25-year period. How can anyone know what the nature of provision will be in 10 years' time, never mind in 25 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Royal infirmary the British Medical Association is already sceptical about the assumptions for current health delivery built into the PFI plans. Who will be in control? While the clinical services will remain the preserve of the NHS, the facilities management and other services will be in private hands. Will other hospitals in Lothian and the Borders be forced to adapt the referral patterns and activity to suit the contracted levels at the new royal infirmary? A huge slug of money being pre-committed 25 years ahead will be unavailable for spending elsewhere. Many questions about the PFI remain unanswered. Perhaps the Minister will answer them today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is no serious prospect of the Treasury recognising the Scottish national health service's investment needs, a much more honest debate about rationing will be necessary. It is a concept which all Governments are reluctant to discuss in polite company. But in a world of deficits and underfunding the subject cannot be ducked, although the White Paper has had a go. It states:
	<br><q><p>"It is sometimes argued that the NHS cannot cope with the pressures it now faces and the challenges posed by the pace of change. The Government reject that view."</p></q>
So that is that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The White Paper introduces the idea of capping general practitioners' drugs budgets. The Scottish Office is re-examining the Scottish health authorities revenue equalisation formula as it tries to introduce a new basis for re-allocating funding for Scotland. Many parts of rural Scotland fear that there is a simple way of re-allocating a capped budget m favour of the cities. With growing demand for new technologies, an aging population, and inconsistency in treatment throughout the country an increasing feature of the NHS in Scotland, who will own up to the reality of rationing in the service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper goes in greater detail into plans for re-organising the NHS. The Liberal Democrats are supportive of the abolition of the internal market. A new ethos of partnership is upon us and it deserves to succeed. Apparently trust chairmen are already being invited to attend health board meetings. But there are still some grounds for nervousness. Will the people who were appointed secretly by the previous regime without any accountability or openness simply be reshuffled and given new tasks? Can the broad sweep of individuals who presided over the in-fighting of the internal market be relied upon to introduce the new user-friendly patient-driven NHS? Old instincts die hard. An announcement that the Minister intends to institute an open basis for the appointment of trustees and executive directors would be welcome reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the trusts will differ greatly from existing bodies. Will outside candidates be allowed to apply for the new posts, or will the names of only a cadre of approved candidates for local selection go forward from the management executive? That point is important. Local communities must be ably to feel that they have some influence over the new NHS arrangements, otherwise the new regime will be seen as remote and out of touch as the old one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health boards have embarked on a consultation exercise to test local opinion on the future shape of local health services. Consultation is welcome, but is it for real? In Fife, Lord Ewing has already given his view of the single option under consideration there. In the Lothians, only one and a half choices have been offered. In the Borders, the consultation paper proposes only one option—to rejig the current two trusts. In the past, I supported the two-trust structure. But there has been vigorous debate about it in the Borders. Not everyone is convinced that a two-trust format is the sensible way forward but no alternative is being offered. Without those options, does a public debate have meaning? What chance is there for an alternative view to prevail? Those questions arise—despite what the Minister has said—even before the chief medical officer has concluded his acute services review. Surely the shape of the NHS, in both management and other terms, must take account of the way in which services will be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still much scepticism about the running of the NHS. It is vital that the staff, and users, of the NHS do not regard consultation as merely a matter of going through the motions. If they do, the new start for the NHS will be dead on arrival. That should not happen. There is much to commend in the White Paper. The Green Paper allows for serious debate about improving

health care in Scotland. But people must believe in the changes and in the future of the NHS, and until they know who will run it and where the money will come from, the jury is still out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.59 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Pentlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to speak in the debate, which I want to extend to discuss the special needs of old people. That is not a coded reference to constitutional change in the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Old people, especially those who are frail and vulnerable, are dependent upon the national health service. They were led to expect that the health service would take care of them in ill health until their death, but in some respects, because of poor co-ordination and lack of planning, the NHS fails old people. Resources are sometimes wasted because of structural divisions and funding problems between sectors, such as the acute hospitals sector, primary care and community care. There is a lack of research and of proper costing. More must be done to ensure that best practice is promoted across Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is considering these issues, and I welcome the White Paper, which is an important first step in designing a service from the patient's viewpoint to deliver high-quality, clinically effective care, quickly and reliably, in the most appropriate setting. Unfortunately, that does not work for some old people. I shall give an example of the way in which some patients at present are not receiving the kind of service that the Minister would want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall highlight three areas: first, admission to hospital, secondly, length of stay and, thirdly, discharge. First, a recent study of emergency and medical admissions in Lothian, showed that 35 per cent. of those admitted were over 65 years old. The same study showed that concerns about diagnostic uncertainty and patient dependency were a material factor in general practitioners' decisions to seek patients' admission to hospital. Another important influence on the admission decision was the patient's poor domestic and social circumstances. Old people should not have to suffer the upset of admission to hospital because of the lack of alternative diagnostic and support facilities in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Procedures need to be set up to advise and support GPs to discourage them from seeking admission to an acute bed merely for want of expert advice or better community alternatives. There are alternatives, which I hope discussion about the White Paper will encourage. I want one-stop diagnostic day centres, improvements in communication links between GPs, experts and hospitals, and centres in the community that can provide emergency back-up care, such as overnight nursing, to help to keep patients at home in appropriate circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad, but it is sometimes easier for a person to make contact with a local vet about a dog than it is for a GP to make contact with an expert geriatrician for necessary advice about the state of an old person's health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is the length of stay. Once older people are admitted to acute care in hospitals, it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
unacceptable that they should be left there for weeks because of staff constraints on assessment, or the lack of alternative funding for home disability aid or care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of providing a hoist, or some other adaptation in the home, is far less than the cost of a hospital bed. The issue of funding services for people who in the past might have received hospital care, needs to be addressed. I look forward to the report on the issue of the royal commission, chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland, which, as the Minister knows, is of great concern to many old people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue is discharge. We must consider the provision of post-acute care and develop and evaluate a strategy across the country. I commend to the Minister the early supported discharge scheme for elderly trauma patients, which has been developed by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh trust. That has worked well in the Princess Margaret Rose hospital in my constituency, where I hold my surgery. It shows that with proper planning and organisation, the length of stay in acute care can be reduced, with successful rehabilitation at home. It has proved popular with patients and their families; readmission rates have been low and savings in the acute sector have outweighed modest resources implications for community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very good work is being done in Lothian on these issues and I commend to the Minister a recent report of a working group, chaired by Colin Currie and Janet Kells. Interesting and valuable work is being done throughout Scotland on many of these matters and I invite the Minister to give priority to old people, to draw together existing research work and to give new direction to initiatives in the health service that will ensure that the national health service provides an even better service for old people, based on equity, need and compassion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind that so many old people end up in nursing homes, I draw the Minister's attention to the need for reform of the legislative structure that regulates nursing homes. Legislation in Scotland is based on the Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act 1938 and the scheme is far out of date. The legislation was never designed to deal with the present situation and I ask the Minister to consider a fundamental review of the legislative scheme that governs the inspection, control and registration of nursing homes, and early reform of it. I commend him for all the hard work which is shown in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I welcome the two papers—one green and one white—published by the Scottish Office. I am sure that there is no political or football bias in those documents, which provide a sound basis for discussion of the future of the health service in Scotland. I welcome, too, the additional Government expenditure on the national health service in Scotland and the fact that the Minister is a highly regarded and well-respected member of the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
medical profession, who has a deep knowledge of the health service. Those are positive aspects that we can take forward from the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service affects all our lives. Members of the Committee could talk about their own benefits from the health service, or those of their families, and their indebtedness to it. The issue is regularly raised by our constituents because it is a fundamental part of society in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that today's debate will be constructive, and that the listening process and consultation by the Government will be genuine because nothing has yet been cemented into place. Under the previous Government, any consultation process was often seen as a false exercise because decisions had already been taken before consultation took place. Changes under the previous Government caused great confusion, concern and even turmoil within the national health service. I hope that that will not happen now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that many hon. Members want to speak in the debate, but I genuinely seek knowledge from the Minister. The health board funding is apparently to be divided between acute and primary care trusts, a matter that I raised in an intervention earlier, when the Minister kindly said that there was no blueprint and that variations could be adapted to suit local needs. That is important. We must acknowledge Scotland's demography and geography and not impose one pattern on every part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider the combination of health and social services and how the integration of primary, secondary and social care services can be achieved in coterminous areas. That is fundamental to all of us. I use my own constituency as an example, but other hon. Members will perhaps advance similar arguments in respects of their constituencies. In Moray, we are particularly proud of the fact that we argued and won, on a cross-party basis across the community, the case for enhanced provision at Dr. Gray's in Elgin. We want a combined trust to continue in Moray. Substantial and comprehensive consultation has been undertaken across the board. Public meetings have been held and members of the public have been involved. Consultants, general practitioners, nurses, ancillary workers—everyone involved in providing the relevant service in Moray—has taken part. Those people have clearly argued that there is strong public and professional support for an integrated service. If the Minister has not yet received the relevant report, I should be happy to forward a copy to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that no blueprint existed. Moray is an area that often seems to feel the pull of different directions; part of the constituency looks to the west and Inverness, and part looks to the east and Aberdeen. We have fought hard to establish good health service provision in Elgin and our case should certainly be listened to. The documentation shows that the health board has confirmed that there would be no transitional cost; neither would there be any great transfer of jobs to a primary care trust base in Elgin. There would be seven local health care co-operatives, six of which would be outwith Moray. The hon. Member for Gordon
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
(Mr. Bruce) may know that Inverurie is being considered as another option. That would mean, to the people in Moray district, the centralisation of everything on Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues that I have raised need careful consideration. I am sure that they will be considered by other hon. Members, as they pertain to their areas. The important issue of how to divide primary care trusts and acute trusts should be considered in the light of geography and demographic patterns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I, and many other hon. Members, had the opportunity to meet representatives of the Scottish Association for Mental Health and the Law Society of Scotland to discuss the possibility of introducing an incapable adults Bill in Scotland. That would be an important Bill; such a measure is dealt with in a Scottish Law Commission report—No. 151. Such provision would do much to resolve quickly and easily some of the legal problems affecting people suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease or other mental disease. I do not think that there is cross-party dispute on the issue. Would the Minister approve of the inclusion of such a measure in the next Queen's Speech? Perhaps the matter could make progress, in the Scottish Grand Committee. It should be put on the statute book as soon as possible. I hear regularly about such legal problems in my surgeries. Yesterday I was speaking to a Christian fellowship in my constituency and that matter was raised. It affects many families and I hope for cross-party support for the measure, a draft of which is available from the Scottish Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of nurses is very important. I declare an interest, as I serve on the parliamentary panel of the Royal College of Nursing. I am always grateful for its work. It has drawn attention, in the context of the documents before the Committee, to the need for a senior nurse on every trust board. Those are the people who can bring knowledge of direct responsibility and its stresses into that forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vexed question of pay is the other matter that needs to be raised. A third of nurses in Scotland have said that they are worried that they may be made redundant. Many others are worried about the fact that so many trusts employ them on short-term contracts, which does not give them security of employment. The staging of the 3.8 per cent. pay award reduces its value to 2.6 per cent. and, as a result of the staging, an E-grade nurse will receive £274 less. I should like the Government to examine how each trust defines the grading of nurses, because it has a huge impact on their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is the Government's attitude to hospices. There has been substantial publicity in local newspapers about the arguments relating to Tor-na-Dee and Roxburghe house hospices in Aberdeen. These are complex arguments dealing with funding and staffing. The Government must examine the issues in depth because of their impact on the local community. The Minister well knows that I am involved in a campaign to develop hospice facilities in Moray. He has received the business project developed by the campaign group, and I hope that he will come to meet the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These issues affect many people. Hospice facilities are still relatively new in the service provided to my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
constituents and the public as a whole. This is an emotional sphere and we all want the best facilities in our area. I should like the Minister to comment on how he views Grampian health board's attitude, particularly to Roxburghe and the development of a hospice in Moray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is, perhaps, on a more sour note. I have tried hard to be constructive because I regard health as an important issue. The document issued by the Scottish Office Department of Health contains the application form for chairmen and non-executives of trusts. It is an interesting little document. I refer, in particular, to the part about political activity, which states:
	<br><q><p>"In the last five years, have you undertaken any political activity? (This means activities that are a matter of public record such as an office bearer, public speaking in support of, or candidature on behalf of any political party (or affiliated body) which fields candidates at local or general elections in any part of the UK or in Elections to the European Parliament)."</p></q>
It continues:
	<br><q><p>"If 'YES', please give the following additional information: Political Party, Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Other".</p></q>
I am not sure if that is as a result of the increase in the opinion poll ratings of my political party, but I point out that the document was published in February 1998. Perhaps the newly appointed spin doctors at the Scottish Office could devise a new questionnaire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I thank hon. Members from both sides of the Committee for all their kind wishes during my recent illness, which were most appreciated. I received more than 500 cards and letters and many phone calls. There are those who think that such things do not matter, but when one is on the receiving end of them, believe me, they do. I was very pleased by hon. Members' support and kind wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to talk about my experience and, I hope, give a message to those who are either going through what I went through or recovering from it. I attended a function in Kilmarnock to commemorate the service of our friend Willy McKelvey, who was the Member of Parliament for the region for many years. I pay especial tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne). He, his colleagues and his local friends and party workers offered their support to my family at a very important time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I describe myself as being the reverse of anorexic. When somebody is anorexic, he or she looks in the mirror and imagines that he or she is putting on weight and getting fat. I knew that I was putting on weight, but I did not know that I was putting on as much weight as I was or that I was as fat as I was. I have become a bore because I keep lecturing people about not doing as I do. Politicians tend to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I woke up with a pain in my chest that I had not felt before. It was not a piercing or hurting pain, but it was uncomfortable. I knew that something was wrong. I moved from one side to the other, and the pain did not go away. I wondered whether to phone for assistance. This happened in the wee hours of the morning. I was in an hotel in Kilmarnock, where I was staying overnight
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
because I was attending the function. I dialled reception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many times have people had to call reception at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning, and found that nobody was there? To my benefit, Ken Quigley was manning his post. He took my call. I was trying not to panic. He was panicking as much as me. I told him that I thought that I was having a heart attack. He phoned immediately for a doctor and for the emergency services. Within 10 minutes of feeling the pain, I was being attended to in the hotel foyer by a local GP. Within 15 minutes of receiving that attention, I was in the casualty department of the Crosshouse hospital in Kilmarnock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two things saved my life—first, the speed at which I was put into the excellent hands of staff, doctors and support units in the hospital, and, secondly, the fact that I did not smoke—I wished to make that point. I pay tribute to the doctor who put the aspirin under my tongue when I was lying on the floor, and who gave me a morphine injection. He was Dr. Ian Richard, who came to me within 10 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Believe it or not, I have lost almost 701b of weight in three months. I am still quite a stout chap, but I have lost five stone. I shudder when I look at photographs of me taken in November. I should like to give a message to the public and to MPs. MPs' lifestyle is not good enough to enable us to live a fulfilling life. There is not one member of the Committee, of any party, who works fewer than 15 hours a day and not many of us work fewer than seven days a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have learned anything from my experience, it is that I shall prioritise my life a wee bit better. I genuinely give this advice to my colleagues. Prioritising will make us better politicians. We should not run about as we tend to, when we can delegate to other Departments or even to colleagues in local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, for heaven's sake, we should have a wee bit of time for our families. That is so important. Is it any wonder that more than 50 per cent. of politicians' relationships end in divorce? Has anybody looked at how many MPs die in service from heart attacks and so on? That is my message to colleagues—change your lifestyle. I have not lost weight by drinking carrot juice and by doing daft things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is my message to people who know, as I did, that they are a wee bit overweight but are always going to do something about it next week or next month. Change your lifestyle and eat to feed, do not eat to eat. Work to live, do not live to work. Those are the buzz words or the spin that will put on the message with no assistance from elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a further message. I spent two and a half weeks on a cardiac unit that was full of Mr. Averages. They looked fit and seemed the ideal weight, but they had been ignoring the signs. They were either smoking too much, their cholesterol was too high or they were eating too much fat. It is not just the big guys like me who have heart attacks. The Mr. and Mrs. Averages have heart attacks, too.

I am thankful for the Scottish national health service. It was there for me when I needed it and it saved my life. I applaud the Government's changes, including getting rid of the internal market and providing more funding to get waiting lists down. Further

Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood). I am sure that careful heed will be paid to his powerful recommendations, even by the likes of me, who are positively anorexic. My fighting weight is nine stone six pounds, but there is still room for improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Minister mention poverty. It is the first time that I have attended a health debate in which a Minister laid proper stress on and gave due account to the importance of poverty in the delivery of health services. I would like to think that Scottish Office Ministers will use every device available to take advantage of the schemes that the Government have brought forward. The Minister is in a good position to do that, because he has had experience from within the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social exclusion unit is doing important work from Downing street. It has a sister operation north of the border, of which Lord Sewel is in charge. There is more important work to be done there. I hope that the Minister will ensure that he and his colleagues work with the grain to try to solve some of the urgent problems that the social exclusion unit is considering. It does not have much money, although a UK-wide small sum of £50 million was recently announced in the Budget to help communities facing social exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent increase in the number of single homeless people north of the border, shown in figures that were released late last month, is of great concern. It is the start of a trend, although I do not know whether it is due to the Child Support Agency or the breakdown of marriage. I do not know the current age profile of single homeless households, but it is becoming a problem that will have an impact on the resources that are available to the health service if it is not dealt with at source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister has discussions through the exclusion unit with Ministers responsible for other parts of the United Kingdom about setting targets. Some interesting targets were set by the recent welfare Green Paper. I know that it is not easy, but I do not understand why the Government do not seek to establish a minimum adequate income against which household incomes north of the border could be measured. That would give us a positive advantage in public discussions. It would be a brave but difficult thing to do, and enormously helpful in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister also knows that Age Concern is running a take-up week from 3 to 9 April to encourage people, especially retired pensioners, to take up more of the benefit to which they are entitled. The Government have introduced 50 pilot projects. I do not know how many of those are in Scotland; I hope that some of them are. The DSS income-related benefit statistics estimated take-up in the year 1995 to 1996. They showed that over a million pensioners were not claiming and that the sum involved was as much as £1.7 billion. It would make a considerable difference to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
health budget throughout the United Kingdom if some of those funds were released. I accept that the Government are dealing with those matters, and I hope that the Minister will assist in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point about poverty relates to the Social Security Acts of 1986 and 1988, which abolished supplementary benefit and brought in income support. A number of changes were made. One was that water and sewerage charges were removed from income support payments. In the old system, supplementary benefit included an amount for water and sewerage; income support does not do so. There is evidence that the increased water and sewerage charges have become a real problem, especially for low income households. That results in poverty and has an adverse impact on health. I urge the Minister to consult his colleagues in other Departments, north and south of the border, on those matters. That could produce a positive outcome for the health service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the Minister said about the Government's position on waiting lists. In south-east Scotland, the waiting lists are not bad, although I was told that there is nearly a year's wait for rheumatology operations. That is a long time, especially as the procedures can give great relief to people with bad hips and so on. Having discussed these matters with the Royal College of Nursing and other health professionals north of the border, I am anxious that the Minister should not drive the agenda to the extent that he removes discretion from local people and forces them to take daft decisions. It will be counter-productive if people with non-urgent conditions are taken off waiting lists and, as the hon. Member for Clydesdale said, if the health of people in the acute and emergency sectors is prejudiced because our paramount attention is given to waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the drive to reduce waiting lists. That is right and proper. However, the Minister should take care. If that drive is taken to extremes, discretion will be removed from local people, who are often in a better position to make judgments at the margins about those important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reinforce what has been said about the importance of community hospitals in the delivery of care in a country that has such a large landward and rural area. Community hospitals are under threat—now, more than ever—because of capital allowances and the returns that health authorities now have to make on their heritable assets. I understand why that provision was introduced, but it means that health authorities like those in the borders, which have much heritable property because they deliver health care over a disparate area, find it harder and harder to meet such charges. Has the Minister any reassurances for the Committee about community hospitals? I should say in passing that if the Minister has any good news for me about the start date for Hawick community hospital, I shall throw my hat in the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a few points about the nursing profession. The role of health visitors is often underestimated. They are highly dedicated professionals, and can do far more good, preventive work in the community than members of any other sector of the health service, bar none. I hope that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
Minister will support the development of the service that they deliver with such enthusiasm and skill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nursing and midwifery practice development unit has been on the Government's agenda for a long time. What is happening with regard to that matter? The sooner we have an announcement, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening to nurse prescribing? Many savings could be made giving nurses controlled access to prescribing in certain circumstances. That would release doctors and help them enormously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said about the need for a measure to deal with incapable adults. The hon. Lady has already committed her parliamentary group to the project, and I can tell her that we will give the Government every assistance and support in bringing forward such a measure. The Secretary of State looked "hodden doon" when I mentioned that. I know and understand that his responsibilities are not light and that he has one or two other matters on his plate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee could deal with the Second Reading and Committee stages of the proposed draft Bill, which is quite large. It has no cost implications, either, which should cheer up the Secretary of State. Another Scottish Bill is being introduced next year, so a couple of clauses could be attached to that. It would have all-party support. No member of the Committee would stand in its way, though that does not mean that it would not require careful scrutiny. With fair wind, it could be speeded through without any let or hindrance. If that happened, the rights of mental health patients north of the border could be transformed.

As I say, the proposed Bill would have support from both sides of the Committee. It would deal with legislation dating back centuries. It is now clear that the health care of people with dementia or learning difficulties is being prejudiced because their individual concerns are not being taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Government are making progress and I hope that the Minister will fight his corner in the departmental spending review. We exchanged arguments earlier over the requisite level of finances. I hope that the Government will commit themselves to winning more resources for the health service. We shall support them in what they do but much more remains to be done. The service needs more money and it should be spent in the best possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend both Front-Bench spokesmen on being disciplined in sticking to a quarter of an hour for their speeches—a new and welcome precedent in the Scottish Grand Committee. However, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will find time when he replies to deal with some of the important points that have been raised. One crucial issue, about which he knows a great deal, is the future of St. John's hospital in Livingston. The situation there has consequences that go beyond West Lothian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
When the hospital was built, the expectation was that the new town would be substantially larger than it turned out to be. There are around 300 surplus beds, a problem which has consequences in Edinburgh. As mentioned by the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman, there are one and a half solutions about what might be done to solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on the most likely decision and, in particular, clarify whether the Scottish Office regards it as proper to send a senior representative to one or two public meetings to be held in the area in order to deal with the problem. That would enable a Scottish Office view to emerge on what is best not only for West Lothian but for Edinburgh and, in particular, for people living in the west Edinburgh corridor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know the Scottish Office view on Trevor Jones's stated public position that, in certain circumstances, St. John's could become a teaching hospital, together with Western general and the new Royal infirmary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not news to the Minister that, outside Edinburgh, there is considerable suspicion that, as the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale said, the new Royal infirmary will gobble up funds for the next quarter of a century. I do not share that suspicion, and I do not bear ill will towards, or feel jealous of, the Royal infirmary. But many serious people in West Lothian are worried about the future of St. John's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Scottish Office view that St. John's could cooperate with Western general and the Royal infirmary as part of a teaching hospital organisation would have great attraction. I am worried that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs provided a different view. Perhaps that reflects the different views that exist among consultants, trade unions that represent hospital staff, and general practitioners. I would be grateful if the Minister could say something about the matter this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction in trusts has led several vulnerable people to worry about severance terms if they lose their jobs through amalgamation, and about being cajoled, if not forced, into premature retirement. I should welcome comments on what will happen, as a result of the administrative changes that my hon. Friend described, to those in vulnerable positions who have served the NHS well and honourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) may refer to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Green Paper, which provides a helpful if frightening catalogue of the steps that must be taken outside the immediate remit of the NHS to improve Scotland's health. The hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) referred to an aspect that I would also like to highlight. Faster action must be taken to impose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
restrictions on the tobacco firms that are responsible for so much misery in Scotland today. The Green Paper includes figures for school children who smoke. The figures show that we are hardly winning the battle for young boys, and that we are losing the battle for young girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper identifies another major factor in Scotland's health: the state of housing, which contributes to so much ill health. It is disappointing that £479 million less will be spent on housing in 1997-99 than was spent in the two previous years. There is no point in spending more money on primary health care while reducing the amount of money for tackling one of the root causes of poor health in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper refers to the composition of the health boards and states that existing health boards and their membership structure should be retained but with stronger community representation. The previous Government were often quite rightly accused of putting their cronies on the health boards. I realise that we can never accuse the current Secretary of State of being partial to cronyism but I should like some more detail from the Minister about how the members of the new health boards are chosen. In particular, will local authorities have representation as of right? It is important that local authorities have a more direct input into the health boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Criticism of GP fundholding was largely based on the fact that it set up a two-tier system of the haves and have nots within general practice. It seems from reading the White Paper that the introduction of the local health care co-operatives will mean that four types of system will be available throughout Scotland. There will be local health care co-operatives that have a budget and others which ought not to have a budget. There will be GPs who are not in their local health care co-operative and former fund-holding GPs who will continue to have a budget on a transitional basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the White Paper, the benefits of local health care co-operatives with a budget are that practices will be able to provide a wider range of services for their patients and will have access to specialist support, such as public health promotion and so on. What does that tell us about local health care cooperatives that do not have a budget? How will patients who are treated by GPs who ought not to join the cooperative get the same standard of service that the new local health care co-operatives will be able to offer? It is important that people in Scotland should have the same standard of service, regardless of the predilections of their GPs, who for personal reasons or animosities may decide to join or not to join a particular co-operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he does not want to solve the waiting list problem by throwing money at it. We were lucky to get off so lightly this year because of the very mild winter but I think the Minister would recognise that there are many problems that can be solved only by putting in more resources. If I can be parochial for a minute I should like to raise a constituency case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The population of the village of Southerness on the Solway coast grows substantially in the summer because it is a popular holiday resort. The target for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
ambulance turnout in sparsely populated areas is 21 minutes. Southerness is at least 20 minutes drive from the nearest ambulance station. It will not surprise anyone to hear that none of the last 23 emergency calls in the Southerness area were answered within the target time. There is also concern about ambulance services in central Scotland and in Glasgow. Only existing resources can solve the problem. The resiting of ambulance stations needs to be considered as no amount of taking out management tiers or rejigging the service will cut the time it takes a vehicle to drive from A to B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that specialist provision can often only be provided in centres of excellence which by their nature tend not to be in rural areas. But there is a significant problem for people in rural areas who either have to travel for treatment or visit relatives. That is an important part of the convalescent process. Will assistance for patients or relatives to travel be considered? If we increase the concentration in certain areas for patients who are going to stay overnight, we need to offer some other compensation for people who have to travel to get that treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, much of the last five years has been spent arguing about how much has or has not been spent on the NHS. Election campaigns in particular seem to degenerate into batteries of statistics being flung from one side of the Chamber to the other, or from one television screen to another, seldom to the enlightenment of listeners. The success of the Government's programme will be judged by whether all the health indicators in Scotland have been improved, not simply by whether more money has been spent on one measure than on another. There is vast scope for improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming the opening speech of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and the Government's commitment to the national health service—a commitment clearly demonstrated by the increase in expenditure, the attack on bureaucracy and the promise to reduce waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome especially the White Paper's stated objective of delivering a health service designed for patients, which will provide better services for them in a manner that is responsive to their needs. That is in marked contrast to the previous Government's approach, which promoted the market economy and, as the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said, conducted often false exercises in consultation. All of us want a national health service that puts patients first, listens to their view and does not formulate policy on the basis of competition. We want a health service that determines the provision of services not in the interests of a few but for the needs of the many. It must be open and accountable, and treat patients and staff with dignity and respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members know that the morale of health service staff hit rock bottom under the Conservatives. We must do all that we can to ensure that staff in all grades feel valued and respected, be they consultants or cleaners. We must never forget that for all the excellence of medical and nursing staff, the NHS would not run without the contribution of support staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
I will touch on four aspects of the White Paper: responsiveness to the needs and perspectives of patients, openness, patient involvement and information. First, I join those hon. Members who have urged the Government to give urgent priority to legislation to deal with incapable adults. Any health service policy, especially in relation to mental health problems—which can be caused by dementia, head injuries, accidents and other disabilities—should not forget Scotland's 700,000 carers, without whom our national health service would be sorely stretched. A consortium of organisations and lobby groups is calling for legislation that would benefit greatly not only adults who suffer from some form of dementia or other mental illness but their carers as well. They may have been caring for sick people for months, perhaps years. I hope that we shall be able to find space in our future legislative timetable for such a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point, which touches on community care, is about openness and accountability. I am still concerned about the inaccessibility to the public of some of the inspection reports on residential homes, and nursing homes in particular. I fully support the comments made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Dr. Clark) and her call for a revision of the legislation on nursing homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, as a Member, of trying to obtain copies of inspection reports on nursing homes, I have found the health board reluctant to make the reports easily accessible. It has, of course, pointed out that one can visit a home and read a report while one is there, but I find that unacceptable. We are dealing with families who have been caring for a loved one for years and who have come to the difficult and traumatic decision that that person requires full-time long-term care. Yet those families are unable easily to gain access to reports on nursing or residential homes, sit and read them at length and debate the pros and cons of the different homes. Instead, they are expected to go to a particular home and have the owner hovering around them while they try to take in the contents of the report. I understand that it is for health boards and councils to determine how these reports are to be made accessible, but I ask the Minister to consider putting more pressure on them to make the reports more accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point, which also relates to community care, concerns the view that seems to prevail among some people that it is possible to replace all long-term care previously provided by the NHS with residential and nursing home care in the independent sector. Lynebank hospital in my constituency has, to my knowledge, at least 40 patients who are described as having forensic and dual diagnosis and require specialist nursing care 24 hours a day. Some have to be restricted in their ability to leave the hospital. I am not convinced that such patients can easily be discharged into the community or allowed to go into a residential or private nursing home for suitable health and nursing care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to deal with patient involvement, which is highlighted in the White Paper. The Government's commitment to greater patient involvement and information will be of particular interest to the more than 50 families who have contacted me about their experiences at Forth park
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
hospital. I am delighted to congratulate, as other hon. Members have done, the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) on becoming a grandfather, and to join him in praising the vast majority of the care provided by the nurses, midwives and other staff at Forth park hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried, as have the families, to make it clear that the criticism is directed not at the majority of those staff, but at a handful of senior clinicians and managers. As anybody who has tried to question one of the most powerful closed shops in the land will know, consultants sometimes object to that questioning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to the comments of my hon. Friend. I reassure him that, like many other hon. Members, I think that the vast majority of consultants are wonderful people. There are a few, however, whose handling of patients, of the public and especially of people in a traumatised and vulnerable state, leaves a great deal to be desired. I was very pleased to note the commitment in the White Paper to review the NHS complaints procedure, to ensure that clinicians are able to communicate with patients and their relatives and to encourage professional training in relevant communication skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Families are awaiting—as I am—the report from the independent review panel that was set up to investigate their complaints about the lack of medical intervention at Forth park. The families were very disappointed that they were not given direct access to the independent panel and that they were expected to try to put down on paper their experiences of the death of baby or of a baby born with a disability. They have never had the chance to have even 10 or 15 minutes to try to get across some of the trauma that they experienced, or some of their concern about the way in which they were dealt with when they started to query and to question what had happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper also refers to the planning and delivery of services as designed from the perspective of patients. I am sure that the Minister will not be surprised when I say that that will be welcome to the people of Dunfermline and west Fyfe. They feel that their views have been ignored by the health board and by the previous Government—especially their demand for local maternity services to remain in Dunfermline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak better than some of the children from Commercial primary school in Dunfermline who have recently written to me about the issue. I shall briefly read out two of their letters. The first one states:
	<br><q><p>"Dear Ms R. Squire,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>As a primary 7 doing a project on Living and Growing, I am very concerned about the lack of a maternity unit in Dunfermline. Our class has been studying the life of a baby and I now know what happens when a baby is born.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>If it is a cold and icy night and someone is driving from Abedour they might crash or if the lady gives birth in the car and it is a problem birth the results could be tragic. These are problems to do with the birth but there could be other children at home. They need to be cared for. Money might not be plentiful and the problems of child care and visiting could be enormous.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Anyway, why can't the paediatricians travel to Dunfermline? When I'm older the tax I pay will help keep them working. With Hyundai and other businesses moving into Dunfermline, we deserve our own maternity unit".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0877">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
That letter is from a young lady called Anne Kendall. I shall also briefly quote from another letter, from Lauren Gibson, who is also in primary year seven, and who is also studying living and growing. She wrote:
	<br><q><p>"There are other problems like traffic on the roads, bad weather and what if something went wrong and the baby died? It could have been saved. All because some people wouldn't open up the department which was already built in Dunfermline. How do you think the mother would feel? Also those people think 'Hey its only 20 minutes from Dunfermline'. Well that's bad enough but what about when you are talking about Oakley, Saline, Valleyfield, Blairhall and Crossford? Because the doctors are forgetting people have children in these villages. Its not just in towns people have babies you know. Also some people don't have transport or have other children to worry about. So please could you even just talk to someone to try and convince them to open a maternity ward in Dunfermline?"</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. ANDREW WELSH 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I rest my case on those words, which speak more eloquently than I could. I conclude by once again saying how delighted I am by the Government's clear demonstration of commitment to a national health service that is based on need and not ability to pay, and which will promote patient needs rather than competition and a market economy.</p>
	<p>12.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be taking part in this debate, which I think is the first on the Scottish health service of any kind since 26 February 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire), many of whose points I agree with, particularly about maternity services—I am still hoping for local maternity services back at the Western general in Edinburgh the inspection of nursing homes and public involvement in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), whom we are all delighted to see here back in action. I join him in paying tribute to the brilliant work that is done by doctors, nurses and support staff in the health service; I am sure that we all agree with what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has any lingering doubts about the wisdom of a Scottish Parliament need only reflect on the fact that we have had no health debate since February last year. That is exactly the way in which health and so many other Scottish affairs are dealt with at Westminster. Perhaps more than any other subject, the health service in Scotland will be transformed by the creation of a Scottish Parliament. Following the absence of a health discussion at Westminster or perhaps for other reasons, the Scottish media seem to pay very little attention to the health service; that has certainly been the case this morning in Committee. That is very unfortunate for the Government, because they have a good story to tell about the health service in their first year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been significant injections of money. I heard the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) complaining about the lack of money for the health service in Scotland, but for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
past two months the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have been telling us ad nauseam about the millions of extra pounds that need to be injected into Scottish local government. In some sense, both those positions may be correct, but the Liberal party will have to address itself to the political realities of Scottish life before it enters the Scottish Parliament and decides how it will prioritise in the spending decisions that it makes. Everybody wants to spend more money on everything, of course, but the Liberal party should acknowledge the significant extra money that has been and will be put into the health service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I become confused because there have been so many different sums. There will be about £150 million extra next year over the plans and this year we had £25 million extra for the winter beds crisis, which was thereby averted—with a little help from the weather. We have also had the money that was freed up from bureaucracy—£10 million and £100 million to come. Thus, there have been significant financial changes already. There is also the coming implementation of trust mergers, which was boldly announced before the election by the Secretary of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Robertson). That will also free up money from bureaucracy savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trust mergers and other policies are part of the new collaborative approach to the health service in Scotland. Once again, that has been broadly welcomed in Scotland. For example, there was the announcement earlier this year by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, who has just walked into the Room, of the new children's hospital at Aberdeen; that was a result of the new collaborative approach to the health service in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the new Government have already made significant achievements in the money that they have put in and the approach that they have adopted. Over and above that, there are the White and the Green Papers, which will transform the health service in Scotland in the near future. I shall not dwell on the White Paper—my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West has already said much about it with which I agree. However, there is an interesting debate still to be had about it. I have been comparing it with the English White Paper, and many interesting points will no doubt arise during discussions on NHS legislation in the next Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate on the Green Paper and the jigsaw on the front of it, which represents, more than any other image, the new approach to health adopted by the new Government. That jigsaw will transform the health debate in Scotland and provide the Scottish Parliament with its biggest challenge. I can tell those who have not seen the document that the jigsaw represents all the different strands of public policy that contribute to the health of the nation—not just health in the traditional sense, but encompassing housing, transport policy, diet and a range of other health-related factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that makes decisions about health even more difficult in the next year, especially for the Scottish Parliament which will have to take wider decisions about the most appropriate way to spend money on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
health. In a sense, all health decisions involve marginal analysis: if we spend more money on this, we forgo spending on that. We have to decide the best means of achieving maximum health gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we broaden the health debate to include damp housing, pollution, diet and so forth, decisions on spending are also broadened out and we have to decide whether the best way to spend money on health is to spend it on reducing waiting lists—clearly one priority—or on tackling damp housing. The hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nisdale (Mr. Morgan) raised that point, but was rather churlish in his interpretation of housing statistics: the reality is that housing expenditure has been increased significantly by the Government. He must take account of our starting point. Things will obviously be different in one year plucked out from the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parliament will face difficult decisions on health and may want to consider the example of the English health authority of Cornwall which decided to spend some of its health money on damp housing, particularly of asthmatics. It has already brought significant improvements to the health of people living in such houses. That is the sort of problem that the Scottish Parliament will have to confront. Waiting lists are a priority at the moment but in the longer term, it may not be the key issue. What matters is how long people wait and what they are waiting for. However, that does not detract from the Government's current priority of tackling waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the health projects in my constituency illustrate the broader health debate. In the Pilton area there is the Barri grub project—for the benefit of 	<i>Hansard,</i> that means good food—which seeks to promote healthy eating at an affordable price. Another health project has working groups dealing with poverty and ill health, and violence against women. There is also a stress centre in the Pilton area of my constituency, which treats mental health problems in a community setting. Such community initiatives point the way forward for the broader definition of health espoused by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have recently read two reports. One is by the Accounts Commission on acute mental health beds, suggesting that in some areas more money should be spent in the community—the opposite of what is sometimes said. The second is the report of the Scottish needs assessment programme on domestic violence, which highlighted the issue as an important health priority. I am sure that the Government will follow that up as a strategy emerges on how to deal with violence against women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the Government have redirected themselves correctly on health policy. Two issues remain. Concerns have been raised about the ongoing dispute in Edinburgh about the number of beds at the new Royal Infirmary. I have studied the issue and it is complicated, not least because of the dispute between the British Medical Association and Lothian Health about the categorisation of beds. What exactly is meant by the new category of acute elderly beds is in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once one has fought one's way through all the differences, there is still anxiety that the throughput figures for the new hospital are more ambitious than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
anything we have seen before. I want to believe that such a throughput is possible, because my prejudice is to put more money into primary care and, indeed, to have a primary-care centred national health service. I hope that Lothian health authority's figures are right, but I want the Minister to assure me that he has considered the matter carefully. Will he confirm that Lothian health authority has back-up plans if its bed figures prove over-ambitious?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second anxiety relates to cancer services, although I accept that in many respects Scotland has been a trailblazer in that regard. A report from the Accounts Commission on the treatment of ovarian cancer suggested that the excellent guidelines from CRAG—the clinical resource and audit group—are not always implemented. That leads to a more general question: how do we ensure that good guidelines are enforced? The White Paper for England mentions a commission for health improvement, which Scotland will not have. Will the Minister please tell us what are the alternative arrangements to ensure that the guidelines are implemented? The Accounts Commission report suggested that not all women with ovarian cancer were referred to the correct specialist and given the right follow-up treatment at multidisciplinary clinics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some excellent work has been done in relation to cancer, concern has been expressed, especially by the campaign with which I was associated—the Scottish Breast Cancer campaign—that money was earmarked for breast cancer in England but not in Scotland, although it is possible that the one-stop clinics that the Minister announced recently have dealt with the matter. I raise these concerns in the hope of an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general message is that after just one year in government, health has been transformed and will be further transformed because of the White Paper and Green Paper. The Government should be congratulated by members of the Committee; they may not be congratulated by the newspapers tomorrow morning, as most of them are not represented this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) for the incapable adults Bill. The fact that the measure is supported by both sides of the Committee should give the Scottish Office confidence in seeing the Bill through the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm) raised the important point that in the end the Scottish Parliament, which we all expect to see, will have a proper facility for debating matters related to the communities served by the Scottish Office, and that is to be welcomed. The Scottish Parliament will scrutinise in far greater detail what money is being spent where and how much it is really worth, taking into account inflation and what it is hoped will be achieved.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
There is a constant battle between the two sides of the House about exactly what is spent and where it is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are slipping dangerously into the previous Government's habit of introducing lumps of money into the conversation but trailing off when asked to say exactly what period of time is involved. Will the Minister confirm that the £100 million saving achieved by reorganisation is an annual saving?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those on the Government Benches fail to recognise the effect of high inflation on their figures. That is the crucial difference between the two sides of the Committee. It is what the money buys that counts in patient care, not the cash that is allocated. It is the outcome that is crucial in monitoring the future progress of the NHS. Hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), have expressed their anxiety that some measures can skew decision making; we are all aware that waiting lists are crucial and of great concern to the public, but we do not want matters that relate to the headline figures to be dealt with at the expense of other services that are valued by the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a hard juggling act to do, but they should remember that the people are behind them when it comes to preserving and improving the NHS. Reference is often made in the House to the detail of the manifesto, but most people who voted in the general election did not scrutinise every dotted i and crossed t in the manifestos; they considered impressions and messages. The message I received from the Labour manifesto was that it was our last chance to preserve and turn around a truly national health service. The Government should remember that the public are behind them on that. At times, they will be allowed to go beyond their manifesto commitments if it helps the health service and leads to improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Key local issues in the run-up to the election were methods of funding new hospitals and the risk of clinical care in Stonehaven hospital being managed for private profit. When the Minister visited Stonehaven—I saw him going up in a hoist to fix the last tile to the roof of the hospital—he said that he never wanted such a risk to be taken again. I welcome those comments, and I hope that my hon. Friend will confirm that, in any consideration of funding future hospital services, clinical management will remain in the NHS. I am sure that those are my hon. Friend's views; they should be on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of the health service is tied up with the Treasury's accounting rules on capital. I hope that the Minister is playing his part in trying to modernise the way in which the Treasury accounts for capital investment. It must be done carefully—we should not mortgage future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public health and the wider issues of poverty have been discussed today. One of the greatest advances in health was a clean water supply in every house, and an effective sewage system. My hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) pointed out that if the provision of water and sewage facilities, which is so crucial to public health, is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
removed from income support, something has gone wrong with this country's priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should ensure that other Departments understand the health implications of their decisions and priorities. The health service has plenty of work, and the health budget should not be squeezed to transfer money into other budgets unless that leads to a genuine improvement for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of community pharmacists in providing health care is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire championed the cause of pharmacies. There are anxieties about the recent settlement, the future of retail price maintenance and the effect of changes on the service. I hope that the Government are monitoring that to ascertain how the service can be protected. I am surprised that my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire failed to mention the threat to the pharmacy in St. Boswells. I am sure that that was simply an oversight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members whose constituencies border mine have expressed doubt about the future of hospitals that my constituents use, but are not based in my constituency. Anxiety has been expressed about Stracathro. Of immediate concern to my constituents are the City hospital, which Grampian health board is considering closing, Roxburghe house and Tor-na-Dee. Both Roxburghe house and Tor-na-Dee are in the constituency of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg). The trusts have formally requested consultation with the health board on the closure of Torna-Dee and the re-siting of Roxburghe house, which provides hospice support and palliative care. Tor-naDee is a complex case. The trust made the point that no other trust had a hospital like Torn-na-Dee. There are two ways of dealing with that—the management method of saying, "No one else has got one, so let's get rid of ours", or considering how the unique service could be used in the rest of Scotland, and ascertaining whether there is still a role for such a hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not be able to go into detail, but I should be interested to know what guidance or procedures the Government bring to bear when hospital closures reach the formal stage. After the three months of health board consultation, how would the matter be handled at ministerial level? What issues would be considered, and would there be guidance on how to treat them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to deal with those issues, because current patients and their relatives are not directly affected, but on the other hand, the questions that I have raised are relevant to a long-term debate on the future of the hospitals. Public debate is necessary and it is important to reassure current users that a service is available for them to use, while giving those members of the public who are worried about the future an opportunity for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps trusts move too quickly to the formal consultation phase, rather than involving the public at the informal stage of planning for the future, so that those for whose benefit the service is run will have taken part in the argument. Formal consultation usually takes the form of presenting a plan and asking for responses to it. Before that stage there may be a chance to influence thinking and approaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I should not mind knowing what general guidance the Scottish Office gives about the importance of convalescent care and whether it has a role in the health service and about how palliative care should be provided—on large campuses alongside major medical provision, or in a more secluded setting. I am also interested in the importance of relatives in helping patients cope with major illness. The hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) said that he was greatly helped by the cards and support he received. Clearly that would not be a medically measured effect, but relatives' response to a patient's treatment is important to the outcome. If they experience the hospital environment in a positive way, they are, I believe, more supportive of the patient. I should welcome the Government's views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bound up with what I have been discussing, but more complex, is the issue, first brought into play by the previous Government, of the boundary of care for the elderly. From the user's perspective, help with a health problem is what matters—not who is the provider or which budget is funding the help. I know that the Accounts Commission is doing a study of stroke treatment all the way through the system from the time of the stroke to the return home. I should welcome the Government's recognition of the need to find out about such matters. I note that both the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) and the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Dr. Clark) raised the issue of care of the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly surprised when I raised with the health board the question of its being an inopportune moment to take major decisions about closing hospitals or embarking on major reorganisation, if the entire trust system is up for reorganisation. The reply was that trusts are concerned with management and hospital closures are clinical matters. I cannot help feeling that anyone who is trying to manage a system is concerned with all the available assets. It seems odd to create an argument in which the incoming management would be able to make better use of the assets, but those no longer exist. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West said that the Government are committed to trying to increase the openness and accountability of trusts and their management. Something that needs to be communicated to trusts is that the word "trust" expresses a crucial feature of their role. They hold their assets in trust for the whole community—current and future patients and their relatives. I hope that they can be brought to appreciate their status as custodians, not owners. The Government should reinforce the message that they need to earn people's trust; it is not inevitable that a community will give it. I should welcome the Minister's views on how he might persuade trusts work with the community and earn trust. A truly national health service must involve all the people of the nation that it is meant to serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a result of our generosity in limiting Front-Bench speeches, I have plenty of time to reply to the debate, which will be useful in view of the many comments that have been made. Everyone has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
been generous today, making comments with a lack of rancour and querulousness. I hope that that reflects the fact that, although we might not agree on everything, the basic structure is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is special pleading from hon. Members and I understand the pressures on hon. Members of Parliament from local hospitals. I have the same problems myself. However, I hope that hon. Members will appreciate that the Government wish to stand slightly back to study the issues in the broad context and to decide what is best in the long term for the delivery of care. We must remove ourselves from the considerable local pressures that we all experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood). He has obviously lost so much weight that he has disappeared. It was good to see him back after what I know was a difficult time. I hope that he will continue to lose some weight because if he does not, he will continue to look like a Wallace Arnold bus driver in that jacket that he wears. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for all his comments. We are all delighted to see him back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many points have been raised and I shall take them in turn, mixing them as we go along. The funding issue was raised by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore). He quoted Will Hutton's figure of 3 per cent. That is not the figure. In order to stand still, the figure rests somewhat between 1 and 2 per cent. Any dispute about that figure depends on how one assesses the demographic shift. That being the case, it is an increase in real terms. It is not simply set against inflation, corrected for the retail price index, but is a real-terms figure, set against normal expansion. This year, we shall provide extra money. We shall not be standing still, but we shall be making significant improvements within the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist challenging that figure. Does not the vast majority of NHS cash go in staff costs? How on earth are we expected to have a stand-still trend of between 1 and 2 per cent. without taking it out of staff wages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All those issues are taken into account in the additional costs. The hon. Gentleman wants me to spend much more on staff costs and therefore to have less for patient care. He will have to try to square that circle. The increase that is needed every year, allowing for inflation and new demographic trends, is somewhere between 1 and 2 per cent. It probably falls towards the bottom of 1 per cent., but if we say that it is 2 per cent., that is an increase in real terms. I also re-emphasise the £100 million to be provided over three years, beginning from 1 April. I hope that I have made that point clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned the PFI. If the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) researches previous speeches that I have made in the House, he will know of my unease about the PFI in the past when it was badly organised and run. Many problems made it unattractive. However, we have reformed the PFI process, which now makes it an attractive option for the health service. It is not mortgaging one's future. A mortgage or hire purchase results in one paying more over the term of the contract.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
The PFI, over the term of the contract—about 25 years—results in significant savings to the NHS and to the taxpayer of up to 20 per cent. It is much higher in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me knock on the head once and for all that somehow we are mortgaging the future. We are not. During the term of a contract, the PFI delivers significant savings to the health service. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is not applicable everywhere. He asked why we would use it for the Royal Infirmary, but not for the Western General. It was not financially sound to use it for the Western General, so we did not do so. Where it was financially sound, we did. We have studied other areas, in some of which we shall use the PFI. Others, such as the maternity unit and the plastic surgery unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, were not financially viable PFI projects and we stopped them. We have an automatic view about this issue: what is good for the health service goes forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister is saying. In making these decisions there must be an element of commercial confidentiality. Many of us find that difficult to deal with. There is genuine anxiety that eventually clinical services might be involved in the private finance initiative. Will the Minister tell the Committee exactly what is the definition of clinical services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should have no fear that clinical services will ever be involved in PFI under a Labour Government. We gave that commitment, and I repeated it when I was in Stonehaven, balancing on the scaffolding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked for a definition of clinical services. We provided that by simply listing the services and drawing a line, with clinical services on one side of it. It is what the hon. Lady would expect, even to the extent of including secretarial and other management costs. If she wishes, I will send her a copy of the list, but I can give an absolute commitment that clinical services will never be involved in the PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were some questions about the bed numbers in the Royal infirmary. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm), I am somewhat confused about this subject. I will say that bed numbers are not, in any sense, a rocket science. Predictions about them are always difficult. I know, to my cost, that such numbers can vary. All that we can give is the best estimate at any particular time. The estimates for the number of beds at the Edinburgh Royal infirmary have nothing whatever to do with the PFI. I hear that rumour going around. Let me knock it on the head. The estimates are a clinical decision, although there is flexibility in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith is right to say that there are quite dramatic through-puts within the hospital. It is important, therefore, that there should be flexibility within the Lothian health board, not just within the PFI for the Edinburgh Royal infirmary, but for the services at the Western general and for those at the hospital in Livingston in the constituency of my right hon. Friend,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Cook).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not introduce PFI everywhere. We do so only when it is in the interest of the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear of the Liberal Democrat party's support for rationing. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Am I being querulous? It must be the first party to come out in favour of rationing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to avoid confusion, I should point out that earlier there was some muddle over numbers and over how much had been done this year. Liberal Democrat Members do not support rationing, but we believe that it is now a feature of the Scottish health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was being slightly mischievous. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has clarified the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any dicussion of rationing, it is important to distinguish between need and demand. Market or private systems, such as those in the USA, that are based on demand produce a bottomless pit and the question of rationing will then arise. That is not the same as a system based on needs. There are limits to needs and they can be satisfied. The Government intend to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of flexibility in Lothian, will the Minister write to me and to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to explain the Scottish Office view on flexibility in relation to St. John's and the consequences for the Royal infirmary and the Western general? Such a letter would be useful for public reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will certainly write to my hon. Friend. He also raised some issues about the teaching hospital at West Lothian. The nature of teaching hospitals has changed. Medical training is no longer concentrated in one hospital, partly because of the fall in bed numbers. The practice of all medical schools has been gradually to send their students out to different hospitals. Aberdeen sends them to Inverness; Glasgow sends them to Paisley, Greenock and all round Lanarkshire. That is a developing trend and hospitals such as St. John's in West Lothian will become part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some anxiety expressed about the Arbuthnot review and the Scottish health authorities review equalisation. The allocation to health boards is based on a formula set up under a previous Minister at the Scottish Office, the right hon. Bruce Millan. That formula sought to redistribute to ensure that money was moved around rather than concentrated in centres. That proved to be a beneficial practice for areas such as Ayrshire, where distribution was based on a formula guided by the needs of the services. That practice has been around since the later 1970s and it must now be time to review it. There is no hidden agenda so rural areas need have no fears. It is a purely objective scientific assessment which, for the first time, will take in rurality—which was not taken into account in previous years' allocations. We should all welcome an assurance about wider distribution.

The final point related to chairmen and the manner of their appointment to new trusts. Chairmen's jobs will be advertised, but, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman realises, the non-executive posts will not have to be advertised. As regards the chief executive and executive appointments, we tend to look first at those within. We are managing a health service whose staff have responsibilities such as families, mortgages, and so on. We think it right to consider them first. That does not necessarily mean that they will be placed in the same positions, but consideration will always be given to their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray mentioned consultation. I hope that we have been fairly open in developing this with a degree of partnership. I do not want consultation to become special pleading, to which we have all been subjected in the past. I appreciate that Members of Parliament face pressures locally and I hope that we can respond to that aspect, but we must take a slightly detached view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady and other hon. Members mentioned the Scottish Law Commission's paper No. 151 relating to incapable adults. The Government recognise the importance of that issue. We have consulted, and await the final results of consultation, after which we shall make known our views. We appreciate fully the need for legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about Moray hospice. I am awaiting the report of Grampian health board's review. As she knows, there is a conflict between bricks and mortar and producing a home in the community. I promise that, as soon as I hear the views of the health board, I shall arrange for her to see me, with representatives brought by her, to talk this matter through from her point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh Pentlands (Dr. Clark) talked to me about care of the elderly. This is an important subject. She highlighted the need to have services in the community, with better consultation, so as to have everything done on the same day. These things are priorities for the Government. The primary care trusts are designed specifically to provide as many diagnostic facilities as possible in the community. Edinburgh is well on the way to doing that, and having community centres. It is true that people do not want to go to hospital; they want things done in the community. That is what primary care trusts are about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend said that more information should be available. This, again, is a priority for the Government. By May this year every general practitioner's surgery will be linked to the NHS net. The following phase will ensure that surgeries are linked to hospitals and to all other facilities, so that by 2002 there will be complete interlinking of all information in Scotland. It will be confidential, so that all information can be sent back and forth. Laboratory results and X-ray results can be moved around. There will be no need to wait for bits of paper any more; everything will be delivered. We aim to introduce one-stop shops as far as possible. I have visited Dunfermline hospital in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) which already has one-stop-shop breast cancer clinics. A
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
woman with a lump is able to go there and on the same day be seen, X-rayed, have a biopsy, be given the result and be told about her future care plan. That must be the way forward for the health service. It will remove worry and the tension that goes with it. Our aim is to make that the norm in the health service. We have just announced an additional £3 million to push this forward in more and more clinics. That is one of our priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Pentlands also asked about legislation. We have discussed that in the past. The Government are planning extensive legislation and considering the registration of nursing homes and residential homes and whether we can merge the two streams. Elderly people in residential homes who need nursing services must be moved to nursing homes, which is not in their interests. We are examining how we can make that more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) rightly talked about poverty. I like to think that for the first time, we have recognised that the basis for much ill health is poverty. If we do not tackle poverty, we will continue to be at the bottom of many leagues. The Green Paper and the social exclusion policy concentrate on that. However, as I said in my opening speech, the best way to deal with poverty is to give everyone a job. A job is the key that opens the door, not only to health, but to everything. Once people have a job, they have a future, a stake in society and the desire to make choices; they do not live only in the present, but think about the future and have economic means. That is why we have concentrated so much on jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also talked about waiting lists and about not distorting priorities by concentrating on reducing the numbers. Much of that is a red herring. Waiting lists sometimes have more to do with organisational arrangements than with money. Huge waiting lists might be for minor ailments that can be dealt with easily and do not, therefore, compete with other clinical priorities. Clinical priority must not be interfered with. I can guarantee that such decisions will be local ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the nursing and midwifery practice development unit. The person in charge will be appointed at the end of this year, and we hope to have it up and running by the beginning of next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very committed to nurse prescribing. There is scope to develop that, and not only that—it has long been one of my campaigns to develop and expand what nurses do. Nurses' talents are under-utilised and I am delighted that there is a nurse practice at the Vale of Leven district general hospital, where I saw nurses stitching and performing other tasks. That, and nurse prescribing, is the way forward for nursing. We have pilot schemes, which we want to examine and test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
all on hip operations and the like, for which the waiting lists are very long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the reason for the additional £44 million that we are spending. We are waiting for boards to come forward with plans. I am about to announce an extra £20 million for the short term. I do not want to throw all the money at that problem because I want to ensure, this time, that when we reduce the waiting lists for hip operations, they remain reduced. If we just throw money at the problem, the minute we take it away, the waiting lists will go up again. The support group's role will be to consider why waiting lists are longer in some areas and what structural changes need to be made, and to put those structural changes in place so that the waiting lists remain reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extra £16 million will be spent in tackling homelessness. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked me to fight my corner. I have done pretty well in getting an extra £150 million for this year, and I will continue to fight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked me about St. John's. I hope that I will be able to deal with that. The proposals for the reconfiguration must come from the health board and then to the Scottish Office. We must reserve our position on all those. It would be inappropriate for anyone from the Scottish Office to say anything other than that there is no blueprint, but our preference is for one acute and one primary care trust. I will write to my hon. Friend about what will happen to the staff changes in the reduction of trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of how health service staff should be managed is very important for the Government. Until now, we have not had a good human resources strategy—I have used words that I hate. That means the way in which we look after staff in the service. We are planning to launch a completely new policy document soon. We have to value staff. We must continue to ensure that we give them the best possible conditions. We must ensure that all staff members, no matter who they are or who employs them, have facilities for lifelong learning and for continuing training. I shall, therefore, write to the hon. Member for Linlithgow about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) spoke about tobacco and its dreadful effects. In Scotland, 10,000 people a year die as a result of tobacco. That is the equivalent of one shuttle crash a week—a considerable number of deaths. We are committed to the matter, and a White Paper on that subject will be published soon. The Government have agreed to EC directives on the banning of all promotion. We are waiting to decide various targets for our White Paper on public health, which will follow the Green Paper. We are very concerned about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked me about health board chairmen and who picks them. He will know that one of the people who picks them is a member of his own party, Sir Norman Irons. Under the Nolan procedures, everybody is interviewed and examined by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
the health advisory committee, which then makes recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the Minister? I do not think that he meant that chairmen were picked by that committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not underestimate the committee's power. Every proposal for a health board chairman or member, or for a trust chairman or member, goes through what is known as the Irons committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having appeared many times before a number of Irons committees in the past, I should say that that would be an awesome prospect. The Minister should clarify that the committee scrutinises proposals that come from another place. Decisions are not taken by the committee, but by others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final decision is of course taken by Ministers. I should not like hon. Members to think that such decisions are plucked out of a hat. They are highly scrutinised by the Irons committee. If it turns a person down, there is no way that a Minister could personally appoint somebody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Nolan procedures are in place. Although there is no statutory right for a local authority member to be on a board, hon. Members will realise that, as I have stated, we put such members on to boards. Most boards have now got a local authority member. I try to reflect local political persuasion. I am then attacked for being biased when I put in place a Labour member when the area has a Labour council. Ministers have the final, say, but all proposals are highly scrutinised by the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of co-operatives was also raised. I expect co-operatives to be set up in most places. GP fundholding will finish on 1 April next year and that will be the matter closed. Other people will not wish to join a co-operative. They will have the budget to sustain medical services, but not community services, which will continue to be provided by the co-operative. Those are the only arrangements that will be in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of ambulance targets was raised. Glasgow has also had problems. We have asked the ambulance trust to deal with the issue, and to explain to us why on earth there are problems. We will consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West spoke about a number of issues. She suggested that community care hospital patients could not all be picked up by the private sector. I wish to address a number of community care issues. The thrust of community care is absolutely right. Far too many people have been inappropriately placed in hospitals, and should be in the community. The elderly want to be looked after in their homes. When that is not possible, they should at least have a community facility with privacy and dignity. We would all subscribe to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By its nature, that will require the closure of hospitals. We cannot have it both ways—either we believe in community care, or we do not. If we do, we will have to close some long-standing hospitals that are greatly loved by the community but totally inappropriate for the people within them. I support that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

move, but I do not support the wholesale view that everyone who is currently in hospital can be kept in the community. That must not be the case, and we have not followed that line in Scotland. No one should come out of hospital unless there are alternative facilities and it is the opinion of the clinician looking after them that it is appropriate for them. Those are my caveats. Please do not let us get obsessed with bricks and mortar. Many institutions are often wholly out of date and not producing the quality of care that you or I would want if we had to go into long-term care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar issues arise over maternity services. Falling birth rates and changes in the nature of practice mean that we must concentrate on educating and training neonatal paediatricians. We must consider what is the best, safest and highest quality service for all, taking into account all those other considerations. Again, do not let us be obsessed with bricks and mortar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith, states that that is the way forward. I was particularly pleased to hear my hon. Friend talking about food, because as my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale pointed out, not just excessive amounts but the low quality of food are a problem for a number of folk. We have a diet action plan and many other initiatives, but I come back to the fact that if one has a job and money, one has the economic means to make those choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith also talked about cancer services, which have been a particular success in Scotland as a result of the previous Government and current health trends. Cancer services were disjointed and we all knew that standards and mortality rates varied from area to area. That has been increasingly pulled together. The report from the Accounts Commission about ovarian cancer highlights the fact that we have not quite got it right; he is correct to say that. That is why we monitor the sound guidelines from CRAG, SNAP and various other bodies. If we have anything to learn, it is likely to be from the Accounts Commission's prediction that the places that will probably fall down in not sticking to the guidelines are the smaller hospitals. That is often because they are unable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with most of my hon. Friend's comments about how to deal with hospitals and the necessity of moving out of some of our outdated institutions and into much better services for all those involved. Yes, there is a dividing line between health and community care, and there will be a genuine consultation document on how to resolve that. No one has the answer. We may set up some local pilots, but I am concerned that the two fields do not merge. It is no good me just shifting the boundaries, because other boundaries will form. The document will be genuinely consultative; not only do I believe in consultation, but in this case we genuinely do not have the answers. I am grateful to hon. Members for keeping their speeches short and allowing me so much time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe (Glasgow, Mayhill)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say first how glad I am that I was successful in the ballot, because unemployment in Glasgow is extremely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to begin by offering my apologies to the Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) for not being at yesterday's launch of the new deal in Glasgow. My invitation could not have been in my post here any earlier than Friday morning. It is a point that might be worth taking up with whoever deals with the post in the Scottish Office. I would have been there if I had known about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to read in today's newspapers that no fewer than 859 employers have signed up to the new deal in Scotland. That is a quarter of the United Kingdom quota. Employers who have signed up in Glasgow include Scottish Power, Stakis, the One Stop Wedding Shop, Infomart, the 	<i>Daily Record</i> and the 	<i>Sunday Mail.</i> Discussions are also going on with Rangers and Celtic football clubs. If only my local team Partick Thistle could join in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of how voluntary effort can manage to save jobs. I am particularly glad to welcome the excellent news that the millennium link canal project will now go ahead. European assistance of £8.59 million has been confirmed and the remainder of the funding that was needed will now come from Scottish Enterprise, British Waterways and the local authorities. That is important not only for all the benefits that regenerating the canal from west to east will bring, but it has been independently estimated that it will provide over 4,000 new jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with all that good news, Glasgow still has a enormous unemployment problem. Maryhill in particular has a very high level of unemployment. I am indebted to Steve Inch, the head of regeneration in Glasgow city council for information that the Glasgow north priority partnership area, which contains part of my constituency, has the highest unemployment rate of all regeneration areas in the city. In January 1996, Glasgow north's unemployment rate was 22.4 per cent. compared with 15.5 per cent. for Glasgow as a whole, which is bad enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unemployment rates in Glasgow constituencies are high and have remained high for many years. In March 1996 the rates in the worst affected areas ranged from 11.9 per cent. in Govan to 17.2 per cent. at Provan; Maryhill was in between at 15.2 per cent. The top six places for unemployment are all held by Glasgow constituencies: Provan, Springburn, Maryhill, Central—as it then was—Garscadden and Govan. Not surprisingly, health indicators tell their story too. Glasgow as a whole has a mortality rate of 140. Glasgow north's is 182.3, the worst in the city. Income support claims have risen in Maryhill by 3.6 per cent. from 1994 to 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Free school meals uptake is extremely high in Glasgow north. It is over three times higher than the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
Scottish rate, which is 20 per cent. In Glasgow north it is 63.1 per cent., in Castlemilk it is 69.8 per cent., in Easterhouse it is 62 per cent. and in east end 57.3 per cent. Those rates are all well above the Glasgow average of 41 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clothing and footwear grants follow the same pattern. The uptake for such grants in Glasgow north is as high as 79.6 per cent. Even that is overtaken by Easterhouse where the take up is 80.8 per cent. and Castlemilk at 86.8 per cent. Analysis of deprivation statistics shows that most of the worst cases of deprivation in Maryhill are included in the Glasgow north priority partnership area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, an additional 25 enumeration districts in the constituency that are in the worst 1 to 10 per cent. in Scotland are not included in the PPA. Measured by number of enumeration districts, this level of deprivation is higher than many other entire unitary authorities and by itself exceeds Aberdeen and South Ayrshire, both of which have their own PPA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could I ask my hon. Friend to recognise that Glasgow contains nearly half of the most deprived areas in Scotland? Maryhill has more multiple deprivation than any other unitary authority area. I hope that he will agree that the previous Government's decision to award Glasgow only four out of 15 priority partnership areas in Scotland has resulted in my constituency being starved of the funding that it should, in fairness, have received. I hope that he will take steps to ensure that in future Glasgow receives its fair share of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, Glasgow needs jobs. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary emphasised this morning, jobs are the main means of getting out of poverty and avoiding ill health. Many of my constituents are too old, too ill or too disabled to work, but many others will benefit from more jobs being made available. Would my hon. Friend be willing to explore the possibility of the city council and local housing associations being used as employers offering training in building crafts through the new deal while, at the same time, benefiting housing stock? That would also bring benefits to the health of Glasgow's citizens. I am not asking my hon. Friend to give a yes or no response this morning; merely to explore the possibility of carrying that out to boost job prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow needs a serious assault on its high levels of unemployment and deprivation. I accept that there is no overnight miracle cure, but people need to have some hope of a cure. I therefore ask my hon. Friend to accord the matter the priority that it deserves and to work towards ending the neglect of Glasgow which resulted from the pure political spite of the previous Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) on obtaining this Adjournment debate and on her assiduously argued case for Glasgow. She always speaks well for Glasgow, especially for her Maryhill constituency. I was glad that she mentioned the millennium link—an important decision—and I should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
like to pay tribute to the efforts made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to secure the best outcome at a time when it looked beyond our reach. It is a very satisfactory outcome indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short term the project will create 4,000 construction jobs and in the longer term it will create at least double that number of tourism-related jobs. Once the infrastructure is in place the potential is enormous. The environmental aspects of the millenium link are also significant and it will directly benefit the constituencies of Glasgow, Garscadden and Maryhill among others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday was a day of mixed fortunes: the new deal was a good announcement but there was bad news on the jobs front from elsewhere in Scotland. It would be a pity if the positive news of the millenium link was lost in the tirade of conflicting signals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to support Glasgow's economy however I can. I want to remedy past wrongs and I do not underestimate the extent of the problems that Glasgow faces. The key to Glasgow's future lies partly in new industries and new jobs but it is also important not to forget the more traditional industries—still a major part of the Glasgow economy which cannot be allowed to slip into the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to be able to tell my hon. Friend that the Scottish Office is to sponsor a major seminar in Glasgow on the future of the shipbuilding and maritime industries. As I have made clear since starting my new job, the Government do and will continue to support the longer-established Scottish industries, including shipbuilding, which is an important part of Scotland's industrial future, not just of its past. The seminar will bring together all the players in the shipbuilding industry to establish the benefits that could be gained from working together more closely on such matters as marketing, skills training and continuity of employment within the various yards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We presently work on an individual yard basis with the shipbuilding industry. Management and the work force—we met the trade unions last week—appreciate the Scottish Office's new willingness to be involved in shipbuilding and to help to ensure the industry's future. The short-term priority is to protect the existing safeguards and jobs, but I hope that we shall also study new opportunities positively. By pooling information and ideas, we can make progress for all sectors of the industry. I want the seminar to deal not only with shipbuilding, but to explore the possibilities of expanding other maritime industries—ship repairing, ship management and all forms of merchant shipping, all of which are a large part of Glasgow's past. I have a personal belief that they can also be a large part of Glasgow's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the new deal, yesterday we had a successful lunch at the fruit market in Glasgow. More than 700 employers were represented out of about 800 who have signed up in Scotland. We expect that figure to grow rapidly to around 2,000 during the next few weeks. The snowball will keep rolling along. Glasgow is particularly important to the new deal in Scotland. About 3,000 unemployed young people, aged between 18 and 24, claim the job seekers allowance and have been unemployed for six months or more. They have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
become eligible for the new deal, which will give them real prospects of finding long-term employment. It is not in anybody's interest to denigrate or undermine the new deal. The reality that we already see in Tayside is that it creates real jobs for real people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday morning, I heard on the radio one of the most miserable individuals I have heard in a long time from some poverty alliance or other. He did not seem to think that there was anything good happening in the world—certainly not in the new deal. The contrast with that opinion and those of the young people who had actually experienced it in Tayside was remarkable. Knowing the journalistic trade a little, I have no doubt that the journalists would have gone looking for people who were disgruntled with it. In fact, everyone to whom they spoke said that it was a complete transformation from anything that had gone before and was geared to the needs of the individual. That is the strength of the new deal: it is geared to the needs of the individual, with serious resources behind it. Already, more than 100 people in Tayside are finding jobs under the new deal. If we can replicate that in Glasgow, it will make a major impression on the problem of long-term youth unemployment, with tremendous spin-offs and social consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the rather miserable fellow's complaints was that nobody had spoken to young people about what shape they wanted the new deal to take. As my hon. Friend has good reason to know, that is simply untrue. One of the events that I attended in my constituency was specifically geared to the client group. We spent a good day talking with the client group about what they wanted the new deal to do for them. We answered their questions about how it would affect benefit, how they could get on to it, how it fed into further education, and so on. It could not have been a more grassroots operation. I congratulate my hon. Friend on instigating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal is important and nobody should underestimate its potential. The aim of the new deal is not to wipe out unemployment. It is not a unique panacea. Yesterday, I was well aware of the fact that other things are happening in other sectors of the economy and that there will be setbacks. That is something that we must live with and try to remedy. Quite irrrespective of what is happening elsewhere in the economy, the aim of the new deal is specific and unchannging. Its importance is not in any way diminished because it is directed specifically at the long-term unemployed and, particularly, the young long-term unemployed. That does not deserve to be denigrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another initiative, about which I am pleased to tell the Committee, is geared specifically to areas such as our own and the problems of high levels of unemployment in areas that were denuded of manufacturing activity during the 1980s. It is sometimes forgotten that there were major manufacturing employers in areas such as Maryhill and Ruchill, which I know well. During the madness in the 1980s, many big manufacturers who provided work for local people were torn out of those communities. The importance of that cannot be overstated. Places were left with no work, and, increasingly, people had no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
facility to travel elsewhere to find work. Any strategy for returning some prosperity to those communities must have at its heart the intention to provide work in them. It is not good enough for an economic development agency to claim that people can travel to work elsewhere. Work should be provided where the need is greatest. A comprehensive strategy for tackling social exclusion as it is fashionably known, must deal with that difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office will pilot a new initiative, which offers special incentives to companies to invest in areas of high unemployment and to recruit an agreed share of the work force from the local community. I shall announce further details shortly. They are currently being worked on, but we intend to focus the benefits of regional selective assistance more on communities where the need for work is greatest. The initiative will be piloted in several areas in Scotland. I shall announce the selected areas, and full details of implementation, shortly. I know that that will be welcomed in areas such as ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is excellent news. I hope that I have made a strong case for my constituency to be one of the pilot areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend says, and I hope that the Adjournnnment debate will be productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to suggest that Glasgow was left out in inward investment and the siting of new industries. I have focused on old industries, but, even while I have been in this job, several announcements that are good for Glasgow have been made. For example, Teletech holdings and Tesco will create 800 jobs in new call centre operations. Eaton corporation, the American engineering company, has located its European finance centre in Glasgow. That will create 96 jobs by 1999. There is a steady stream of such good jobs. It is wrong to think that call centres provide low-grade jobs. There are some high-grade call centre jobs, a good proportion of which come to Glasgow. Several announcements that I have had the good fortune to make since last May have affected the centre of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that problems exist that are peculiar to Glasgow. The city has had a hard time. Many old industries have gone. However, there is good news about Glasgow, and we should proclaim it. The Glasgow employment zone steering group predicts that there will be an extra 16,000 jobs in Glasgow by 2005. European funding of £260 million is being spent in and around Glasgow between 1997 and 1999. Over the next three years, £30 million in urban programme resources will be spent in Glasgow's regeneration areas. A new, strong partnership is being developed between Glasgow and the Scottish Office to tackle the city's problems. The Scottish Office has joined the board of the Glasgow regeneration alliance to support the city's development. On 6 February, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that we would commit £500,000 of new money to help the regeneration alliance develop a strategic plan to assist the city. The success of the alliance is crucial because it brings together all the key agencies that work for the city's revival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
Making the most of the opportunities for regenerating the most deprived communities requires a comprehensive long-term strategy and the Scottish Office intends to play a full and supportive role in preparing and implementing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New rules to stimulate private sector industrial and commercial development will benefit Glasgow. The new property employment support programme means that grants and rental guarantees available to private sector companies engaged in development of industrial and commercial property will be assessed against local needs rather than national impact. Initially, the urban partnership and priority partnership areas will benefit from the new programme. There are four priority partnership areas in Glasgow. The east end, the north and Easterhouse together with the urban partnership in Castlehill will benefit from that initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reminded that we inherited the list of 10 priority partnership areas from the Tories and I am sympathetic. Just as Glasgow can be viewed as in need of more of them, I think that my area of north Ayrshire should have one. We all know that the approach of the general election had something to do with the designation of those areas. The consolation must be the little good that that did for the previous Government. The problem is that they were set for 10 years, and are now written in tablets of stone. Areas that should have been priority partnership areas are not, and we must think about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow is the only area in Scotland and one of only five in the United Kingdom selected for employment zone status. Employment zones are important. They are an exciting initiative in a new approach to bringing all long-term unemployed people off benefit and getting them into work. They complement the new deal in not being restricted to particular age groups. The Glasgow partnership responsible for the enterprise zone, led by the Glasgow Development Agency with the council and employers as partners, will tailor help to individuals' needs, as happens under the new deal, to provide the best chance of getting a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new approach will help people aged 25 or over, who have been unemployed for a year or more, to move from welfare to work. In particular, it will target harder to reach groups, including older people, lone parents, people with disabilities and people from ethnic minorities. The approach is a concerted one, backed by serious resources. Its targets are people who have been unemployed in the long term—but not for as long as those who would qualify for the new deal. Just as under the new deal, everyone in this initiative will be allocated a caseworker to provide support throughout the programme. I congratulate Glasgow on the quality of its bid, which led to it becoming one of five employment zones. We thought that all the necessary ingredients for the initiative to work were present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot is happening under the auspices of different initiatives, and Glasgow's special needs are always borne in mind when announcements are made about the Scottish economy—and certainly in my area of responsibility. We are aware that in many ways
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
Glasgow has suffered loss—through local government reorganisation, some would say, and with respect to movement of population. It has had many problems. However, as anyone who lives there or cares for it knows, it is also a city with a great deal going for it. I hope that, in a relatively short time, through such measures as I have outlined, we shall be able to make a real impact on Glasgow's problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that in an attack on Scotland's social problems, the first one that must be got right is work. The biggest challenge of all is to get people into employment in Glasgow and give them a chance to achieve their aspirations and potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education system is closely geared to the priorities that I have set out. I know that the rationalisation of schools in Glasgow is a mixed blessing in some people's view, but everyone agrees in principle that it had to be tackled. However, we did not just tell Glasgow, "It is up to you; get on with it." The sum of £12 million is available to Glasgow in addition to normal resources to facilitate that process of rationalisation. It is another illustration of the fact that where money is available we will spend it in fair proportion to meet Glasgow's needs. As my hon. Friend said, the social needs of Glasgow are extremely high in proportion to the rest of Scotland. I hope that that does not become a divisive issue. We all live in the one community. It irritates me to read criticism of the fact that a bit extra is going to Glasgow. I simply say, "Why not?" Resources should be allocated on the basis of need. No one can dispute the fact that the needs of Glasgow are high relative to those of Scotland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general trend of the economy in recent months has been favourable. Unemployment is coming down. It has come down quite sharply in Glasgow along with the rest of Scotland. I hope that that can be maintained. Clearly there is still need for special measures, particularly in areas of high unemployment. That is certainly the case in parts of Glasgow. We cannot be accused of turning our backs on that. There is a real commitment to address the problem and not just the areas that are relatively easy to deal with. We want to have a go at the comprehensive economic revival of the parts of Scotland that have so far proved resistant to short-term schemes. If we can continue that approach and work closely in partnership with everyone who has a stake in the Glasgow economy, both public and private sectors, we can make the progress I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partnership can be a cliché if it is not implemented in practice. There is a spirit in Glasgow of people working together towards common ends. I attend events on a weekly basis where public and private sectors are working well together and the local authority is working well with the Glasgow development agency and Scottish Enterprise. There do not seem to be many problems of people working against one another or a fragmentation of the approach. There is also an important tier of smaller economic development agencies working in each of the communities of Glasgow. It is important that they are also brought into the network and involved in the various initiatives.
