	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our debate on community safety is scheduled to finish at one o'clock, so I would appeal to Committee members, including the Minister, for brief contributions. That will enable me to call as many speakers as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee do now adjourn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that community safety has remained one of the Government's top priorities over the past 13 months. Reducing crime and anti-social behaviour and improving community safety are matters that I have long pursued—as a local authority councillor, as a constituency Member of Parliament, and more recently as the Scottish Officer Minister for home affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience makes it crystal clear that people throughout Scotland are fed up with crime and antisocial behaviour in their communities. We all want safer communities. Much has already been done in the 13 months we have been in office. However, our debate will show that we are taking important new steps in tackling outstanding matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our manifesto promised a new approach to law and order. That was summed up in the phrase, "Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime". We want to protect people's right to live in confidence and without fear for their own safety or that of others. That is the working definition of community safety. I will briefly explain what it means in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, we want to prevent crime. Crime has fallen by 23 per cent. since 1991. However, the tough approach to crime requires that we catch offenders. The clear-up rate has risen steadily from 29 per cent. in 1991 to 37 per cent. in the year 1996 to 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tough approach requires that criminals be dealt with quickly and efficiently by the police, by prosecutors and by the courts. It requires that the courts sentence those who are found guilty in a way that protects the public and reduces the likelihood of re-offending. We want to take tough action to stamp out the culture of violence and we must convince the judiciary, the public and the press that non-custodial sentences are effective penalties and certainly not soft options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the core philosophy underpinning the work that we are doing on tackling crime and improving community safety. Community crime does not affect the whole of Scotland uniformly. It does not even
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
affect a particular community all the time. Much has been done—and much more is in hand—to tackle that problem. We do not face an impossible task and we should not be pessimistic about what we can achieve. Today, we are debating what we can achieve in partnership to tackle community issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to road and fire safety. So far I have concentrated my remarks on the crime prevention angle. However, community safety is a much broader term. Road safety, for example, matters to local communities. I am glad to say that there has been a big decrease in road accidents and casualties. In 1997 there were 41 per cent. fewer deaths and 51 per cent. fewer serious injuries in Scotland than in the early 1980s. That decrease is thanks to the energetic work of many people and organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speeding offences have decreased from a peak of 100,000 in 1991 to approximately 92,000 in 1997. That too is welcome. However, every day one person dies in a road accident and 11 are seriously injured. Those figures are unacceptable if we are serious about community safety. They suggest that there is no scope for complacency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Excessive speed is thought to be a contributory cause in an estimated one third of fatal accidents. Again, that figure is far too high. Such accidents are mostly in built-up areas with a 30 miles an hour speed limit—those are precisely the kind of communities that we are discussing today. I am glad that the police's "Speedwatch" campaign concentrated on those areas. We are piloting 20 miles an hour schemes in 75 places to make it easier for local authorities to introduce such schemes where they are needed, often in the heart of communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "community safety" also covers fire safety improvements, which are much needed because tragic fatalities are all too common. Last year, 74 people died in house fires in Scotland; that is about 12 per cent. of the UK total. Although that death toll is much smaller than the 109 deaths in 1993, it is not a good record; the Scottish population is about 8.6 per cent. of that of the UK, but we still have 12 per cent. of the total number of fatalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The immediate causes of house fires are avoidable: carelessness with cigarette ends and matches, leaving pans on the cooker and heaters that are misused or faulty. Alcohol and drugs are thought to have played a part in well over half of fatal house fires last year. Although about 90 per cent. of houses have a smoke alarm, such alarms were fitted in less than half of the houses in which there was a fatal fire. In those cases, only one third of the alarms worked; in the remaining cases, normally the battery had been removed or was flat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Communities can do a lot better than that. In January, I launched a £250,000 television and newspaper advertising campaign to remind people of the actions needed to avoid becoming a casualty in a fire. Looking to the future, the Government have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
broadly accepted the recommendations of the community fire safety task force and have emphatically confirmed that community fire safety should be a core activity of the fire service and be given high priority by the brigades and the Scottish Office. I have seen what a powerful message the fire brigades can give to children and elderly people, two of the more vulnerable groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that we shall see a further reduction in deaths. That depends on partnership, however, especially between fire brigades, local authorities and other housing providers, and householders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must do more about having fire alarms in every house. However, there is no point in having a fire alarm if it is faulty, if it has no battery or if the batteries are flat. This is a serious issue, to which we must give urgent attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only community fire safety that benefits from partnerships. They are vital to community safety more broadly, and the Government are taking an important step in that direction today. It gives me some satisfaction to announce the publication of a strategy for action on community safety, copies of which have been distributed to hon. Members. The document flows from two community safety conferences which I arranged. The first was in October, with local authorities and voluntary bodies; the second was in March, with the business community. The conferences showed that the time was right for much closer collaboration locally, and the strategy for action is the blueprint for that. It is designed to improve community safety in Scotland through partnerships between public, private and voluntary bodies. I am especially pleased that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland have been able to endorse the publication in partnership with the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy encourages local authorities to take the lead in forming local partnerships, involving the police and other bodies who can influence community safety. That might include public bodies such as the health board or Scottish Homes, business interests such as the local enterprise companies or chambers of commerce, and voluntary bodies such as community councils, youth clubs or neighbourhood watch associations. The partnership might cover an entire council area, or a town or village, or part of a city—any part of Scotland that is able to take effective action to improve community safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy does not say exactly what should be done. That must be decided locally, in the light of local needs and opportunities, and as part of other local policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Fife)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking at the document to which the Minister referred, in particular the part about road safety. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Minister has spent some time dealing with that issue this morning. Perhaps I should declare an interest as I have a house in the village of Gateside where there is considerable annoyance at the fact that there appears to be a compelling case for a 30 mile an hour speed limit rather than the existing 40 miles an hour limit. The Minister will also be aware that I have written to him about a primary school at Montrave in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has spoken of local initiative. However, that is sometimes circumscribed by the fact that there are national standards which determine whether speed limits may be lowered. Are the Government willing to consider that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the matter concerns me. The Government want a balanced partnership between central and local government and other organisations. In the past, many local authorities have felt frustrated; they felt that they had a good case for change which was thwarted by national guidelines and policies and, often, indifference. We are setting up pilot projects to look at 20 mph speed limits. Eventually we will give local authorities more discretion regarding speed limits in their areas. That is being worked out at present, but I hope that we will take on board the serious issues that have been raised by the hon. and learned Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way again and for what he has just said. Does he agree that there ought to be a presumption that in the area of a primary school there should be a 20 mph speed limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In most cases that could be a general and good presumption to make. Clearly we need to look at every school and its surroundings. Some are in very dangerous locations, others are not. I take the general thrust of the hon. and learned Gentleman's comments: we must be more sensitive to local and parental requirements and the needs of children. I have no doubt that that matter will be taken care of in the policy we are currently working out. It is essential that local people, as well as the bodies that can contribute to the partnership, have a voice in that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect to see results from these partnerships we want real action, not planning documents. So the strategy recommends that targets should be set and monitored through crime figures, or fire or road accident casualty rates, or through surveys of local people. The Government will be keeping closely in touch with these outcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that we have not needed to resort to legislation in Scotland to drive home the need for local councils and the police to work together to combat crime and improve community safety. There is already ample evidence that councils and the police are voluntarily, indeed enthusiastically, entering into such partnerships. Only two weeks ago, I was involved in the launch of Fife's community safety strategy, a formal agreement between Fife council and Fife
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
constabulary, which will include a wider partnership of relevant national and locally based agencies along with the local community. I know that similar arrangements have been started elsewhere in Scotland. That is precisely what our strategy for action proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to look briefly at some of the Government's achievements in the past 12 months. Obviously the strategy for action looks to the future but we have already been involved in introducing initiatives to help community safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been working closely with the police to focus their action on the problem. I would like to pay tribute to what every force has achieved. One of the threats to community safety, which concerns the police and the Scottish Office alike, is repeat victimisation—the pernicious fact that crime tends to be concentrated on relatively few people and places, with a small number of people becoming chronic victims. The Scottish Office is publishing today the report of a conference held in January to brief the Scottish police service on the problem and to encourage the adoption of a strategy which uses prior victimisation as a measure of need for local policing. By giving priority to the most victimised members of society, it is possible to reduce crime and increase the clear-up rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A demonstration of our commitment and a cornerstone for our positive approach has been to establish a post of community safety development officer within COSLA. The post, which the Scottish Office is funding for two years, will help individual local authorities to develop their own community safety strategies. The success of that appointment recently persuaded us to set up a similar arrangement for a local authority drug co-ordinator, also operating within COSLA. The post will provide a local authority contact on drugs issues at national level, promote good practice, and support a proposed Scottish local government drugs forum. That is important, because the drugs problem is one which local communities often mention as a menace to normal life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's most significant contributions to the safety of people and property in our high streets and towns is our substantial and continuing investment in close circuit television. I recently announced a further 23 successful applications to add to the 60 already approved in the two previous rounds; and I am pleased to say that, because of continuing demand, we have extended the scheme for a further year. CCTV needs to be carefully managed to avoid the "big brother is watching you" angle. But our experience, and Scottish Office research, indicates that people welcome the security which cameras provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Rachel Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Does he agree that CCTV has led to a substantial reduction in crime and vandalism around Dunfermline high street since it was introduced. Does he further agree that the recent announcement by Fife police and Fife council to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
appoint additional community-based policemen as part of the community safety strategy will also have a significant effect? That announcement had been greatly welcomed by many of my constituents, and particularly by pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse my hon. Friend's warm sentiments about what is happening in Fife. Fife constabulary and the local authority deserve to be congratulated on their initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited several CCTV sites throughout Scotland. My experience is that such systems give the public, especially the elderly, the confidence to go about their normal business. CCTV lowers the crime rate dramatically. For example, when I was on Tayside, I saw a CCTV camera that was focused on a shop entrance. A shoplifter entered the shop and filled his pockets in full view of the camera. As he was leaving the shop, he turned round, saw the camera and exclaimed, "Oh God!". He turned to the shop to take everything out of his pockets and went on his way. Crime prevention is at the top of my agenda, and that example shows how CCTV can benefit the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian H. Donohoe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister put pressure on Enterprise Ayrshire? It co-funded schemes in Kilmarnock and Ayr, but missed out Irvine. Given the obvious advantages of CCTV cameras, will my hon. Friend exert such pressure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that it is not my style to put pressure on anyone. It is encouraging that, throughout Scotland, there has been tremendous participation by the private sector—enterprise companies and a host of other organisations—in CCTV schemes. I have no doubt that the local company in Ayshire will see the wisdom of having such a scheme in Irvine quite soon. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend is more able to put pressure on that company than I am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently had the privilege of visiting the Angus CCTV scheme. It is an innovative arrangement that links the seven major towns in Angus to a centrally controlled monitoring station in Forfar. Geographically speaking, it is the largest CCTV system in Europe and it has been a tremendous success for the local community. Every council area in Scotland is giving an even commitment to such schemes, and I warmly welcome that. All authorities should get involved, because improving safety for the people that they represent should be high on their political agendas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another demonstration of our commitment to safer communities was our recent promise to fund three "communities that care" projects in Scotland—an approach that has worked well elsewhere. The programme will be locally managed and accountable. They will operate by establishing a working partnership between local people, agencies and organisations in order to achieve sustainable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
reductions in youth crime, school failure, drug abuse and school-age pregnancy. They are pilot projects that will be carefully evaluated so that we can share the experience and benefits with others across Scotland. They are one way of achieving the goals of the strategy for action on community safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crime and Disorder Bill is currently before the House. Among an important range of measures, it will provide a new power to deal with anti-social behaviour. Like other members of the Committee, I know from first-hand experience the misery caused by anti-social neighbours—the proverbial families from hell. The Bill will empower local authorities to seek a civil order from the sheriff to prevent such behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a similar vein, the Bill will tackle the problem of noise nuisance by giving the police a new statutory power to confiscate noise-making equipment. How many hon. Members have received complaints about noise? At present, the police can go along, but there is nothing that they can do. The equipment, the noise and the irritation remain and often the problem gets out of hand. In future, the police will have the power the confiscate the equipment. Some people may think that that power is draconian, but if it tackles the problem when it arises, it should be warmly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too much fear is generated in communities by sex offenders. That is why we have taken several steps to reduce the risk to the public. From last September, the Sex Offenders Act 1997 imposed a requirement on certain sex offenders to register with the police. That was only a start. To support that measure, we are currently revising and consolidating guidance issued to the police and other agencies. We have given the police retrospective powers for DNA testing of sex and violent offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crime and Disorder Bill will also introduce new sex offender orders, which will make it easier to control sex offenders' activities if they pose a threat to our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Use of the orders will also mean registering under the Sex Offenders Act 1997. We are slowly but surely drawing the net wider to ensure that public safety is paramount, particularly with respect to sex offending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the Minister back for a moment to the matter of anti-social behaviour. He knows about the problem of harassment and intimidation of witnesses, and how difficult it is to get witnesses to illegal activities to attend court. He has considered the greater use of professional witnesses, which the Scottish Affairs Select Committee recommended in its report on antisocial behaviour? Many people endorsed that recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Lady's comments. We are looking at various measures to tackle the issue. An anti-social behaviour order would
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
be based in the civil courts, but breach would be a criminal offence, with severe punishment. Removal of equipment that is connected with a nuisance is one possible response. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and I are considering the use of professional witnesses. We accept that it would be a step forward, but it is important, especially now that anti-social behaviour orders are contemplated, to ensure that professional evidence is treated as such. We do not want it to be viewed as something that, in a wider context, is more sinister; I appreciate that the Select Committee did not suggest that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The work done by Sir Alec Jeffreys and others on DNA testing is truly remarkable, not least because as hon. Members will have found in their constituency work, it has led to earlier elimination of some people from police inquiries than would otherwise be the case. The work has related not just to catching criminals, but also to relieving the anxieties of those who are not guilty.

Do I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister considers that, in that context, there is a problem in relation to court evidence. I realise that the question cannot be easily answered off the top of the head, but if there is a problem will the Minister write to us about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some court cases DNA had proved more problematic than the prosecution anticipated, but I should be happy to write to my hon. Friend about whether a problem exists in the Scottish courts. My hon. Friend is right about the work that has been done on DNA testing. Not only has it provided a basis for backtracking over 10, 20 or 30 years, and bringing people to justice for crimes committed that long ago; it has also eliminated people from investigations at an early stage. It has benefited the Scottish police. We lead the way in high technology policing. Today we are considering that as part of the community safety initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The return of paedophiles to a community raises strong emotions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past year we have implemented the Sex Offenders Act 1997; that was a small start. More guidance has been issued about the use of information by police, social workers and the community, and sex offender orders are planned. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that public fears about what is happening need to be allayed. That will take longer than other aspects of what we are doing. In my view, partnership is needed. We will do as much to secure the safety of the community, but we must prevent vigilante action. I understand the frustration that arises. There is a long way to go to achieve partnership. We have made progress, but the issue

Friend the Minister agrees that the safety of children is paramount. Is not it disturbing to learn that, since the Children (Scotland) Act 1980 was enacted, in only ten cases has a suspected abuser—rather than a child—been removed from the family home? That was not what we intended when the Act was passed: the intention was to ensure children's safety. Will my hon. Friend look at that aspect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will. In terms of my remit, this matter is taken extremely seriously. I shall pass on my hon. Friend's comment to my hon. Friend the Minister for Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), the Minister with responsibility for social work, and come back to her with a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are taking another significant step. When we drafted the Crime and Disorder Bill, we were concerned about the risk to the public when a prisoner is released. The Bill does two things. It allows the courts to instal a supervision aspect of up to five years for a sentence of over four years. For sex offenders, the court will be able to impose a supervision requirement of up to 10 years in addition to the sentence, regardless of its length. Taken together, that is a fairly formidable package. It will not solve all the problems or relieve the grief in communities, but we have come a long way since May of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crime and Disorder Bill includes a provision to tackle racial offences. Racist crime is especially abhorrent: its victims are selected because of who they are. We want all the people of Scotland, of whatever race, to have the full protection of the law. We have introduced a new offence to combat racial harassment, and imposed on the courts a requirement to take any racist element of offences into account when sentencing. That should lead to heavier sentences for people found guilty of such crimes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that proposal, not least because it is an objective that each member of the Committee would share. However, from my experience of criminal cases in which a racial element was involved, I know that courts invariably take that into account. I have sometimes heard judges say that a sentence of five years rather than three years was imposed because a racial element was involved. Might we not be creating an unnecessary power, as the Scottish courts already take account of this aspect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That was debated before the provision went into the Crime and Disorder Bill. I was anxious to have a new specific offence because we felt that we should add to the powers of the courts and of the police. However, we were fortunate in Scotland because the racist element was taken into consideration
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
in sentencing. The Bill strengthened that to a requirement, because it was not wholly consistent across the courts. Now we have a new offence, which is partly for criminal justice purposes, but also to send a strong message that society is serious about racism. That was one powerful reason for the new offence, but, as the hon. and learned Gentleman rightly said, there was debate about whether the provision added anything. We judged that it did, which is why it was in the Crime and Disorder Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed many of the Government's new measures, but of course any policy for criminal justice and community safety must be set against the Government's wider strategy of social and economic progress in Scotland. Therefore, we decided on a 10-year programme to try to build in Scotland a modern society, and a decent one, which takes collective responsibility for many of the problems that people face—whether they are trapped on benefits, in poor housing, without work or living in poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our key is a society in which people are included, not excluded. That lies at the heart of our approach to virtually everything that we are doing in Scotland. The Government's first budget laid down the biggest-ever programme to reduce youth, and long-term, unemployment, and our new deal, which is worth more than £300 million, will be of significant benefit to those groups. It is an ambitious programme to get long-term unemployed people back to work. By giving young people and adults whose self-worth has been badly damaged by periods of unemployment hope for the future through education, skills and opportunities, and a job, we reinforce not only their self-worth, but their appreciation of the wider society in which they function. Social inclusion is at the heart of our policy, and providing work is our major strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On health, we need to tackle smoking, drinking, and drug misuse during pregnancy if we want a decent, fairer society. Teenage pregnancy increases the risk of anti-social behaviour and offending in the child. That is borne out by research. We want to improve Scotland's health and tackle the problems that I described, and thus reduce crime in the longer term. Healthy living centres, on which £34 million of lottery money will be spent, will help to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent Government guidance on drug misuse services in Scotland acknowledged that health and social policy could reduce drug-related crime. One example of that is provided by the growing evidence about the impact of prescribing substitute drugs. The United Kingdom drugs strategy, which was published recently, will further strengthen Government efforts to deal with drug misuse and its consequences. The recently refocussed Scotland Against Drugs campaign has a wide-ranging remit aimed at reducing drug misuse and its consequences in local communities. That inevitably affects community safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crime and Disorder Bill provides for a new drug treatment and testing order, which will be an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
alternative to custody. Many people go to prison for criminality that is based on drug addiction and misuse. The Bill establishes a tough, non-custodial sentence, which will include treatment, but also testing. A positive test would constitute a breech of the order, which could result in a custodial sentence. I hope that the order will greatly help the courts to tackle a grave social issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office is in an excellent position to coordinate the multi-faceted action that is necessary to promote community safety. Many of the wider policies that the Scottish Office pursues on health, education, employment and enforcement will make an impact on community safety and crime reduction. I hope that every party that is represented in the Committee shares the Government's priorities. Political partnership, and partnership with communities and with the police will create the better Scotland that we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general election helped with crime, disorder and community safety because it lanced the boil caused by the political bidding war. The debate about methods of achieving aims that everyone shares is now more sensible. That is disappointing for the media, because it means that there will not be the same political cut and thrust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone from the media who reported the Crime and Disorder Bill Committee would have been disappointed by the change in style, even of the official Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is best to try to avoid over-selling one action as the crucial solution to problems in the community. We will sometimes have to ensure that the Government do not fall into that trap. The problems have been with us for centuries, and no single Bill or initiative will make a complete and fundamental difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can help to form a different attitude and to provide some of the tools for communities to help themselves, we can reduce the threat and disruption that crime causes. As the Minister said, building communities is at the heart of that project and the Government will have to work across Departments to achieve it. Local government must be encouraged to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
accept that wider communities start with local people and that it is not the council's role to declare, "Here is the solution, which we are providing for you on a plate". Reforming local government is central to building the communities that are necessary if community safety is to be implemented effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to encourage the Government to recognise—and they are beginning to do so—that unless the electoral system is reformed, the necessary changes at the heart of local government cannot be achieved. A culture has developed of providing services for the community, but it has not always been understood that if local government were to stand back and give direct power to communities themselves, improvements could be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds to me as if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brent, East has kindly agreed with much of what we have had to say recently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation of local government was an attempt to tackle the problem. I was active in local government for a short time during that period so I know that change can be difficult. It takes time to grasp that community councils should be given more power, that the local council does not have to provide everything for the community and that the council's proper role is to give communities the tools and powers to achieve for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sandra Osborne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
thought that they would be debating, so I shall return to the subject that is before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister acknowledged that the solution for one community group's problems may be different from the solution for another's. A solution in Glasgow could be very different from a solution in my constituency. That is why setting priorities locally is so important. Much as the Government will hate us for bringing up the subject, and despite an endless debate about it, it must be recognised that resource priorities are central to the implementation of local strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full fall-out from Thursday's announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer may not yet have been grasped. Concern about constraints on revenue spending continues while the freeing up of capital investment is welcome. I hope that the Treasury will recognise that investment in year one may bring dividends for the budget in year three. The problem of dealing with offending and having to send some people to prison cannot be solved overnight. However, starting to break the cycle of offending will help in the long term to make savings on budgets for prisons and for the police; but the money will have to be spent up front to make that long-term saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that in a three-year budgeting cycle early investment will pay dividends in the third year—if research so demonstrates. The Treasury will not be swayed by wish lists based on unproven assumptions, but if hard research demonstrates the potential benefits, it should be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about road safety. The crucial aspect of the safety campaign is to put across to drivers that they are responsible for their own safety and that they must drive according to road conditions, the condition of the car and their own health. The reality of safety engineering and research is that humans are fallible and will make mistakes. Although a driver is responsible for his actions, victims cannot control him. The role of Government and society is to support victims and to attempt, through the infrastructure, to reduce the accident rate and to minimise the consequences of driver error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Car safety has evolved over the years, but it is clear from my constituency and those of the hon. Members for Angus (Mr. Welsh) and for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) that the roads, particularly the A90 between Aberdeen and Dundee, were designed to a past standard of road safety and awareness of how to control driver behaviour. The new section of the A96 that is being built at the moment has no right turns across the dual carriageway. Roundabouts and separate junctions have been placed wherever necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That demonstrates the Scottish Office's recognition of a crucial method of reducing driver-induced accidents. I hope that when the Government finally bring out their transport White Paper they will recognise that while it is not necessary to invest in roads, willy-nilly, to encourage more road use, investment will still be needed to increase the safety of
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
roads and the communities that they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as fear of crime is almost as debilitating for a community as the crime itself, fear of accidents can have similar effect. Although the bald accident rates may not bear out those fears, the fact that road users are constantly afraid of accidents does nothing for the quality of life in their community or village. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) said about speed limits, although professionals may say that such measures, did not make much difference to the speeds in the village, they have made a big difference to the sense of safety and wellbeing within the community. Actions to help the community are to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On fire safety, the important message that the Minister got across concerned the usefulness of smoke alarms, but we must try to avoid the false alarms that result from bad installation. I know that from personal experience. I had to rescue one old lady, not from a fire, but from her smoke alarm which she could not control. It was going off because she was boiling a fish in a bag and she asked me for help as I was walking past her door. The council had carefully installed alarm just beside the vent that took the steam from the kitchen out into the hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Messages to the community about safety and building regulations and ways of making houses safer are important. I welcome the assurances given in the other place by Lord Sewel that the Government have no intention of downgrading the passive safety regulations that apply to Scottish buildings. That was a concern, given that the regulations in England and Wales are much lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem that is developing as culture changes in rural areas is that of the recruitment of retained firemen. It would help rural communities if the Government encouraged employers to release their employees to take on this extremely important and worthwhile activity. Increased commuting to work and far less work in the community is reducing the pool of people available for that essential service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CCTV schemes are a great benefit to the sense of wellbeing and it would appear that they help to prevent crime. Perhaps we need to look at how they are to be funded and managed in the long term. Who is to be responsible for ensuring that they continue into the future? Many have been started up on special schemes and partnerships and the question whether all those partnerships can be kept together in the long term. Many initiatives that happen in our society are started up as special projects, challenge funding and bids from the community, but where do they go from there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crime and Disorder Bill brought together the different parties to recognise that society is fed up with the anti-social behaviour of neighbours, noise nuisance and the threat of sex offenders. There is a realisation of how seriously sex offences are taken by the community and a growing awareness of the issues
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
involved. Many people are only just becoming fully aware of how serious sex offences are for the victims. It is important to try to tackle such offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also some anxiety about the operation of the Crime and Disorder Bill in relation to civil liberties. That has been addressed in part by the guidelines that were issued and by the culture behind the guidelines. However, it is a serious step to restrict a person's behaviour by an order, imposed on the balance of evidence, and to imprison that person if the order is broken. Such orders must be operated efficiently and effectively. They must not be offered as a panacea. There are many other actions that can be taken in the community, short of such orders, to try to help people to understand their offending behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are conscious of the way in which the orders might be served. There will be a great deal of sensitivity and reasonableness. For example, in relation to the anti-social behaviour orders, there might be 600 top-level families from hell—if we could call them that. The orders would not be applied in run of the mill cases involving anti-social neighbours. They would be applied only in serious cases, with co-operation between the police, the local authorities, the community and other organisations. There would need to be a very positive case for the application of such orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will accept that reassurance about the orders. The local authorities and the police will pay maximum attention to ensuring that civil liberties are always to the fore and that they are not undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders form part of a spectrum of measures. They are a useful tool at the end of that spectrum and will send a signal about the worst problems to the rest of the community. That will help those who are trying to promote the message about anti-social behaviour in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police might not rejoice in having the power to confiscate noise-making equipment that is causing a nuisance. They will be called on to exercise that power frequently in the early stages until it is established as a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrat Members continue to be worried about the wide-ranging powers, under clause 23 of the Crime and Disorder Bill, to enable social landlords to evict tenants for anti-social behaviour. We understand the Government's dilemma in such matters, because it makes sense to remove drug-dealing or other major anti-social or criminal activities from residential premises. However, the clause refers to offences that are punishable by imprisonment, and unfortunately that does not necessarily mean an anti-social offence
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that directly affects neighbours. All offences punishable by imprisonment—for example, major fraud and so on—have an anti-social content because they affect society. However, they do not specifically require the offenders to be removed from their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office have recognised that rehabilitation is part of the attempt to stop re-offending. We need to ensure that people keep a sense of community and that they have roots in the community. During the debates on the Crime and Disorder Bill the Minister promised to set out, before Report, the research that would be done in England and Wales. We still await that information. On Report, the House should look closely at the effects of clause 23. Some people who work in housing in England and Wales are worried that social landlords tend to want to evict their tenants and to manage their stock more easily by controlling their tenants in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, which also concerns Labour Members. Shelter and other housing groups have raised the issue with me. They are especially concerned about the changing nature of social landlords in Scotland. For the first time, we see the introduction of commercially based housing associations, which could abuse the powers given to them under clause 23. I am sure that the Minister is aware of that matter and that he will take account of the points made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Committee stage of the Crime and Disorder Bill there was much discussion of powers to be given by statute and reference was made to the case of Pepper v. Hart. However, if what is intended in the statute is clear, the courts are not very interested. Some members of the Committee look a bit confused, so I shall try to explain. Because of the wide-ranging nature of the Crime Disorder Bill, many attempts were made when it was in Committee to get assurances from Ministers on how it will operate. We hope that the courts will consider those assurances. Such assurances are more important when there is doubt about a Bill. However, if legislation is clear, there may still be a problem in the long run. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, the nature of social landlords may change. The legislation may appear dusty in five year's time, and someone may say, "I've got that power and can tidy up my stock. I'll just clear those tenants out."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can offer the reassurance that, before we implement the Crime and Disorder Bill, we shall issue guidance to landlords. I am happy to make that guidance available to hon. Members. The clause was never intended to be a charter for unscrupulous landlords, but I acknowledge the danger that has been mentioned. If the visitors to tenants are involved in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
drugs, crime and anti-social behaviour, that creates real problems. However, the Government must strike a balance. Anti-social behaviour orders will use eviction as a last resort. It makes no sense to evict someone and create a set of problems elsewhere, when it may be possible to use a smarter method of tackling the problem at source. I hope that that reassurance helps the Committee. I will also provide the research that I promised before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will particularly welcome seeing the research on what has happened in England and Wales. That will be extremely useful. We constantly fail in the United Kingdom to make use of the fact that its different components have different ways of doing things. Politicians and the media look to what is happening in Sweden, Germany or other countries without recognising that they may learn from examining how things operate on the other side of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just like the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a classic example, but I will not delve into that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not oversell the power provided for in the Crime and Disorder Bill. It is an attempt to deal with a problem in society, but it should be sold to the community as a step in the right direction and as a signal. There is still concern about the definition of race. Certain groups may fall through the net because the provision does not take account of religion. That issue will come up on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem is the availability of resources. The Minister mentioned drug treatment and testing orders, but the Bill contains a built-in provision that will let Governments off the hook. Until the Secretary of State says that the facilities are available, the orders will not be available as a sentence. I appreciate that the Government intend to run pilots, but the orders should not detract from the resources going into the drug treatment of those who have not yet offended. Those who want to take a grip of their drug habit should have access to rehabilitation. Otherwise, the habit might lead them into a life of crime. If we can break the cycle of drug dependence before drug offenders engage in wider criminal activity to fund their habit, we will do society a great service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister hit upon the importance of getting across to the public the toughness of some noncustodial sentences. In the debates on extended sentences and supervision, some members of the Committee considering the Crime and Disorder Bill failed to realise that the fact that someone is out on licence does not mean that he is not serving a sentence. It is important that the public understand that the measure of the severity of a crime is not the number of years that someone is sent to prison, but the whole package that is implemented to prevent his reoffending. That is far more fundamental in protecting society. We cannot lock away everyone for
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
ever, unless we build more prisons than we can contemplate. Prisoners will be released and society will be threatened if they re-offend. However, if they do not re-offend, there will be a benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat a question that I have put to Ministers before—I recognise that it is difficult to answer. When will there be a balance between available prison places and the demands of the prison population? A strategy for bringing those factors into balance will be a measure of our success in getting to grips with crime and disorder. There are not enough resources to cope with the people who are sent to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Feedback indicates that there are anxieties about sentencing. Courts want to use non-custodial sentences, but resources must be available for such sentences to be implemented. Local authorities and social work departments must provide the appropriate activities. Just as facilities must be available to implement drug treatment orders, so they must be available to organise community service. We will make long-term savings on prisons if we invest now in alternative sentences that benefit the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about the link between prison numbers, current overcrowding and the drive for non-custodial sentences. Existing provisions include community service orders, supervised attendance orders and probation. The Crime and Disorder Bill makes a large number of new provisions. It makes a serious attempt to provide the courts with the power to impose alternative sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court system means that the hon. Gentleman's question about movement on non-custodial sentences having an impact on prisons cannot be answered. The courts and the judiciary have the discretion to select imprisonment or non-custodial sentences. We are keen to make alternatives available to them. Clearly, that is not the situation throughout Scotland. We will be able to measure success more accurately when alternatives are in place, and when effective sentences are handed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a crucial point. Alternatives must be available for sentences to be provided. When that happens, we can examine how those alternatives are used and whether they are being used properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there are a number of other key issues. We recognise that at times community means devolving central control. However, that has benefits in the long run. Allowing people to take charge of their lives and build community networks frees up other roles for councillors, councils, Members of Parliment and Ministers. Empowering communities to take control is to be welcomed. However, we must recognise the resource implications. Fine words do not solve problems, unless they are backed by resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must reassure communities that we all recognise the seriousness of the problems that confront them. A tough way of dealing with those problems has already
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
been mentioned—that produces results, as research shows. Such results will improve the safety and wellbeing of communities. That in turn will increase the productiveness of communities and the benefit that people derive from living in and from serving their community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.29 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments about anti-social behaviour and the regulations that will soon be passed to enable the police to remove equipment that creates the nuisance of noise in people's homes. I am sure that we are all aware from our surgeries how widespread the problem is and how irritated people are by their neighbour's noise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our communities are far from regarding the removal of equipment as draconian. Many of my constituents feel that hanging is too good for neighbours who create noise, so they will certainly not object to the removal of equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to speak about noise in relation to standards of house building. I once lived in a tenement flat which was so badly built that I could hear my neighbour downstairs switching on her lights—she could hear my kitten jumping off the window sill on to the floor. When a house is built to that standard it is impossible to live normally or to play music, for example, which I have enjoyed all my life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I used to live in another house with six children living upstairs. Yet I was not even aware of it until I had lived there for a couple of weeks because it was so well built—to solid Victorian standards. We should therefore ask our housing Minister to do everything possible to improve standards in existing buildings and to ensure high building standards in future in order to abate noise nuisance. Powerful equipment that is not intended for domestic use can be used in homes. That cannot but be a nuisance when other people are subjected to it. Nevertheless, I welcome the steps that are currently being taken to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the piloting of 20 mile an hour speed limits in local communities. Many motorists do not realise that driving at 30 miles an hour can kill—a message that must be put across more strongly. In suburban areas where many children may be playing, it is not unreasonable to expect a general rule restricting speeds to 20 miles an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the policing of communities. I recently had discussions with the newly appointed chief superintendent to division C in Glasgow. He told me that the police in that division were returning to the idea of policemen travelling around the area on bicycles—an outdated practice for some time which is now being revived. It is welcome in the community: just as people like the bobby on the beat walking around the place, they like the ease of
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
communication with an officer on a bike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More needs to be done on drugs that attempting to police the problem, catch criminals and apply tough sentences. The availability of drugs depends on their supply by many impoverished countries in the world. It is the most economic option for some of those countries: they make more money from growing drugs than by growing and marketing normal products such as coffee and bananas. The western world is prepared to pay those countries a decent price for drugs, but not for coffee and bananas—we thus make trouble for ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the Minister referred to local safety groups. There is one in my own locality and it does good work. The funding of such groups is important, but they should receive funding when they are seen to prove themselves rather than just because they exist. I hope that some funding will be guaranteed for such proven activity because it is important to put the safety message across to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister also spoke about sex offenders, but he did not touch on the problem of domestic violence. The Scottish all-party children's group recently invited speakers from Scottish Women's Aid, who provided horrific figures on the continuing extent of domestic violence. It is a sad fact that, in many cases, women against whom domestic violence has been perpetrated by their partners find it impossible to get a refuge. Refuges are available for fewer than half of those seeking a place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those running the refuges face constant difficulty with funding and I hope for a more secure funding system in future, to allow the obvious needs of those places to be met and to ensure that local authorities and refuges work together more effectively than they have. That will take money, but I regard it as a high priority. Women and their children should not have to put up with living in that way and should have an alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, and a wide-ranging one, to say the least. I shall mention some of the topics discussed by the Minister and raise a few others. It is important to think about the efforts made by police forces, local councils and communities to promote community safety and fight crime, but I also want to look to the future and the opportunities presented by the Scottish Parliament for ensuring that our criminal justice system and policing structures will respond as effectively as possible to the needs of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a twin-track approach of retribution and rehabilitation. I have always felt that rehabilitation rates are the measure of a criminal justice system's success. Failure with respect to reoffending rates means that the system is failing, no matter how many people are passing through the courts, or being convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The Scottish Parliament offers exciting opportunities and will be able to set a national agenda to make all our citizens feel safer in their homes, streets and work places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficult topic of sex offenders has been raised. There is perhaps no more contentious issue at present than that of how society deals and will deal with them. A fine balance must be struck between the need to rehabilitate them and the need to protect people from those who have put themselves beyond the pale. The Government have made interesting proposals about the matter, which will eventually have an impact on every community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the plans for extended post-release supervision of offenders and the introduction of sex offender orders, to prevent known paedophiles from frequenting playgrounds and other areas where children are likely to be, but that is only part of the solution. On Second Reading of the Crime and Disorder Bill, I questioned the Home Secretary about the possibility of life-long supervision for sex offenders and the idea that for some categories of sex offender that would be the only answer. He kindly wrote to me afterwards. I know that it is currently maintained that the maximum should be 10 years, but I hope that the Government will reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to rehearse all the issues that are likely to be raised on Monday or Tuesday night in the Chamber. However, we should consider the importance of a nationwide strategy for dealing with the problem of prisoner release for sex offenders. The strategy should not simply be to move sex offenders from one town to the next. National co-ordination will be needed to ensure that local authorities, the police and public agencies work together for offenders to be released into the most appropriate setting—not just given the bus fare and left at the prison door. That will require a stronger post-release monitoring and support network, to maximise public confidence that wherever offenders settle there will be little opportunity for them to reoffend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public confidence is the key to much of what we have discussed this morning. That emerges most clearly from the concern that has been expressed about policing in the community. There is little doubt that the public want more bobbies on the beat. Manned police stations and regular patrols, by foot or car—though most people prefer police to be on foot or perhaps on bicycles—give a feeling that help is close at hand and that the police are acting as a deterrent to crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most unfortunate trends in policing over many years, which many hon. Members will recognise, is the reduction in manned rural police stations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady recognise that one problem is that, statistically, if the Government are forced to hone clear-up rates and other things, professional advice may be that having
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
bobbies on the beat is not the best approach, although we know that they perform an extremely important function in reassuring the community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most people accept that there is incongruity between public perception and what the police claim is the reality of what they do. But, on such issues, public confidence is paramount, so if it means playing a little to perception, so be it. The reduction in manned rural police stations has caused great concern in my constituency and, I suspect, throughout Aberdeenshire and other rural areas—as well as in the commuter villages of the central belt. Few issues cause more concern, or bring people to constituency surgeries faster, than a threat to a local police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) has left the Committee because I was about to mention a scheme that has operated in his part of Scotland for the past two years. It has recently been extended in an attempt to fill the gap left by the closure of rural police stations. The Dumfries and Galloway force has used mobile police stations to ensure a regular presence in many smaller villages and hamlets in that area. I understand that the initiative has been immensely popular with the local community. The mobile stations make about 80 visits each month to smaller communities. The initiative is well worth considering for other parts of Scotland. It is the type of initiative that would encourage public confidence and remove some of the fears of communities left without a permanent police presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are undertaking a review of the structure of the police service in Scotland, and final decisions will rightly be taken by the Scottish Parliament. However, it is important at this stage to emphasise the genuine fears that mergers involving the smaller Scottish forces could result in a further loss of police presence in rural areas. A recent audit of police authorities performance suggested that smaller police authorities operated far more efficiently than some larger ones. It is important to remember that big ones not always mean better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept fully that further loss of police presence in rural areas may not come as a result of reorganisation, but I must emphasise at this stage that it should not. There should be no further diminution of police services in rural areas on account of reorganisation. Proposals for restructuring the police should not result in the creation ultimately of overly urban-focused superforces, which I suspect would lead to a greater loss of public confidence and feelings of alienation from decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important matter is the rapid growth of closed circuit television. Applications are increasing—the Minister told us that a further 23 applications have been approved along with the 60 that have already gone through. Many have come at the instigation of communities themselves. I must sound a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
warning note here because if this takes off across Scotland we shall be embarking on the most extensive surveillance of the civilian population ever—even during war time. There is no doubt that it is having a good effect on crime rates but, effectively, it is also surveillance of civilians. We must not lose sight of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in CCTV has been fuelled partly by the public's desire for what they regard as second-best to the bobby on the beat. I feel sure that if the police presence were more widespread, the demand for CCTV would probably not be so great. Much of the new growth of CCTV in smaller towns and villages has come about because of the reduced police presence, but we should not ignore the genuine anxieties about the extension of the use of CCTV. There is a question of civil liberties, and the fear that displacement of crime will occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases, CCTV has been a success; crime rates are lower and public confidence is higher. However, we must regulate the use and spread of CCTV. The Scottish Parliment could play a proactive role in that, and legislate to prevent the abuse and misuse of CCTV, introduce necessary safeguards and monitor the spread and effectiveness of the technology. The police are unlikely to object to such a measure; they might broadly welcome it, because it would deal with some of the cowboys who are moving into the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parliment may also have an opportunity to ensure more sustainable funding for CCTV through mechanisms such as rate relief for businesses that contribute annually to the running costs of the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) about violence against women. Community safety must cover security in the home as well as on the streets. The issue of violence against women is connected to the debate on neighbours from hell. The Scottish National party has a charter for action on violence against women, and, during the election campaign, I was happy to endorse the zero tolerance justice pledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we must turn words into action. Education and prevention must be accompanied by shelter and support services and effective prosecution mechanisms. I welcome initiatives such as those pioneered by Fife council to establish specific domestic violence units, which combine the expertise of the police and social work departments, to deal exclusively with domestic violence. The most recent figures show a higher number of prosecutions for domestic violence in the region and help to create a fuller picture of the frequency and extent of such violence. Much domestic violence is unreported, and sometimes hospital admissions are the only real measure of the incidence of domestic violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The Minister will consider domestic violence in a major conference later this week in Scotland. There is significant cross-party consensus on the matter. We agree about the need for emergency residential accommodation, safe homes, crisis telephone lines, education at school and in the work place and improved training of the police and other emergency services to ensure that they recognise cases of abuse and handle them sensitively. The same protection should be offered to all-male and female, married and cohabitating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When gaps and weaknesses exist in the provision of services, especially in rural communities, we must consider new initiatives for providing advice, assistance and escape routes for the victims of violence. The Scottish Parliament can work with local authorities and the police to ensure a minimum national standard and a best practice framework for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about inconsistent funding for Women's Aid refuges for example. Local authorities have to make difficult decisions about budgets, and different cuts are made in different parts of Scotland. There should be consistency throughout Scotland in funding services that deal with domestic violence. We may have to consider central funding for the support organisations that do such a fundamental job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP broadly welcomes the proposal to allow local authorities to apply for anti-social behaviour orders to protect communities from so-called "neighbours from hell". The current process of eviction and action against disruptive neighbours can be slow and cumbersome, and does not instil confidence in communities that are terrorised by individuals or families. The new mechanisms will offer more flexibility. However, several points should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not encourage creating social pariahs, or outcasts from society. An effort must be made as part of the process to promote community dialogue and create mechanisms for resolving disputes. Equally importantly, the law must recognise the substantial difference between bad neighbours and neighbours with what could be described as an alternative lifestyle, who do not necessarily fit in. I see a growing reluctance in society in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom to tolerate people whose lifestyles are not the same as the rest of us, whether they be travelling people or whatever. We should be a mature enough society to deal with the fact that some people will choose different ways of living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that we should perhaps encourage the Government to promote mediation services? Often, if a breakdown between neighbours can be mediated, it will not escalate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I shall briefly refer to mediation groups, which are important. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Government legislative proposals go only part of the way. Constructive initiatives are coming from local authorities, such as housing investigation teams which draw together the expertise of the police and other agencies and can look into neighbourhood disputes and thus protect those who might otherwise be too scared to report anti-social activity. Such teams also work closely with mediation groups. Some of that is already beginning to happen to try to resolve areas of tension before it becomes necessary to go to law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments always like—this is not a gibe at the present Government—to grab the easy headline by appearing to act tough, but we must be careful not to unbalance the approach to the detriment of the welcome initiatives that are developing across the country. I should like to address the Government's other proposals to deal with the undoubted problem of racially motivated crime in Scotland. We have been complacent in the past about that problem. People assumed that it was confined to inner-city areas in places such as Birmingham or Liverpool and that Scotland remained immune, but some Scots daily face racially motivated taunts, petty crime and violence simply because their background differs from that of the majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish National Party has a series of well-defined and effective proposals for tackling racism in Scottish society based on the three pillars of education, support and effective punishment. It is part of our underlying philosophy to create a new Scotland where racial, national or religious bigotry is tackled at its root. In that light we welcome the Government's proposals on racially motivated offences. The Government's plans must surely be about building confidence in minority communities that racially motivated offences will be vigorously investigated and harshly punished. There must be no hiding place for the bigots. I should like to see such legislation extended to all hate crimes whether based on race, nationality, religion or sexual orientation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the comments of the hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife, who talked about Scottish law in this regard. Again we return to the question of public perception and consistency. It is important for us to respond to what people want. We may know in the purest sense that our legal system ought to be able to deal with these matters. Although there has been a problem with consistency in the past, the difficulty is the public perception of these issues. Specifically designated crimes allow patterns of behaviour to be tracked in a schedule of previous convictions and sentenced accordingly, which is not easy to do at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community safety is really about tying together all the various strands of public concern and building confidence in the systems we put in place to protect or to punish. It is as much about local initiatives to tackle vandalism through education as about grand strategies, such as the so-called zero tolerance campaign, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
tackle crimes that affect the quality of life of most of our citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke at a recent risk awareness conference set up by Perth and Kinross council, which takes very seriously risks to personal safety in the work place, in school buildings, from members of the public and from within employment. The issue of community safety is so wide ranging it can take into account all those strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced proposals that seek a legalistic solution to the problems. Although that must be part of the strategy, it does not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have highlighted local initiatives that have been successful on a small scale and that could be extended nationwide. They show the effectiveness of coordination of effort and importance of dialogue. It is in such areas that the Scottish Parliament can play an effective role. It will have the time and energy to examine exciting new schemes and ideas, to assess and develop proposals and to come up with strategies that can be adopted country wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of constant legislation. A crime Bill every year is not the answer. We suffered badly in that respect under the previous Government. Such Bills often become part of the problem instead of being a solution. It is a matter of effective, scrutinising committee structures and good liaison with community groups, councils and the emergency services. It is about a Parliament that is in tune with people as opposed to one that is more that 400 miles away and sometimes appears as though it is on a different planet. That is why the Scottish Parliament will make a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.56 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask four questions. First, I understand that the Minister recently had meetings with the Prison Officers Association. Will he report on the concerns of the secretary and deputy secretary of the Scottish POA, because many of us are extremely uncomfortable—I put it no higher—with the number of people who remain in Scottish prisons? The morale of prison officers is crucial to effective policies in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I was interested in what the Minister said about alarms. I understood him to say that some attention would now be paid to the number of false alarms. Anecdotally, I suspect that some alarm companies operating commercially are not employing highly technically qualified people. From what I have heard in complaints from my constituents, I would go as far as to say that some alarm companies engage in charlatan practices. I welcomed the tone of the Minister's opening speech, but will he spell out what he meant by paying some attention to the problem of false alarms? It is a serious matter when the fire brigade covering Grangemouth is called out three times in one night to answer false alarms. The problem
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
is serious, but what we do about it is altogether more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Minister heard me ask about DNA testing, and I would welcome a letter from him. Is DNA testing and the way that science increasingly impinges on court action creating problems for the courts. Again anecdotally, I understand from lawyers that there are real problems. I do not know how they can be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, as we are on the subject of crime, I wish to refer to the decade's worst crime. This is not the occasion to go on about Lockerbie, but I have a simple question. On Thursday, the Foreign Secretary is meeting the Secretary General of the Arab League to discuss precisely this matter. As the Minister knows, the Crown Office is perpetuating a situation that admits of an untruth. On Monday, I asked the Prime Minister if he would show the evidence held by the Crown Office relating to the destruction of Pan Am 103 to a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary for scrutiny. His answer was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will reply to the hon. Member shortly."</p></blockquote>
On 21st December, it will be 10 years since that extraordinary crime was committed. The normal legal rules might not quite apply in that situation, which had unique and tragic characteristics. However, would the Minister and the Crown Office at least consider submitting the evidence which they say they have to a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary? When I made that suggestion during one of my 14 Adjournment debates on the subject, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were described as "sundry third parties". In that context, Lord Clyde and Lord Hope of Craighead are not exactly "sundry third parties".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are deeply concerned about these matters. It would be a good thing for them if the evidence, which the Crown Office claims to have, was submitted to the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary with the following questions: is there a prima facie case; and is the Crown Office being reasonable in holding such evidence, on legal grounds, for nearly a decade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the welcome given to the paper and to the Government's statement by my colleague, the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith). Ideas about partnership and co-operation for safer communities are close to the hearts of Liberal Democrat Members and are entirely in line with our thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that yet another new body might operate in the community without adequate liaison with existing groups. To prevent crime, we need to bring together in a more wholehearted way than hitherto the powers of housing, education, employment and health. We also need to involve people who deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
with problems related to drugs and alcohol, and the police and youth workers, in all aspects of their work. There must be a much better focus on the matter. One of the ills of the British way of doing things is to compartmentalise everything; we must combat that tendency and look at matters from a community angle. We need to improve the ability of communities to sort themselves out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tend to groan when we mention resources, but they are fundamental. The Government talk a good game, but they do not always play a good game. They are perhaps more Ally McLeod than—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ally McCoist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone can fill the gap with a favourite manager, who can actually deliver. This afternoon, we shall see whether we can add another name to that list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of resources is fundamental. There is not much point in putting more money into a laudable new scheme if there is not enough existing money to maintain the activities that have suffered during the many years of cuts in local government and other services. Unfortunately, those cuts are being continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community eduction can play a vital role in preventing crime and in creating communities that have confidence in themselves. However, in many councils, community education has either ceased to exist, or has been emasculated. Many community groups working with adults, young women, the old, the young or the unemployed have suffered cuts. Our system of urban aid works to help groups get up and running, but their money is then often cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, citizens advice bureaux, which play an important role in helping people to sort out their affairs, have been severely cut in many local authorities and no longer provide the service that they used to—despite being fundamental pillars of the community. It is important for the Government to continue to support such existing pillars of the community as well as producing new pillars—otherwise there will be a forest of pillars with no roof to support. Resources for existing activities are fundamental; new, highly praised initiatives cannot be a substitute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many community groups can help to deal with other problems such as domestic violence, racial and sexual harassment or recurrent football violence. The fact that football violence is causing more problems in another country rather than in Scotland at present does not detract from the need to take preventive measures against its revival in Scotland. Taking action in the community and gaining the support of community groups represents one of the best means of achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, no one has yet tackled the problem that causes more crime than any other in Scotland—booze. Because many of us drink alcohol to varying extents,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
we tend to shy away from the issue. It is considered part of the Scottish way of life for young Scottish males to get "blootered"—if that is a 	<i>Hansard</i> word: I am not even sure how to spell it, but I am sure that 	<i>Hansard</i> will help me. At least I know what it means and for the benefit of any future readers of Hansard, it means drunk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More than drunk!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the greater knowledge of some of my colleagues on this matter. It means completely drunk and totally legless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman implying that he has never been blootered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the fifth amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, Scottish men getting out of control through drink is often viewed as an acceptable part of the Scottish way of life. We should acknowledge that that can lead to unacceptable violence and we should tackle youth drinking far more seriously than we do. It can be a more serious issue than youth drugs. That is not, of course, a reason to neglect youth drug taking—we should tackle it—but excessive youth booze must also be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have any panaceas and I do not propose to become a teetotaller, but we should encourage more modest drinking. Edinburgh and other cities now have a youth café, which encourages young people to socialise in a pleasant environment without alcohol. That sort of positive approach could help to tackle the problem. In addition to the initiatives announced by the Minister and some of the other useful points made in speeches, we must take excessive drinking more seriously. Otherwise we shall not succeed in our objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Osborne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments and what has been achieved in the past year. I also welcome the comments made on both sides of the Committee—we have had a constructive debate. It is obvious that everyone has the right to live in a safe and secure community, but too often that is not the case. The definition of community safety in the "Safer Communities Through Partnerships" document is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"protecting people's right to live in confidence and without fear for their own safety or the safety of other people."</p></blockquote>
I support the hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) on the question of violence against women and children, because it occurs every day on the streets of every community in Scotland. I know that the Minister has been working on this matter and that it is a Government priority. I should welcome an update on progress. I agree with the hon. Member for Perth that the time has come to develop a national strategy for funding organisations that deal with domestic violence. Provision is variable throughout Scotland and we have reached a stage at which that
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
needs to be dealt with nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of how to deal with known paedophiles is obviously serious, but in some ways more serious is the question of the paedophiles whom we do not know about and never get to know about. Most children who are sexually abused are abused by a trusted adult who is known to them. More attention needs to be paid to that issue and to encouraging relevant children and adults to come forward. Progress has been made, but more should be done. In particular, greater public education should take place about the fact that paedophiles are not just people outwith the normal structures of society, but, quite often, are so-called respectable members of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that it is very important to get across to colleagues or relatives of such abusers that during a police investigation, it is in the interests of the abuser to acknowledge what has happened? Also, they should give the police whatever evidence they can to enable the police to bring the matter to court. That approach helps abusers, to confront the crime. Until that happens, they will only enter a cycle of worse offending and do more harm to society and themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Osborne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree. One of the problems of encouraging survivors of sex abuse to come forward is the poverty of understanding both about the processes of abuse, and about the frequency of cases in which victims are trapped in the same home as the person committing the abuse. The problem does not have easy solutions, but it must be acknowledged that in the majority of cases abusers live with the children they abuse.

Education has a crucial role in the prevention of domestic violence. Research has shown that young men even today regard it as acceptable in some circumstances to use violence towards their partners. Until long-term change to those attitudes is achieved, it will still be necessary to deal with violence against women. Reference has been made to the attitudes of Scottish men, but the problem is not confined to them. Macho politics and macho attitudes to women exist throughout the world, I am afraid, and alcohol is only a part of the problem. Many of the people involved do not drink or take drugs or other such substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to non-custodial sentences, community service orders and supervised attendance orders have been used to great effect in my constituency. If we are to encourage young men to get away from a criminal existence, we must increase opportunities for them, while getting them to confront their behaviour. I should like the Minister to comment on the opportunities for non-custodial sentences for women. Compared with men, women are imprisoned for very minor offences and that is not a constructive approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former local councillor, I share the Minister's experience of anti-social behaviour and know how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
debilitating the problem can be for those subjected to it. I am sceptical when it is categorised as minor. There is a range of anti-social behaviour, from noise nuisance to extreme violence. Councils experience great difficulty in dealing with the problem because adequate remedies are not available. I accept that community safety orders raise civil liberty questions, and I would like to know how in-between behaviour, which is neither trivial nor serious, can be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Society does not take racism seriously, and I welcome the measures for dealing with racially motivated offences. I also welcome the Minister's announcement about prioritised crime prevention in areas where crime is concentrated. I congratulate Strathclyde police on the Spotlight initiatives, which have tackled the serious problem of public perception of increasing crime and specific problems such as drinking in public places by those who are under age, and domestic violence. They are excellent initiatives, and I hope that they will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Victim Support and similar agencies will continue to receive funding. I was interested to hear about the initiative that the hon. Member for Perth described for providing mobile stations in rural areas. That is an excellent idea, which is worth further exploration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe) envied the fact that Ayr had received support for CCTV. I can confirm that it has been popular and effective in the town centre, and has been extended to other areas. Again, I accept that there is a civil liberties argument. Indeed, a constituent made the point to me. However, that argument must be balanced with the obvious advantages to my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the pilot speed limits, but more resources are needed for traffic-calming measures, especially in the densely populated communities that the Minister described. Such measures are also needed in towns such as Prestwick, which is in my constituency and has major problems of speeding, and motorists using quiet streets to avoid the town centre. That has caused local anger and should be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An effective community safety project in my constituency has taken practical measures and involved local people in, for example, educating school children about crime prevention. It also provides house alarms for houses that have been broken into and generally promotes a safe and secure community. The project has been so successful that it has been extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I especially welcome the Minister's emphasis on the need for a co-ordinated effort and the acceptance that social exclusion and poverty play a major part in crime. Compared with the previous Government's attitude towards tackling crime, a sea change has taken place. I welcome that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Community safety is important to all my constituents. Therefore, I am pleased that the Government attach such importance to it, and view it as a key part of their modernisation agenda. I especially welcome the proposals for anti-social behaviour orders, sex offender orders and the power to confiscate noise making equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's proposals for dealing with the underlying causes of crime by promoting social inclusion, and their holistic approach to urban regeneration, which considers health, housing, economic development and crime prevention together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the Minister's emphasis on multi-agency co-operation, which is manifested in urban regeneration partnerships, and the partnerships for crime prevention that the booklet outlines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent an Edinburgh constituency. The city has had a successful community safety partnership for some time. The partnership has produced an action plan and has conducted research that emphasises the gender dimension highlighted by my hon. Friends the Members for Ayr (Ms Osborne) and for Glasgow, Maryhill and by the hon. Member for Perth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will comment briefly on the research. Some 1,000 women in Edinburgh were interviewed, half of whom had been assaulted. Most of those assaults were by someone known to the woman and took place in a setting familiar to her. That shocking finding is borne out by other statistics. A quarter of reported violent crime, for example, is domestic violence. Given that a lot of domestic violence is not reported, that is a serious underestimate of the scale of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Edinburgh community safety working group examined violence against women in a broader context, which also included sexual violence and child sexual abuse. The latter issue was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research revealed that most violence against women is perpetrated by someone known to the victim. It also showed that women are frightened of being attacked by strangers. Almost 50 per cent. of women felt unsafe walking in the dark and waiting at bus stops at night. The majority said that at night they felt safest in their cars. The Minister is responsible for transport, so I am sure that he will bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, fear of crime is a serious matter that must be examined in relation to transport policy and home affairs policy. The Government are discussing mainstreaming their policies for women. That must be taken into account in promoting the laudable intention of getting people to use public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research highlights problems that we have known about for some time in a graphic way. It reinforces the point made by hon. Ladies in our debate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
that a strategy for women must be integral to the partnerships for community safety. The Minister is attending an important meeting on that on Friday, and I am sure that a lot of discussion will take place about such matters. I know that details will emerge later, but will he comment briefly on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have learned from zero tolerance and from other policies that strategy must be based on prevention, on protection and on provision. The Government have discussed mounting an advertising campaign that deals with the problem of male violence against women. Are there specific proposals for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that they want to be tough on the causes of crime. The general social situation is central to that, but male attitudes to women must be targeted as well. Three weeks ago I attended the launch of the VIP project. A group of nursery school children were there, and they were being taught to say no and to talk openly if they were being abused by adults. Prevention must be examined in a broad way. Protection clearly is the other side of that. We keep being reminded of the shocking statistics. I do not know what the latest Scottish Office figures on rape are, but those I have read suggested that 9 per cent. of reported rapes resulted in a conviction and obviously many are not reported. The recent "Dispatches" programme on Channel 4, which admittedly dealt with England, came up with the horrific figure that only 13 out of 500 reported domestic violence cases resulted in convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have made an announcement on this which I missed, but a loophole emerged in the Protection from Harassment Act 1977 and a stalker was acquitted back in February. Has there been any update on that? Clearly there are a whole series of measures. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities inter-agency guidance is that all people connected with the criminal justice system should receive specific training in this area. Perhaps that suggestion should be taken on board as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne) emphasised the issue of provision for violence against women and the Minister will hear a lot about that on Friday. When an issue is highlighted more people come forward. Referrals to women's aid were up by 16 per cent. last year and that is putting incredible pressure on women's aid provision and on rape crisis centres. There is a problem because at present it is very much at the discretion of local authorities. As part of the general strategy against violence against women we must say something about funding. There are two alternatives: we either have ring-fenced local authority funding or we have an element of central Government funding. Perhaps it is important to say that before the comprehensive spending review is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other angle here is the health issue. It was flagged up as domestic violence in the health Green Paper, and the Scottish Needs Assessment project, in its report, has broadened the definition to violence
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
against women in general. It is a key health issue. I am sure that it is being taken on board and health will be part of the multi-agency groupings that are dealing with this. It is good that the Government have flagged this up as a priority and clearly Friday's meeting is of great importance in driving forward the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should just like to mention one final suggestion from Zero Tolerance—that a panel of experts should perhaps be set up to oversee the policy here. There is a fund of expertise out there which the Government should tap into. Anything that the Minister can say by way of an update would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we must put to rest the unfair analogy drawn by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie). He suggested that the Government talked a good game but did not play a good game. Our position is clearly that we do both. The reference to Ally McCoist interested me. If he was talking about the Government's excellent game he might have been talking about Ronaldo, Romano, Beckenbauer or Pele. I am willing to leave it at that, on the understanding that that was the kind of comparison that was being made rather than anything more derogatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The appropriate parallel with Ally McCoist, surely, is that it would be a star who did not make the final hurdle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a road that I am definitely not going down. We wanted to clear that up. It is a sensitive time for Scottish football supporters, especially in view of today's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a genuinely constructive debate. A consensus is emerging around the Government policies. Clearly it was correct to raise the questions of resources and of emphasis. However we are pursuing a policy that is in line with the needs and aspirations of the Scottish people and that recognises the strength of community participation in pursuing and preventing crime. It also takes on the high-tech aspects of policing that are at the heart of modern police forces. In certain key areas, such as sex offending, the policy acknowledges that a useful start has been made, but that an awful lot more must be done to ensure that the public are and feel protected from the evils that lurk in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on sex offenders, one important issue was missed. It relates to what happens before an alleged offender is brought to trial. My hon. Friend will be aware of cases where an alleged sex offender has been investigated by the police, the case has been passed on to the procurator fiscal and the Crown believes that there is a serious case to be answered. The alleged offender is then given bail but, because of a series of postponements, is left in the community for more than a year. One such case has taken place in my constituency and the victims of the alleged child
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0828">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
abuser are terrified of the consequences of his being left at large in the community. Is my hon. Friend aware of that case and do the Government plan to do anything about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of it. Two similar cases have also occurred in my constituency in recent weeks. Offences have been committed, the alleged perpetrators have remained in the community and anxieties have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are aware of the problem. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with the Lord Advocate and with the Crown Office and we want to approach the problem in two ways. First, we shall question whether alleged offenders should be in the community. Secondly, if they are in the community, we will try to ensure that the courts deal with them as quickly as possible. I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are taking the issue seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne) raised the issue of domestic violence, and my hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm) and for Maryhill also discussed it. A major conference is being held on Friday and it will take a step forward by agreeing a common definition of domestic violence. That has never been done before in Scotland. We also need comprehensive and consistent information on domestic violence from police forces and organisations throughout Scotland. We currently do not have that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report was published earlier this year showing the need for a comprehensive range of services in every part of Scotland for women and children who are subject to this most abhorrent crime. Two hundred delegates will be attending the conference on Friday and it will be the final opportunity before we, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith pointed out, produce a nationwide strategy in the autumn to deal with domestic violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Domestic violence is an abuse of male power and it reflects the ugliest aspects of Scottish society. We need to crack down hard on it. That requires a collective effort and partnership, and the community must be involved. We are making a genuine commitment to move forward as quickly as we can. So between June and the autumn, we hope to put in place a strategy to tackle not only domestic violence, but violence against women generally. Women may be subject to violence not just in the home, but anywhere. If that violence is a product of male power, the culture must change in the long term. However, we shall not wait until then to take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before Monday or Tuesday, the Minister might examine clause 23 of the Crime and Disorder Bill and see whether he can build in protection for a woman tenant who cannot control a visitor because he is someone with whom she has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
in a violent relationship. Clearly the Government would not intend to evict her because of the actions of her visitor even though the Bill would allow the landlord to do that. The clause should allow evictions only when the tenant can control the visitor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that raises the issue that we debated earlier about new provisions for landlords and evictions. I reassure the Committee that such sensitive issues will be picked up in the guidance. We do not want women in difficult circumstances who are already under pressure to have to face further harassment or undue pressure from visitors or landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised several issues, one of which was the recent meeting with the Prison Officers Association. It was the first such meeting for around 12 months: it was constructive and dealt with the serious issues affecting the prison service. The question of prison overcrowding was an important issue on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently the prison population in Scotland is around 6,300—far too high. We agreed with the prison officers that we should take steps to reduce it, consistent with maintaining the discretion of the judiciary to sentence offenders to imprisonment where appropriate. However, we recognise that part of the solution should be the development of alternative sentences to custody. I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow that we shall pursue that objective vigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue raised by my hon. Friend was alarms. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West and Kincardine mentioned the problem of false alarms, but their incidence in Scotland is dwindling. That stems from better education for school children and easier tracing of malicious calls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to my hon. Friend's point about faulty equipment, fire masters in Scotland are presently in discussions with producers over how best to overcome the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that they are talking to the makers of the equipment because faulty equipment is a more serious problem even than malicious calls. Returning to the Prison Officers Association, can we assume that it was reasonably satisfied with the Government's response?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never presume to say that it was satisfied with my response. However, I felt that the meeting was constructive and views were exchanged on several issues including the extent of the prison population. I also made the sincere point that the association could do more effective work in prisons if there were fewer prisoners in them. Overcrowding means that work on treatment and rehabilitation is less intensive than it should be. We agreed about that and we are taking steps to tackle the problem. The number seems to have stabilised, but I cannot guarantee that it will endure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
I raised the issue of alarms because recent fatalities have occurred where alarms were installed but were not working properly. Local authorities are moving to hard wiring of alarms, which overcomes the battery problem. The system works best through a partnership between agencies and individual families so the Committee should send out the message that smoke detectors must be maintained by changing the batteries when needed. No enormous sum is involved but it could make the difference between a young child dying upstairs or living because the fire authorities were able to meet the required response time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member of Linlithgow also mentioned DNA testing. As I said earlier, I would be happy to write to him about the matter. As to Locherbie, my hon. Friend will not expect me to do more than pass his comments and the Official Report to my noble Friend the Lord Advocate, who is the independent prosecutor in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say gently that if I were the Lord Advocate—and Lord Advocates have been involved in the fatal accident inquiry which is now a matter of enormous controversy—I would welcome someone else such as the Lord Ordinary at least looking into what has been bequeathed by previous Lord Advocates who may not have been so certain about the evidence as was first made out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot go further than the point that I have made. I will pass my hon. Friend's comments to my noble Friend, the Lord Advocate. He will be able to consider them in an independent prosecution context and I do not wish to comment further on the matter this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth made some constructive points regarding policing, especially about local police stations. I was particularly impressed by the Dumfries and Galloway mobile police unit. That was a good idea because it was very visual. It is okay to have policing in a Panda car or on the beat, but that unit could be moved around and solved a number of problems. The hon. Lady referred to confidence in the service and the use of the unit tackled that issue. We might wish to develop that idea and we shall look more closely at the situation in Dumfries and Galloway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have told the police that we want a debate about the number of police forces and we shall consult them on that matter. I should not like to think that there will be any link between the number of local, rural police stations and any change in the structure of police force delivery throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. However, we have been given a timely reminder that, in considering large structures, we should be aware that policing is essentially local and that we do not want to sacrifice that aspect of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth also asked whether 10 years would be long enough for post-release supervision. In the Crime and Disorder Bill Committee, we had much discussion of that matter. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
is a tough change. We are considering the application of 10 years supervision to any length of sentence imposed for sex offending. If it is a violent offence, there would be a five-year supervision period but the initial sentence must be of four years or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want to implement those measures and to see what happens. For the first time, there will be a serious consideration of risk assessment when a person comes before the court. That could mean that someone given a sentence of two years in custody might end up with a total extended sentence of 12 years. We must ensure that when the person comes out of prison, supervision is resourced and effective. I reassure the Committee that we shall examine those matters carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about closed circuit television and civil liberties. I am conscious of the need to ensure that whatever we do should acknowledge peoples' rights and liberties and that they should not be undermined. The reaction from the public, community in general, the police and most hon. Members is that closed circuit television is a good thing. It gives people confidence; it detects and reduces crime. We want to develop it further in Scotland, but with the caveat that civil liberties are important and must always be recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Elsewhere my hon. Friend has touched on the debate about whether closed circuit television leads to a decline in crime or whether crime is displaced to another place that is not covered by the system. Do the Government have a target for the amount of coverage of the inhabited parts of Scotland with closed circuit television? I hope that it will not be comprehensive. There must be a limit with a saturation point so that we do not put closed circuit television in every corner of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is well made. We do not intend that there should be blanket coverage, partly because of resource constraints and partly because certain parts of the country would not benefit. However, the projects have proved of significant benefit in the areas in which they operate. I should like to make the point—and it is not a political one—that Angus council has an enormous project for towns that are not large. However, that project has reduced crime figures and, importantly, from the evidence that we have, it does not displace crime. There was always the fear that if cameras were put in one spot, the young people or adults who commit crime would move elsewhere. Although that does not seem to have happened, we are well aware of the problem and will keep it in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth's final point was about anti-social behaviour orders. The orders will be for the top tariff of families from hell. The Government want to explore every other avenue before we get to the point of making a civil order in court, a breach of which could be a criminal offence leading to a serious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
fine or imprisonment. Mediation is a crucial part of the process. I would hope that most local authorities would try other things before invoking an anti-social behaviour order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill raised several issued concerning building standards and insulation. It is important to ensure that standards continue to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that road speeds of 30 mph can kill. No matter how much we reduce the speed limit dangers can arise and people can be killed—event at 20 mph. The Government and local authorities can do so much, but individual drivers should be aware of the circumstances in which they are driving and exercise due caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has also been very active with respect to domestic violence. She will recognise that we have made progress, although not as much as she would like. On Friday we shall take the matter much further. We are determined to stamp out this abuse and to change the culture in the longer term. We want to make progress and work in conjunction with all the organisations concerned. On Friday, not only the Convention of Scottish Local authorities but the Scottish health board and the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme will be concerned with the idea of partnership, which is serving us well in many respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before leaving the question of offences directed against women, will the Minister answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith about the difficulties that arose in the courts in February, with respect to stalking, and anti-harassment orders? The courts interpreted the law in a way other than Parliament, I think, intended. Has any progress been made on amending the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Progress has been made. Discussions were held involving Ministers, the Lord Advocate and the courts' administration. I think that some steps have been taken towards dealing with the issue, within the courts' administration procedure. We were left with a choice: further legislation to close the loophole, or administrative action to avoid that. I shall write to hon. Members to explain matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine raised several points. As to local councils, we want them to be at the centre of the community strategy. I appreciate that broad changes are taking place in local government and that there may be others in future, but it is crucial that people who represent local interests should be involved in the strategy. The McIntosh committee, which was established to examine the interface between the Scottish Parliament and local government, will make recommendations. We want a solid relationship to be established between
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
the new Parliament and local government, whether that concerns community safety, health or education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Co-operation is also in evidence in projects for young people and in matters of youth justice. A Cue Ten project in Glenrothes is run by Apex, and the Freagarrach project in the Central region is also trying to ensure that young people are confronted by their behaviour. I am convinced that local authorities working with the voluntary sector are best placed to tackle some of the major issues that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the recruitment of retained fire-fighters, we are trying to tackle a backlog of problems throughout Scotland. I am not happy about some of the matters affecting the fire service there. In the highlands and islands or more rural areas in, for example, Argyll, there is a need for renewal of capital equipment. An extra £1 million investment is needed in Highland region. The Government recognise the problem and want to tackle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police do an excellent job, with respect to noise making equipment, given the challenge and the necessary legislation, they will respond. However, common sense is needed. Noise-making equipment is a real scourge of communities, and enormous demands will be made on the police in this respect when the Bill is passed. I hope that the use of the measures will be restrained; if they are used wisely, they will achieve the desired effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of drug treatment testing orders has been raised. The drug treatment testing order in the Crime and Disorder Bill is not designed to remove resources from front-line drugs treatment and rehabilitation. That is a complex and growing problem. However, the order affords a genuine opportunity to provide an alternative to custody for those for whom criminality is not the main problem. They feed their habit by abusing drugs, by stealing, and by getting involved in theft and robbery. Thus I can give solid reassurance on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to deal with most of the issues that have been raised. As I said earlier, we have had a good debate. In the spirit of openness operated by the Scottish Office, I invite hon. Members who have concerns about issues—whether local or national—to contact the Department. We do not have a monopoly of wisdom on the issues that have been raised today, and we are willing to accept that local intelligence can help to shape our policies. That is an open invitation of hon. Members to provide such information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, it has been defended by the chief executive of the Scottish prison service, Mr. Eddie Frizzell, on the ground that it is legal.

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[Mr. McFall.]</p>
	<p>12.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate the important subject of diabetes. It is especially important as national diabetes week has just ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Debates about diabetes and screening are neither obscure nor academic. They are central to what the national health service in Scotland is trying to achieve. We should all be anxious about the growing problem of diabetes. I will outline the reasons for that anxiety and argue that a targeted, selective high-risk screening programme is the way forward. Such a programme would have the benefit of preventing the suffering and complications caused by diabetes and would lead to better planning and commissioning of national health service resources in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My personal interest in diabetes is twofold. A member of my family, now in his sixties, lost the sight in one eye as a result of complications from diabetes. After the general election my hon. Friend the Minister and I visited the Roigmore hospital in Inverness, where a diabetes centre had just opened. A diabetes nurse informed me of the complications in diabetes and that stimulated me to raise this issue today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is diabetes? The British Diabetic Association is the voice of diabetics and their families in the United Kingdom. That association, which was set up by H.G. Wells and R.H. Lawrence, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Diabetes is the result of impairments in the body's normal abilities to produce or use insulin. This natural substance is vital for control of blood glucose levels. People with diabetes are vulnerable to various forms of long-term damage to their blood vessels and vital organs."</p></blockquote>
Let us consider the effects of diabetes. It is the major cause of blindness in under-65-year-olds in Scotland, 50 per cent. of all non-traumatic lower limb amputations are due to diabetic complications, and the incidence of heart disease and strokes is two to three times higher for diabetics than for the rest of the population. Also there is increased perintal mortality among babies of women with diabetes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incidence of diabetes is likely to double by
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
2010, because of the age and weight profile of the population in Scotland, which has the second highest incidence of diabetes in the world—that shows much about our lifestyle. In the United Kingdom, where 1.4 million people suffer from diabetes, the treatment of the condition and its complications costs the national health service £2.1 billion per year. The figures break down to 2,000 people suffering from diabetes in every constituency in Scotland. At least 100 people who suffer from diabetes work in the Palace of Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Diabetic Association suggests that a further 1.4 million people in the United Kingdom have undiagnosed diabetes. In my constituency and neighbouring constituencies in the highlands, that would mean that more than 3,000 people are currently undiagnosed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider international co-operation. The Saint Vincent declaration was adopted by 32 countries and attempts to tackle diabetes internationally. The United Kingdom adopted it in 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two types of diabetes. Type I develops earlier in life and sufferers tend to be dependent on insulin. Type II is known as maturity onset, or non-insulin diabetes mellitus and 80 per cent. of diabetics suffer from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Screening for type II is vital. It requires planning, and should tackle local needs in a national framework. The key is targeting. I do not suggest random or mass targeting—that would not work and the BDA does not support it. It is not viable because of the work load and the number of false positives that would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should view screening as a form of prevention rather than cure. Screening would allow GPs to offer patients who are most at risk—those who are over 40, who have a family history of diabetes, or are overweight—the chance of early detection, which is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BDA says that most diabetics suffer from their condition for between three and seven years before diagnosis. Early detection will reduce patients' suffering from complications and reduce costs. That can be done through a simple, inexpensive urine test, which takes up to 30 seconds. I accept that no perfect diagnostic test exists, but the positives are important. A GP who detects diabetes through a urine test can follow up the findings with a blood test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DBA sponsored a King's Fund survey, which discovered that 90 per cent. of type II sufferers were detected through a simple urine dipstick test. Despite a number of false positives, that is a good percentage for any screening process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, there was a lack of consensus on definitions of diabetes. The World Health Organisation is considering that problem. A lack of awareness of the condition also worked against screening. Nowadays, there is more evidence of the effectiveness of intervention, which strengthens my argument for selective screening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
I proposed early-day motion 699, which called for national screening programmes and was signed by more than 169 Members of Parliament of all parties. That shows cross-party support for a way forward. From my hon. Friend the Minister's replies, the Government are awaiting advice from the UK National Screening Committee. Could we see this as a two-way street? Can we press the Committee for a quick response?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have focused today on type II diabetes. It is underestimated in terms of both public health and public purse. We should spend money early on screening rather than picking up the pieces by spending later when complications have developed. There is a low level of public awareness which again affects self-care and detection. That is reflected in research and purchasing in the health service. It leads to high levels of undiagnosed diabetes which again is perhaps reflected in the poor lifestyle in Scotland, the lack of exercise and the incidence of obesity which will not be helped by four weeks of the world cup. That adds to risks of triggering the disorder, but it is quite clear that type II diabetes is very dangerous and we should be underscoring that. There is no well formulated policy for screening in Scotland at present. Someone once said that the future is not what it was but I believe in a future of public increasing awareness. We should do that through health promotion and self-health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must prevent and treat diabetes through primary care and local specialist diabetes teams such as the Roigmore team, which does a good job. We need to develop targeting to high risk screening. The model developed by Optimal Healthcare Solutions called "Diabetes Disease Management System" is a good example of how that can be explored. In those ways we can tackle with fresh vigour what is sometimes rather emotively called Scotland's silent killer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Sam Galbraith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Steward) on his success in securing this Adjournment debate today. The subject is one in which he takes a keen and diligent interest as illustrated by the lucid, comprehensive and considered way in which he has opened the debate. His knowledge of diabetes would do any undergraduate currently sitting his finals proud. His analysis of types I and II refreshed my knowledge and it was good to hear it from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's perspective. Without boring the vast numbers of people listening to the debate perhaps I could go over some of the issues that my hon. Friend has touched upon. By any standards, diabetes is an important disease not just in Scotland but in the UK as
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
a whole. The Scottish health survey which I published last year found that among the 7,900 respondents the prevalence of diabetes was 1.5 per cent. in both men and women. It is therefore one of our commonest chronic diseases. It is no respecter of age. All groups can suffer from diabetes but, as my hon. Friend said, it becomes increasingly frequent with age so that about one in 10 older people in the UK need care for the disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly in Scotland, our survey showed that prevalence increased with age. For example, among men the prevalence was 2.8 per cent. in those aged 4554 and 4.3 per cent. in those aged 55–64. The corresponding figures for women were 1.7 per cent. and 2.3 per cent. My hon. Friend was right therefore to focus particularly on what he called type II diabetes and what I call mature onset diabetes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of those affected need supervision and treatment for life. Many are likely to experience some limitation in their way of life in the short and long term and may develop serious complications such as heart disease, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy affecting the nervous system, renal disease and, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart attacks, strokes and peripheral neuropathy which causes walking and various other difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs to the NHS are considerable. Diabetic care is costly and about 8 per cent. of the costs of acute hospitals and about 5 per cent. of total national health service costs are attributable to diabetes. For those reasons, it is worthy of our close attention. It is even more worthy of attention because the welfare of the patient is paramount. That must underlie consideration of all programmes in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If time allows, I shall briefly describe how we are dealing with this disease in Scotland, but I shall first deal with the specific issue of screening that my hon. Friend raised. Screening programmes have an important role in improving our health. For example, many women have cause to be thankful for the breast cancer and cervical cancer screening programmes that have been in existence for several years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, however, to consider the limitations of population screening as well as its benefits. Screening is not a diagnostic test; it is applied to apparently healthy people so that a small number with a potential to develop the disease might be diagnosed and receive effective treatment. It is important that screening should confer more benefit than harm on the population by saving lives and avoiding suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help Ministers reach decisions on screening, the National Screening Committee was set up in 1996. It is chaired by Kenny Calman, the chief medical officer in the Department of Health in England, and it includes among its members the chief medical officers at the Scottish, Northern Ireland and Welsh Offices as well as other experts. The task of the committee is to advise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Ministers on the case for implementing new population screening programmes; on screening technologies of proven effectiveness that require controlled and well-managed introduction; and on the case for continuing, modifying or withdrawing existing population screening programmes—for example, any that have been inadequately evaluated or are of doubtful effectiveness, quality or value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To facilitate its task, the committee has developed a framework within which the case for population screening can be considered. It has established criteria that take into account international work and the seminal WHO report produced in 1966. That includes, for example, criteria on the selection of conditions for screening and guidance on the screening itself. It also makes it clear—this is an important point—that there should be effective treatments or interventions for patients identified through early detection and that the screening programme is effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. The committee attaches particular importance to quality assurance and it is developing a strategic framework for evaluating quality assurance arrangements for population screening programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example of the rigorous and careful consideration that the committee brings to its work was its decision to advise Health Ministers last year that a national screening programme for prostatic cancer, with current techniques, was of no benefit and could cause considerable harm. That decision undoubtedly saved the male population from unnecessary, unpleasant and ineffective testing and treatment. I give that illustration because we need to understand that screening programmes are not necessarily beneficial in every case. Each programme must be considered on its merits. There is no de facto reason why screening should always be beneficial. Hence the value of the criteria developed by the National Screening Committee and the framework that it has developed for assessing the desirability of introducing or continuing screening programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will remember that he asked me a question during the Scottish Grand Committee on 2 March this year. I told him then that the National Screening Committee had not yet considered the case for national screening for diabetes but would do so as part of its future programme in the light of emerging evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can update that answer today and I hope that it will help my hon. Friend. The committee's secretariat is actively gathering information from national and international experience of diabetes and the issue is likely to be considered at a meeting of the committee later this year. My hon. Friend will understand why I cannot say any more at this stage. The committee exists to advise Ministers and it would not be sensible or proper for me to seek to pre-empt its views or to offer my own opinion in what is an extremely complex
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
area. My hon. Friend can be assured, however, that matters are progressing and being progressed hard by the committee, which is currently collecting more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of a national screening programme does not mean that no action is being taken. On the contrary, a wide range of activity is taking place, much of it flowing from the Saint Vincent declaration of 1989. The declaration had two general goals for children and adults with diabetes: first, sustained improvement in health experience and a life approaching normal expectation in quality and quantity; and secondly, the prevention and cure of diabetes and of its complications by intensifying research effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Action at both UK and Scottish levels has been considerable. For example, under the aegis of the Scottish inter-collegiate guidelines network, advice has gone out to the NHS in Scotland on variety of subjects, including good practice in the care of young children and young people with diabetes, the management of diabetic renal disease, the management of diabetes in pregnancy, and the prevention of visual impairment. The Scottish Health purchasing information centre has also produced a study on the economic impact of diabetic eye disease and the clinical resource audit group is currently developing advice on the use of information technology to facilitate hospital diabetic systems and computerised registers at regional level. That latter report should be published shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, in pursuance of the Saint Vincent declaration, a wide range of research is currently under way. The Scottish Office chief scientist office is currently funding two major research projects on diabetes costing over £175,000; while the Department of Health in England is financing three research projects on diabetes at a total cost of £1.6 million. At the same time, the Medical Research Council is funding research to the tune of £3 million. Moreover, the clinical resource and audit group will, from this year, be funding three audit projects amounting to £400,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work being undertaken to implement the Scottish diet action plan with its objective of improving the Scottish diet will also have spin-off benefits in relation to diabetes, as increasingly the Scottish population eat more healthily. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the subject of diabetes. I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's position on diabetes, particularly on screening. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured that the Government are making progress as fast as they can on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
