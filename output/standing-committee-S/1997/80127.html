	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries (The Lord Sewel)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to make this statement about the pressures affecting, and the prospects for, Scottish farming. I do so recognising that there is concern about the industry and for the position of hill fanning in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by briefly putting Scottish farming in context. It is one of our basic industries, with a long history and a well-founded reputation for the production of quality primary products. Its gross output contributes almost £2 billion to the economy. It contributes 2.2 per cent. of the Scottish gross domestic product; it directly employs 48,000 people—excluding spouses—and helps to support about twice that number of jobs in other Scottish industries. Because of Scotland's physical characteristics, hill farming is an important part of the industry. It operates where there is often little or no alternative to farming, where employment is scarce and where the countryside is scenically attractive, yet is often at its most sensitive, environmentally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish farming depends heavily on subsidies. In Scotland, where there are about 22,000 full-time farmers, the taxpayer met a bill for a record £500 million in direct subsidies in 1997–98. As can be seen from table 1—[Hon. Members: "Table 1?"]. Table 1 will be circulated in due course and when hon. Members have had the opportunity to consult it, they will see that direct subsidies last year accounted for more than 130 per cent. of farm income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers also benefit from market support, which can crudely be seen as consumer transfers to Scottish farmers. Market price support is invisible, but is nevertheless real, in that it is implicit in the higher price that consumers pay for their food. Measures such as intervention buying and export refunds, and the effects of external tariffs, keep European Union agricultural prices well above world prices and also benefit Scottish farmers in the short term. In 1996, such market support was worth about a further £140 million. As EU prices have come closer to world prices, market support has fallen, but it still remains important for some commodities, notably milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
There is substantial Government support for the industry through the funding of agricultural research and development, towards which my Department alone contributes some £40 million a year. The Government also provided significant financial assistance for marketing farm produce. Livestock farming in our hills and uplands is the sector that is most dependent upon direct subsidies. On average, hill farmers receive about £25,000 in direct support, more than double their average net farm income of less than £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish farming remains an important industry in much of Scotland, helping to maintain the social fabric and providing stewardship of our countryside, yet many of our farmers—particularly our hill farmers—do not rely on the market for their returns. They are heavily dependent on Government subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the pressures affecting Scottish farmers unquestionably the greatest in recent times has been BSE. It has shaken the industry to its core, and its effects can be seen throughout the whole chain, from the primary producer on the hill right through to the consumer. The effects, as many may suppose, are not confined to the beef sector, which long before the appearance of BSE was in structural surplus throughout the European Community. Even without BSE, the beef industry was facing a steady reduction in demand of about 2 per cent. a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other commodities have also felt the chill. Some sectors may have gained a brief advantage from the displacement of beef, but that has not cushioned them from the wider impacts. The fact that the animal disease record in Scotland has been good has, if anything, added to the impact of BSE. The disease has unquestionably set back Scottish farming, with the most vulnerable producers on our hills and uplands feeling the pressure most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden has not had to be borne by farmers along—far from it. The United Kingdom taxpayer has had to meet a hugh bill. Direct expenditure on BSE-related measures to date for the United Kingdom as a whole comes to about £2.5 billion. Over-30-months-scheme payments to producers in Scotland alone already amount to more than £100 million. At present, they run at about £700,000 a week. Although I do not wish to predict the level of BSE-related spending that will be required in coming years, the decline of BSE is likely to have an influence on funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, BSE has had and is continuing to have significant financial impact on farming. However, other financial pressures are also at work. The annual review of farm incomes undertaken by economists and statisticians in my Department will be announced on Friday in a statistical press release. I expect the statistics to show that most Scottish farming, including arable and dairy farming, was significantly less profitable than it has been in recent years. Poorer weather, less buoyant markets and, of course, the strength of sterling all had a bearing on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers are well used to, and indeed accept, the vagaries of the weather. I am aware that yields last year in the cereal sector were down because of difficult harvest conditions. That has meant that arable area payments may have become more significant than they were in the past. By 31 December last year, Scottish farmers had received £124 million under the 1997 arable area payments scheme. A further £20 million or so is due to be paid in respect of the second tranche of oil seeds payments when the Commission announces the final payment rates, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
the remaining 5 per cent. is for cereals, proteins and set-aside. My officials are working hard to ensure that the bulk of those payments are made by the end of March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers also accepts ups and downs in the marketplace, and they are bound to be concerned about current lamb prices. They complain loudly about hardships arising from adverse weather and major downturns in market prices, but, as a rule, they do not complain to the Government. Farmers seem to have a blind sport on exchange rates—a defect from which other industries in Britain do not appear to suffer. Farmers want full agrimonetary compensation, arguing that it is theirs by right. However, they forget that there is no such thing as free money [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Even paying the part that we can reclaim from the EU budget costs the UK taxpayer £71 in every £100 of so-called EU-funded common agricultural policy expenditure in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers also forget that when sterling was weak they benefited considerably—by many hundreds of millions of pounds. No cheques were handed back to those in St. Andrew's house. The over-compensation in cereals and beef as a result of the 1992 CAP reforms, when farmers were given direct payments for anticipated price cuts which failed to materialise, was worth more than £500 million in Scotland between 1993 and 1996. Therefore the case for agrimonetary compensation is not nearly as strong as it may initially appear. Certainly, it is not robust enough to persuade the Government that across-the-board compensation is warranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the specific difficulties confronting beef and sheep farmers, the Government recently announced £85 million of special aid most of which, subject to clearance by the European Commission, can be paid by April. This one-off additional cash injection, of which Scotland's farmers should receive just under 30 per cent. is justified for the following reasons. First, structurally, the beef and sheep sectors in the less favoured areas find it most difficult to absorb and adjust to the changes in income generated by green rate revaluations. Secondly, BSE has restricted the market for Scottish beef and, as a result, extremely valuable export markets have been lost. Undoubtedly, that has had the effect of depressing returns to producers on the home market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, increased amounts of beef have been imported to Britain partly because of the strength of sterling and partly because the over-thirty-months scheme and the calf processing scheme have substantially reduced beef supplies in this country. We took the view that available aid should be targeted at those in most need. In Scotland, that is the primary producer farming in our hills and uplands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another form of financial pressure on the farming industry arises from net costs being passed back to, or charges being levied on, the producer. It has been claimed that such charges do not have to be met by competitors abroad, thus giving them a competitive advantage. I have sympathy with our farmers when genuine distortion of trade arises. However, given the degree to which UK taxpayers and consumers already support farming in this country, it would be quite wrong for them to have to bear directly any additional costs or charges. Moreover, as public expenditure comes under ever greater strain, I expect that other member state Governments, who are not at present following the UK's line of passing back costs,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
will decide to follow our example. As these measures improve the confidence of the consumer in the quality of Scotch beef, the farmer will ultimately benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from financial issues, more subtle pressures face the farmer. Those arise because of society's demand for more welfare conscious and environmentally friendly farming regimes. Beyond the farm gate, the industry has to contend—and rightly so—with ever higher hygiene standards throughout the food chain. Ensuring the safety of food must be paramount. That is good not just for the consumer but for the image and future prosperity of farming. Food safety goes hand in hand with the quality assurance schemes, which are now so much a part of the food scene. That is the best way to secure markets rather than see them being eroded by others who do things in a way that does not provide the assurance that the modern consumer demands. The new Food Standards Agency is a major initiative which we have taken to try to secure that. It represents a large commitment by the Government but I believe it to be likely to produce worthwhile results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, more and more farm-assured products are being demanded, putting pressure on the farmer to supply them. It may be argued that the burden of additional costs arising from those developments should be carried by taxpayer. I reject that totally. There is, in my view, some obligation on the part of the consumer to bear a share of such costs. Failing that, however, the costs can only go back along the chain, and in some cases fall on the farmer, because the measures are in the farmers' interests in enabling them to retain market share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressures that I have outlined must be faced by farmers at present. Other pressures, however, will have to be tackled in the foreseeable future. They will be of even more fundamental importance and will shape the structure of the industry in this country into the next century. First, there is reform of the common agricultural policy. The CAP as it stands at the moment is unsustainable. One has to think only of the dairy regime to see the folly of a system that effectively inhibits an efficient sector from competing in a growing world market. The Government will certainly be exerting maximum pressure for change within the context of the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Radical change is not only in the nation's long-term interests but is also in the best interests of the fanner, including the Scottish farmer. Reform of the CAP will be followed by the next round of World Trade Organisation negotiations, which will, to put it mildly, be uncomfortable for the European Community and seem likely to increase pressure for further reform of the CAP in due course. Finally, there is EU enlargement to contend with in the not too distant future. New countries, with considerable agriculture potential, will join the Community to compete with our home industry. Those three factors mean that if Scottish farmers are expecting the status quo to continue they are in for a rude awakening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the prospects for Scottish farming, clearly a resolution of the ban on exports of Scottish beef to Europe and further afield is very important, not only to the beef producer but to our farming sector as a whole. That explains why the Government are continuing to press hard in Brussels for the ban to be relaxed. Even though it will apply initially to Northern Ireland only, acceptance of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
proposed export certified herds scheme clearly would be a useful first step on which we in Scotland could build. The date-based export scheme, which has been developed since May, is also being considered by the Commission at present and has a much wider application. Progress on that scheme holds out the prospect of much wider access to the export market which will be of particular benefit to Scotland. The ultimate removal of the ban will also give welcome respite to the hard-pressed taxpayer who must bear an extremely hefty financial burden at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking ahead at prospects for Scottish farmers, it is extremely difficult to predict the size and shape of the sector, in ten years time. No doubt some people will take a decidedly depressed view of the future. Certainly, if farmers do not respond positively to the pressures that I have mentioned, that pessimism is likely to be borne out. If, on the other hand, farmers recognise the need to adjust their business practices; if they acknowledge their role as custodians of the countryside and take positive action to safeguard the environment; if they improve their efficiency at all levels and most of all if they heed market signals and produce quality assured produce, then a much more optimistic outcome is in prospect. Adjustment in the size of the agriculture sector, including hill farming, is inevitable, irrespective of the response of individual farmers. I hope that that will lead to a leaner, fitter farming sector. As part of the process of change, there will have to be a transition from heavily subsidised fanning to less dependence on state support. Such a change will have implications for the more vulnerable hill farming sector, and the case for financial aid will need to be carefully assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the part that I envisage the Government playing, not only in tackling current difficulties, the existence of which I acknowledge, but during the transition to more market oriented Scottish agriculture. Farming remains so important to Scotland that there is no question of Government abandoning the farmer. I intend to work closely with farming interests to ensure that rationalisation and restructuring is as painless as possible. I shall continue to support quality-assured Scottish produce, with the emphasis on ensuring that it earns as much as possible in the market. I want to build on our reputation for high quality, primary products by adding as much value as possible in Scotland. I shall not adopt solutions that rely on ever-increasing subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish farmers face major challenges with which I am prepared to help as far as I can, provided that they accept that those challenges can be overcome only by a reduction, not an increase, in their dependence on the state. The period of restructuring is driven by internal and external factors. At the end of that period, I want to see a more competitive, more market responsive and more economically viable agriculture industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask three brief questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned reforming the common agricultural policy. I am worried that initiatives such as the farm retirement scheme, which the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food mentioned on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
22 December 1997, will increase the pace at which people leave agriculture. That is happening at a faster pace in this country than many of our European partners would be prepared to contemplate. We may force the pace of restructuring in this country at a rate unmatched by other European Union countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, can the Minister go into more detail about the precise discussions that have taken place in the European Union about progress on adopting the computerised traceability scheme, the certified herd scheme and the date-based scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, can the Minister outline the work of the Scottish Office or the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on scrutinising imported beef to guarantee that beef imported since 1 January meets the standards that are expected of producers in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the early retirement scheme, other European countries apply the provisions that are available through CAP support. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's point. Several of our European partners do not realise the important implications of the next WTO round. They are, perhaps, trying to defend what is described as a European agricultural identity, which is unlikely to survive the next WTO round. Although Commissioner Fischler is presenting significant proposals, in relation to Agenda 2000, for moving away from production related subsidies, they will not be sufficient to enable us to reach agreement in those WTO negotiations. A period of restructuring lies ahead, not only for Scottish and British agriculture, but for European agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The export certified herd scheme has met with a degree of success. It is a limited scheme which applies in the first instance to Northern Ireland. If the ban relating to Northern Ireland is lifted it will be an important psychological step. The scheme has been endorsed by the standing veterinary committee but it will have to be approved by the European Commission and the Agriculture Council before progress can be made. We cannot immediately look forward to the lifting of the ban in the context of the export certified herd scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The much more generally applicable scheme is the date-based scheme. We have worked on it since we came into office. We did not inherit it; it is a new scheme and we are pursuing it as vigorously as we are pursuing the export certified herd scheme. It has been referred to a special working group in Brussels. It is worth noting that Commissioner Fischler described the date-based scheme as robust and benefiting from the advantage of simplicity which the export certified herd scheme certainly does not.

We announced last year that we were going ahead with a ban on any cattle coming into the country which did not satisfy our conditions on specified risk material. Unfortunately, the Commission decided to postpone that decision on a Europe-wide basis until April. That was completely unacceptable to us and we have imposed that ban from 1 January this year. Obviously we are committed to maintaining the highest possible standards of public health control and will be acting vigorously to make sure that they are enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a great supporter of beef labelling. Once we can establish a fully comprehensive beef labelling system in this country and elsewhere it will be to the undoubted benefit of Scottish beef. It will enable us to indicate source which in this case means a high quality product. That is essential. It is a voluntary scheme that will be implemented in this country from 1 April this year. Anyone claiming a description of beef other than one that can be immediately verified, such as regarding its weight and price, will be required to prove the basis of the claim. British beef would have to be clearly defined as being born, brought up and killed in Britain. We think that we should build upon the voluntary scheme and move towards a much more systematic basis of beef labelling in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's statement was one of the most deeply depressing statements that I have ever heard a Minister make about agriculture since 1983, when I was elected to the House. I am sure that the industry will consider it to be deeply complacent considering the level of the problems that it is facing. To say that the figures that are being produced by his statisticians on Friday will show a significantly less profitable industry, is hyperbole and an understatement. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, I accept that it cannot be both—perhaps the Minister's remark could be described as hyperbolic understatement. I was getting on so well until then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's statement will be seen as the understatement of the decade by the farmers in my constituency. It does not recognise the unique combination of circumstances that the industry is facing. Not as single sector is in profit at present: not beef, lamb, milk, cereals, poultry or potatoes. That is a unique situation and the question that needs to be answered is whether the Government are contemplating some relief to give farmers breathing space. Is the Minister preparing an application for more agrimoney from the green pound compensation scheme, so that farmers can look forward to the next 12 to 18 months with some confidence? The Minister said that the Government are not persuaded that compensation is warranted across the board. If that is the case, what compensation is being considered? If nothing is offered, there will be no farmers left in 18 months to take advantage of a lifting of the beef export ban.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We inherited long-standing problems that had not been tackled by our predecessors. We are tackling those, and the £85 million that we announced last year is virtually agrimonetary compensation targeted at the most deserving and hard-pressed sector of agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that all there is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I often hear it said that £980 million is available for agrimonetary compensation. It is as though there is a free pot of gold and one need only go to Brussels and knock on the right doors for the money to come pouring out. That is not the case. Half of that £980 million would have to be funded by the United Kingdom taxpayer and so would 71 per cent. of the remaining half. To give the impression that there is a Brussels pot of gold is the height of irresponsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned to bring about a restructuring of agriculture—particularly in the hills—so that we can get away from a totally unsustainable position in which there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
are direct subsidies of £24,000 to the average hill fanner, producing for that farmer a net income of only £9,000. There is something fundamentally wrong with such an underlying economic structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble Friend for his general statement. I accept the argument about overcapacity in beef production in Scotland, as well as in the United Kingdom and Europe. Does he agree that we should consider the matter not just quantitatively but qualitatively? Given the high quality of Scottish beef we should consider that and not just quantity in general when we consider reducing capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the ideas that I am keenest to promote is that of quality assured schemes. That is the salvation of Scottish beef production. Because it is a specialist area of farming, based on a suckler herd, and is not dairy beef—and in that it is almost unique in Europe—we must communicate the high quality of the product, and we must do that by way of quality assured schemes. That is what customers demand. If we do that we can be sure of a premium product and can secure a niche in the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is little in the Minister's statement to give me confidence about the future of the farmers and crofters in my constituency, who labour to eke out a miserable living on poor land in a severely disadvantaged area. How will the Minister prevent Scottish farmers from losing their export trade to the Ulster first beef deal? Why is the ban not being lifted for all cattle born after August 1996, and on that basis why was the ban of beef on the bone not just a temporary order, giving at least some hope for the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no indication that Ulster farmers want to move in and steal exports—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is no such intention at all. Northern Ireland agriculture does not have the capacity to do that. Clearly, there are enormous benefits for the United Kingdom in achieving movement on the lifting of the ban. That is the primary objective. I do not understand the logic of saying that the policy is mistaken when the ban has at least been partially lifted. Once we take that important first step, we shall have demonstrated that British beef can be exported with the greatest confidence. We shall follow that up with the date-base scheme, which is far more robust and applies more generally. We were straight in saying from the start that we would advance as robustly as possible both the export certified herd scheme and the date-base scheme. As for the possibility of a temporary ban, we must be led by public health considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is correct. SEAC put forward three options, but the chief medical officer made a decisive observation. He said:

ganglia and in bone marrow. I would be very concerned if any tissues that have been shown to transmit BSE were knowingly allowed to remain in the human food chain."</p></q>
Faced with such advice, no responsible Government could act other than in the way that we did. The ban is health-led and science-based. The Government will review it when the advice from our scientific advisers is such as to justify review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the only paid-up member of the National Farmers Union of Scotland on the Committee. I was intrigued to hear my Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), spending the Liberal penny yet again—this time on agriculture. Does the Minister accept that the Main distortion in the European market for agricultural produce is the export ban on British beef? Will he briefly recap what this Administration have done since we came to power to fulfil the Florence conditions on traceability and on the selective cull? Our actions form an unanswerable case for having the beef export ban lifted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was clear when we came into office that, despite the formal wording at Florence, no agreement on lifting the ban would be reached unless we had computer traceability. The previous Administration took no steps even to start the process of establishing a scheme of computer traceability. We have, and we expect to have it up and running by the end of the spring. That is a considerable achievement in a relatively short time, given the number of cattle movements that must be logged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Little progress had been made on the selective cull before we entered office. It is now proceeding well. In many parts of the country, the full cull has been achieved. We have been making progress and will continue to do so. We have also taken steps with the specified risk material ban to achieve the so-called level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell; 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Fife)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the industry's concerns. If his ministerial duties allow him to attend the National Farmers Union rally on Friday, he will hear not just concerns, but anger and frustration. For example, the Minister knows that arable area payments are restricted to 95 per cent. of the total due until the field identification scheme has been validated. However, the delay in many cases has not been caused by individual farmers, but by administrative procedures in the Scottish Office. Why should farmers be penalised in that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, as the Minister appears to accept that the maintenance of rural communities depends on the contribution that farming makes to the local economy, what measures of restructuring does he have in mind to protect the fabric of the countryside and rural communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last year, we published a consultative document on rural development, which emphasises that it is no longer possible to equate agricultural with rural. The agricultural population continues to decline while the rural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
population increases. That trend shows no sign of decreasing. As a method of retaining the agricultural population, the CAP has failed. The rural population is more diverse, active and healthier than a population that is totally dependent on agriculture. That fundamental change has occurred in the past 10 to 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On arable area payments, we have made 95 per cent. of the payments. The Commission has the authority to insist that no payments are made until the full field register is completed. The hon. and learned Gentleman should be pleased that we have been able to negotiate an arrangement for paying as much as 95 per cent., rather than complaining that we have made only 95 per cent. of the payments. Our farmers do not have to wait without payment until all the fields are registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rally may take place in Edinburgh at the end of the week, but I attended a rally in Methodist Central Hall in Westminster last month. I have taken every opportunity to explain Government policy to Scottish farming leaders and to individual farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for a fascinating statement, which raised many issues of which I was previously unaware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many hon. Members in Committee, my constituency contains few farmers, but many consumers of agricultural products. Can the Minister confirm that the existing price support system costs the average family more than £40 a week? Our increased food prices are higher than those that would pertain on the world market. What will the Minister do about that in the near future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister intend to do about the moral hazard posed to farmers by a dependency culture in which they are obliged to farm for subsidy? That is welfare dependency by another name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What steps have been taken to compare the efficiency of spending on job creation in agriculture with that in other sectors of the economy? The agriculture sector does not seem especially cost effective. What does the Minister intend to do about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that, through reform, we move European agriculture closer to the market so that it can respond to the market's opportunities. The dairy industry provides one of the best examples of the need to do that. There are increasing opportunities for exporting dairy products, especially in the far east and China, but European agriculture has almost no hope of a share in that market because of nonsensical dairy quotas and the support structure of the European dairy industry. Therefore, an extremely efficient industry is frozen out of an expanding world market. That is nonsense. We must develop a system in which farmers cease to farm for subsidy, which leads to the sort of dependency culture that my hon. Friend described, but are rewarded for being innovative, enterprising, and producing what the consumer wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

being undertaken at Scottish ports? Whose inspectors are carrying out the new checks—council inspectors or Ministry inspectors? Have extra inspectors been appointed to undertake the extra work that has allegedly been required since 1 January? My impression, and that of many other people, is that little has changed to enforce the new regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inspection takes place at the port of entry. It is carried out by Customs and Excise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister appreciates that some of us feel that he has rather too much enthusiasm for a unilateral dismantling of farm support when his previous answer acknowledged that it is a Europe-wide problem. Can he assure us that, in his enthusiasm to cut farm support, he will not put us at a disadvantage? The Minister will know that farmers in the north-east of Scotland are assailed on all sides by falling prices, rising costs and the impact of the strong pound. We represent the top-quality end of beef production, which cannot survive without assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some farmers have moved into sheep farming to spread the risk and they now find that, as of 1 January, the restriction on the export of sheepmeat—specified risk material not having been removed—means that the French will no longer accept UK sheepmeat: they want whole carcases. As a result, the French are now turning to Spain. That is depressing the market for sheep to the extent that some farmers are receiving £14 per sheep less than they paid for them a year ago. In that sort of economy, people simply cannot survive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Sewel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Specific points have been raised about exports to France.

	<p>the Committee, he will remember last summer's flooding in Moray. Does he know that in correspondence with me the Scottish Office ruled out the use of European structural funds—and, indeed, direct compensation—to compensate farmers and horticulturists in my area; but advised me that insurance companies regarded crops and livestock as insurable? That advice amazed producers and accountants in my area. Will the Minister name the insurance companies that are prepared to undertake such insurance and say what the premiums would be?</p>

There are some technical difficulties relating to the split between agrimonetary compensation and hill livestock compensatory allowance.

	<p>	<i>Motion made and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that I have no power to impose a time limit on speeches. I appeal to all hon. Members, including Front-Bench spokesmen, to keep their speeches as brief as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.19 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Maxton. I thank my noble Friend Lord Sewel for his statement, which helpfully set the context of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my noble Friend said, Government subsidy to farming in Scotland is £500 million a year—its highest-ever level. I hope that hon. Gentlemen will bear that in mind before they leap to their feet and demand even greater subsidies. Despite that subsidy, it is true that farm incomes have been falling and farmers face a difficult period. The conclusion to be drawn from that is the need for fundamental reform in the industry and in the common agricultural policy. As my noble Friend said in his statement, whatever happens, the status quo cannot continue in the long term. I hope that this morning's debate will help us to focus on the need for reform and on the challenges that it presents; we should not forget the realities that my noble Friend set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.21 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State and the Government for acceding to our request for this debate and for giving us this opportunity to question the Minister. I am grateful to the noble Lord Sewel for coming to the Committee and answering questions, even if his answers and his statement did not always match the expectation and the hope that Scotland's farmers have of him and the Government at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State is responsible for Scottish agriculture and I congratulate him on his first appearance at a Scottish Grand Committee in his ministerial role. He emphasised the need for fundamental reform. Reform of the CAP was part and parcel of every party's manifesto at the general election. To judge from what the Prime Minister said recently about the Government's objectives during their presidency of the European Union, the urgent need for reform seems to have slipped down the batting order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is the immediacy of the crisis facing Scottish agriculture and the fact that, although the CAP may be reformed after the year 2000, the question for many farmers is whether they will ever reach that year. That is why we think that the Minister's statement and answers, which the Under-Secretary so complacently followed up, fail to address the crisis facing Scottish agriculture. One wonders if they have managed to gauge the depth of the crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from a letter that I received at the weekend from the secretary of the Shetland branch of the National Farmers Union. She said:
	<br><q><p>"We have heard of crofters selling their store stock in Aberdeen and receiving a bill for them! This is due to the very poor prices and the associated costs of shipping livestock. In this particular instance, what resources does the crofter have to feed his breeding cattle over the next seven to eight months?"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
That farmers and crofters are selling off stock and being billed for it surely shows the immediacy of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a necessary debate; it is not simply about direct employment in agriculture because it affects all those in associated industries such as contractors, feed suppliers, haulage contractors, builders, auction marts and everyone in Scotland's rural communities. If agriculture fails, it has a knock-on effect on those communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his statement, the Minister gave the number of jobs that directly and indirectly depend on farming. The Scottish NFU would put the number slightly higher than he quoted. Nevertheless, the Minister accepted that many jobs were at stake. That is why it is so disappointing that the Government's response does not match the challenge before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that not all the blame can be laid at the Government's door. The BSE crisis, which is perhaps one of the most important factors, preceded the Government's arrival in office. The independent inquiry that opens today under Mr. Justice Phillips will no doubt allocate responsibility for what happened at an earlier stage. We all know of the serious mishandling of the situation by the previous Government. The Government are now responsible for the handling of the situation. I congratulate them on imposing, as from 1 January, an import ban on specified risk materials and beef products that do not match the high standards required of British producers, but they got it wrong on beef on the bone, and that was shown by customers who went out and bought beef before the ban took effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the possible options that the scientific advisers put to the Government was that they could issue a warning and allow customers to make the judgment for themselves. The point that the Minister did not answer in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) is whether the beef on the bone ban should continue once cattle come on to the market that were born after 1 August 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is self-evident that the measure is likely to be temporary and that there will be no need for it with beef that is no longer possibly infected. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that it would have been better for the beef industry in Scotland to have ended up with health warnings on meat in butchers' shops in Scotland? What would that have done to our prospects of getting the export ban lifted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Beef on the bone is a very selective market. People who knew about the product and were aware of the warnings queued up to buy it before the ban came in on 16 December. We took the view that it should be a matter of customer choice in what is a small part of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to look at three components of profitability for farmers and show how in each-income, Government support and costs-profitability is being squeezed and how the Government have some responsibility and therefore some opportunity to do something about it. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that the figures due out on Friday this week were grossly understated by the Minister in his statement. We all know from the interim figures that farm incomes have drastically fallen in Scotland. The Secretary of State and the Minister will recall that when they visited Orkney
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
fro the Highlands and Islands Convention they were given figures produced by Kirkwall auction mart that showed that farm incomes in Orkney had dropped by 28 per cent. in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the respondents to the recent Trustee Savings Bank survey of agriculture, 94 per cent. said that their business this year was likely to be less prosperous than last year; 4 per cent. saw it as being the same; and only a very fortunate 2 per cent. saw it increasing. The Meat and Livestock Commission's briefing of this month states that
	<br><q><p>"it would be prudent for producers, when making their budgets, not to assume that finished cattle prices will be much above 100p/kg live weight in 1998 and 1999."</p></q>
That pressure on incomes will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incomes reflect the price, which reflects the state of the market. I will not rehearse all the difficulties flowing from the BSE crisis and the export ban, but the Minister talked about a restructuring in the beef industry. Why should United Kingdom beef producers take the whole burden or a substantial part of the burden of restructuring? If there is to be restructuring, what guarantees can the Minister give us that it will not be at the expense of the quality suckler herds? His noble Friend the Minister said that he wanted to promote quality. Scotland has quality beef produce, but how can we guarantee that as a result of this crisis these quality herds will be there in the years leading to the millennium?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us inevitably to the strength of the pound. Imports from France and Germany are 14 per cent. cheaper this year than last year. Imports from the EU member states were up by 50 per cent. in the period from January to September 1997. The strength of the pound and the consequences of that are clearly driving prices down. The reduced value of support payments from the EU means that income is less. Because of the strength of the pound and its exchange rate into ecu, the eligibility of United Kingdom produce for intervention purchase has become less and less. That drives the price down further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In questions to the Minister, there were references to Northern Ireland beef. The Minister was sceptical about whether, if the export ban was lifted on that beef, much of it would come on to the Scottish and other UK markets. There is no export ban on sheep, however, other than in the case raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon, yet it is almost impossible to export sheep at present because of the relative value of the currency. Even if the export ban was lifted for Northern Ireland, the strength of sterling might mean that producers there could not take advantage of that and might continue to compete with Scottish producers in the domestic UK markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we should consider agriculture in a European framework, but it is within Europe that farmers believe that there is so much relative unfairness. In a range of countries—Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Holland and Italy—producers have taken advantage of the agrimoney compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman recognise that the high value of the pound also affects industrial exports? Is he arguing that there should be additional subsidies to all the industries in Scottish constituencies that are penalised by the rise of the pound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the high value of the pound is having a damaging effect on industries in many constituencies. When the Committee met in July to debate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
the impact of the Budget, I drew attention to the fact that the Government had deliberately chosen a policy of higher interest rates and a higher value of the pound, and that that would damage Britain's exports, whether they were in manufacturing or in livestock production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok has missed the point. Other European nations, within a single market, within a so-called common agricultural policy, receive benefits and take advantage of compensation. We are disadvantaged because that compensation is not paid to our farmers. There is no similar compensatory mechanism for our industrial competitors in the European market. There is no fair competition for farm producers in the United Kingdom or in other parts of the European Union. As my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, our farmers are disadvantaged not only in beef production but in a range of agricultural production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the sincerity of the hon. and learned Gentleman's position, particularly given his constituency interests and the need to represent them. Will he explain what the Liberal Democrat party advocates in terms of expenditure and the withdrawal of agrimoney, for example? It is important for the Committee to understand that. I had the impression that the hon. and learned Gentleman and his colleagues felt that the £85 million contribution could almost be swept to one side as though it was unimportant. Will he quantify what the Liberal Democrats propose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that Liberal Democrat Members have dismissed £85 million. Of course we do not dismiss £85 million; it is better than a poke in the eye with a blunt stick. We have already heard from the Minister that the part of that amount allocated to hill livestock compensatory allowances has not yet been cleared by the European Union and we do not know when that money will arrive. The National Farmers Union of Scotland submitted evidence to the Select Committee on Agriculture, pointing out that the additional costs that the Government were about to impose on the livestock sector, as a result of a range of payment requirements, would amount to £27 million for the Scottish beef industry alone. That equates to an additional cost of about £50 for each animal slaughtered and exceeds the headage value of the combined additional suckler cow premium in the hill livestock compensatory allowances announced by the Government on 22 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are taking credit for putting in £85 million, but they are not prepared to take responsibility for the additional costs that will be higher for Scottish livestock producers than the amount that was put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State rightly asked about the agrimoney. Liberal Democrat Members would go much further than the Government. The Government have taken only £60 million of the £150 million available to the beef sector. Ministers argue that they cannot do more because of the Fontainebleau agreement. They say that it would cost the British taxpayer money. In fact, the agreement has saved the British taxpayer money in many years—for example, £1.9 billion in 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a bit like an insurance policy. If one gets a discounted premium for year after year, one may have to pay a higher excess charge when the claims come in. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
claims are now coming in, and it is only reasonable that our farmers are put on an even keel with their competitors in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that the hill livestock compensatory allowance needs to be clarified, and so does the OTMS. The Under-Secretary's remarks about the huge subsidies being given to Scottish farmers will stick in their craw. Farmers see them not as subsidies but as compensation for a market that was destroyed by the actions of Government—not this Government but their predecessors. They neglected farming, not least in the BSE crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the consequences of the OTMS. A beast which was worth £700 before OTMS was announced is now worth £312 maximum. No doubt the Labour party will describe that £312 as a subsidy, but many farmers see it as a loss of more than half the beast's value. Therefore, it is not fair to describe such money as subsidy. Much of it is rightful compensation for actions that have been taken in the interests of public health. The Government's decision on OTMS is one of the most serious that they have taken. At a stroke, it halved the capital value of many holdings—particularly those of tenant farmers, many of whom had been looking to their stock to provide them with a decent pension in retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned inspection charges and the many costs of tagging, cattle passports and abattoir waste disposal that have been imposed on farmers. Many of those costs are not imposed on our continental competitors. it is in the Government's power to mitigate the effects of them, but they refuse to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are things that the Government can do. I have mentioned currency compensation, and they can mitigate the costs of new regulations, restore the cuts that were made in OTMS payments and guarantee certainty in the hill livestock compensatory allowance. Without action, today's crisis may become an even deeper one tomorrow. Farm incomes are under pressure, so how will young people be encouraged to come into farming? Its age profile is already high. In addition, where will the money for basic repair and maintenance, let alone new investment, come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have failed to get to grips with the crisis facing Scottish agriculture. We shall return to the issue again and again, not least at the rally on Friday, which I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to attend. We shall not give up until the Government face up to their responsibility to ensure that the crisis in Scottish agriculture is brought to an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>11.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Mr. Maxton, that the procedure of calling a Minister from the other place to make a statement to the Committee and then subjecting him to questions is a highly satisfactory innovation? It is a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were limited earlier to one question, so may I ask a few more of which I have given the Department notice? I have already referred to the two-hour meeting of West Lothian farmers, and the first question relates to the acceptability of a traceability scheme to our European partners. Will something be said about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question is raised in a letter from Stuart Wardlaw of Haughhead farm, who says:
	<br><q><p>"I would also like to point out the situation regarding cull cows. Two years ago cull cows were worth approximately £700. Today they are worth £295."</p></q>
Does that correspond with the Government's understanding of the prices? What can be done about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question is about the extra tagging of cattle. One of my correspondents writes
	<br><q><p>"Ten pounds per animal for cattle passports is not acceptable. Why not £3.50 or £4.75"?</p></q>
Is £10 regarded as too much?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth question concerns slaughter costs, which I am told are
	<br><q><p>"£50 per animal at slaughter to cover extra Meat Hygiene Service inspections and abattoir waste disposal costs."</p></q>
The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"These extra costs cannot be recovered through higher selling prices, so incomes fall to an unsustainable level. The main problem in the beef sector is that we are being punished for a mistake we did not make."</p></q>
My visits to abattoirs have impressed me, but I am a layman. What is the Government's view of abattoir hygiene?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth question stems from remarks of Willie Russell of Wester Woodside farm. He writes:
	<br><q><p>"Additional costs are being placed on our industry due to the BSE problem and new abattoir regulations due to the E. coli outbreak. These are amounting to approximately £50 per beef animal and these charges look like increasing substantially in the coming months."</p></q>
I am ashamed to say that the outbreak of E. coli 0157 started in Western Lothian at Redhouse farm in Blackburn. I couple this issue with a question that I have previously raised about the relationship between E. coli and raw sludge. I do not know whether the Scottish Office has anything to add to the statement on this matter made on the Floor of the House by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Russell writes:
	<br><q><p>"Imports form both EC and non-EC countries do not meet our hygiene regulations and because meat and bone meal is still used in these countries their rendering costs are very much less than ours."</p></q>
If the Government accept that that is true, what can be done about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend the Under-Secretary wrote a letter to me on 15 January, about William Forrest and Son, a matter brought to my attention by the National Farmers Union. He wrote:
	<br><q><p>"The Government concluded therefore that there was no sustainable case for diverting scarce resources from elsewhere to continue to shield the disposal chain from the additional costs which it now faces, and that the support payments should be phased out by the year end as planned."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
He continued:
	<br><q><p>"It will also be of interest to you to know that with effect from 1 Janaury our domestic controls on the removal of specified material from cattle, sheep and goats have been extended to imports as well. I anticipate that the resultant compliance costs will be met by the suppliers."</p></q>
What is the Government's estimate of those compliance costs? I understand that they can be substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I asked the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about issues raised by an article in 	<i>New Scientist</i> called "Fallow Ground", with the subheading
	<br><q><p>"Farmers need better incentives to foster plants and wildlife".</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food replied:
	<br><q><p>"The results of our monitoring"—</p></q>
of the arable stewardship pilot scheme—
	<br><q><p>"will be available in 2001. If these show that the new measures have a beneficial effect, Arable Stewardship could direct us towards a model for the future and the kind of measures that might operate countrywide in a more environmentally sympathetic countryside, following a reformed CAP."</p></q>
What arable stewardship scheme exists in Scotland? Are the Government pursuing the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) took part in a meeting with farmers in his constituency. Before Christmas, I invited farmers to attend a meeting in my constituency. As a result of just one press release in the well read local paper, the Dundee 	<i>Courier and Advertiser,</i> 300 farmers attended the meeting. Their anger was apparent. We would not usually associate demonstrating at ports with the Scottish farming community. Those activities emphasise the unprecedented nature of the crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Protesters' anger is not focused only on the United Kingdom Government. The Government are often blamed for difficulties that they inherited from their predecessors. Anger is also directed at supermarkets, which continue to sell imported beef instead of quality Scottish beef. They sell imported beef that has not been subject to the strict hygiene standards that are widespread in our abattoirs. Some of that beef is imported from countries with BSE records that may be worse than that of this country, and which do not implement the controls on slaughtering and disposal of spinal cords and brain tissues that exist in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that imported beef is monitored to ensure that it fulfils the UK's high standards. However, I fear from the parliamentary answers that I have received that such claims are simply a public relations exercise to disarm farmers. The monitoring is a sham and fails to provide proper guarantees to farmers that imported beef is safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish farmers have a right to a level playing field. The Government must translate rhetoric into action. There should be no beef that does not meet UK hygiene and safety standards on our supermarket shelves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the history of the crisis. The bungling and delay of the previous Government and their incompetent mince wars raised the hackles of our European partners, and created barriers to lifting the ban on Scottish beef, thus preventing it from returning to world export markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
I shall not concentrate on past mistakes, which include the delay in developing a computerised traceability scheme, and the rejection of a zonal approach to lifting the ban. We have subsequently arrived at that approach through the Northern Ireland decision on the certified herd scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have to stress to the Minister the importance of ensuring that a working computerised traceability system is in place in Scotland as soon as possible. I listened with interest to the Minister's comments on the date-based scheme and the importance of making progress on that. I hope that the Government's efforts are successful. It is astonishing that we have waited so long for a computerised system in view of the technology at our disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to substantiate his noble Friend's comments about progress on lifting the beef ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members who represent agricultural constituencies will be aware of three other matters that I want to raise. I want to consider the sliding sale price of beef, the OTMS changes, and the additional cost burdens on the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Christmas I visited the United Auctions market at Perth with my hon. Friend the Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) who cannot be here. As a result of the visit, David Leggat, the managing director of United auctions, gave us some information which may be of interested to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first week of the year, the recorded average sale price for store cattle fell to 94p per kilo, compared with an average price of 116p last year. In the same period, the prices for prime steers plummeted from £746 a head to £636 per head. Prime heifers raise an average price of only £500 at auction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The narrow margins for beef farmers are being squeezed tighter by the price spiral. The additional cost burdens on the industry, the continued closure of export markets and the competition from low-quality cheap imports, which have led to a backlog of beef in the supermarkets, are all contributing to the price slide. Each problem requires Government attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have done the beef industry no favours as a result of the reduction in compensation under the OTMS and the introduction of new weight limits. Last summer's restriction on the number of OTMS abattoirs under the new tendering system, which caused a delay in slaughters and prevented many of my constituents from claiming under the old rates, resulted in a further loss of income for farmers across the country. That was a quite unnecessary loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) talked about farmers' assets in relation to compensation for OTMS business. What concerns me most about that is that the value of cattle is very much part of the pension calculations of individual farmers. In one stroke, prices fell from £700 to £300 and the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) had other statistics. That shows how much the asset value of farmers has been undermined in this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may reply that they have already spent billions on BSE-related compensation packages, but they must remember that the roots of the BSE crisis lie with the previous Government. This Government should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
continue to shoulder their share of the burden to assist farmers through these difficult times. That responsibility should extend to the additional costs now being borne by the beef sector. There should be strict regulation of food production, but farmers in my constituency cannot understand why Scottish and UK farmers are being asked to bear the costs of this regulation while so many of their EU competitors are not. That is not fair competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain why so many EU nations do not require their farmers to pay meat hygiene inspection charges, which are an EU-wide requirement, while our farmers face £40 million of charges from the Meat Hygiene Service. Our farmers are having to pay increased costs for abattoir waste disposal and we are about to see a £10 per head cost for cattle passports, which cover the full costs of the cattle movement service. The industry today is in no state to absorb the double whammy of lower incomes and increased costs. The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland referred to the TSB agricultural study and its depressing news that 94 per cent. of respondents believed themselves to be less prosperous this year than last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have concentrated so far on the problems of the beef sector but the crisis also extends across every other sector of the industry. That is what is different and unprecedented about the conditions faced today. No sector is able to counterbalance the weakening conditions that have been experienced in the beef sector. The key element is the strength of the pound, with sterling up 20 per cent. against some currencies and 20 per cent. up against the ecu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cheaper imports are leading to lower prices in the UK, with the arable and dairy sectors being equally affected. The latest figures I have been given suggest 20 per cent. falls in the price of milk and a 30 per cent. fall in staple crops such as barley, prices for potatoes, soft fruits and cereals—all of which are important in my constituency—are down across the board. I hope that the Government will accept that this cross-sectoral fall is unprecedented, highly damaging and requires more action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned some of the prices from United Auctions Mart in Perth. Lamb prices have fallen by around 35 per cent. in the course of 1997, the average price per kg on 15 December 1997 being a mere 82p compared with 129p a year earlier. That is just over £30 a head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prices are collapsing at the market but I have no queue of constituents telling me of their relief at the collapse of prices at the supermarkets. That puts into perspective the notion that somehow a benefit will be passed on to farmers at some later stage. As prices fall the cost of new machinery and equipment rises apace. The TSB September economic bulletin showed that while the index for product prices has slumped by 20 per cent. since 1996, there has been a slow but steady growth in the cost of investment goods. It is a little wonder, therefore, that the TSB agricultural survey for 1998 shows that anticipated investments in machinery, implements, tractors and livestock, falling by more than 50 per cent. on 1997 levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that the impact of the financial crisis on the farming industry extends beyond the farmyard gate: secondary employment and investment will be hit, businesses throughout the rural economy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
threatened, and the depopulation of rural areas accelerated. That package will be a disaster for rural Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The root of the crisis, at least in terms of price undermining, is the appreciation of the green pound. A strong pound means less real value for EU support payments, lower minimum prices and increased imports. As we know from the evidence of the TSB and others, while incomes fall, costs are still rising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have defended the £85 million assistance. Whatever assistance is available is obviously welcome. It would be churlish not to say that. The Minister will say that no bottomless pit of resources is available, yet £2 billion is being spent to mark the millennium—£500 million of it for a bubble on the Thames. No wonder that the public worry about the Government's priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate should be focused as much on routes out of the crisis as on its cause and extent. First, the Minister should re-examine compensation payments to diverse sectors of the industry and consider whether there is room for a more extensive package of assistance. He may point out that our Treasury will have to bear a larger share of the compensation burden than our EU partners as a result of the Fontainebleau agreement. However, it also provides that the UK receives a multi-billion pound rebate. Cannot some of that rebate be used to protect the farming industry in the face of such a combination of factors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am unsure of the Minister's relationship with the Chancellor, but if he is not listening already, someone ought to tell the Chancellor about the damage caused by his interest rate policy to every sector of Scottish industry, of which the farming sector is only one victim. The current level of interest rates is unsuitable for the current cycle of the Scottish economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Government should move from rhetoric to action on the monitoring and control of the quality of beef imports. If my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan) is fortunate enough to catch the Chairman's eye, he may have more to say on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I ask the Minister to re-examine the additional costs faced by the industry for cattle passports and in inspection charges in order to establish whether transitional arrangements can be introduced to protect the beef industry during this vulnerable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, every effort must be made to ensure that the date-based scheme is accepted by our European partners to enable the earliest possible return of Scottish beef to world export markets. At home, the Government must face up to the folly of the unnecessary ban on beef on the bone, which has undermined confidence. That ban should be lifted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and in the longer term, there must be a complete re-assessment of the scope and nature of agricultural support mechanisms and a strategy for the reinvigoration of our rural economy. While recognising the need for reform of the common agricultural policy throughout Europe, I fear that the Government's zeal for cutting public expenditure will result in the UK agricultural sector being hit much more and much earlier than those of our European partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of headage and acreage payments has failed. Too much support has been focused on the welfare end of the market. The payments system does nothing to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
encourage diversification and only helps maintain overproduction in the industry. Assistance should be targeted on quality and those who face the greatest challenges in their farming activities: in other words, on sustainability and economic diversification. In line with developments in world trade negotiations, we should not be paying what amounts to a subsidy for production but should be investing in the farm, the area and the economy as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Scottish Parliament will be at the forefront of negotiations on the future of the common agricultural policy. Any amendments to the Scotland Bill should try to enhance the powers and responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament in relation to European business. That is fundamental to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farming industry, alongside fishing and forestry, should be seen as a key element in the development of the rural economy. It should be developed as part of the wider renewal of rural Scotland, not decommissioned only to be replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord Sewel referred to the White Paper on a development strategy for rural Scotland, which is an interesting document. I shall quote from the Secretary of State's introduction to it:
	<br><q><p>"We have been elected with a manifesto commitment to sustain vibrant local communities in rural and remote areas. We recognise that those who live in rural areas have special needs. We also recognise that the countryside is a great natural asset and part of our heritage which calls for careful stewardship. We need to balance this with the needs of the people who live and work there."</p></q>
I positively endorse those views, but I fear that the Government's policy on agriculture will not be consistent with the Secretary of State's warm words in that document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much that the Government could do to give renewed impetus to our rural economy. Possible initiatives include land reform, cuts in rural fuel duties, infrastructure investments, restructuring of business rates and tackling the issues of compensation. Such an agenda does not always require enormous resources, but simply the imagination and courage to carry through reform. The long-term challenge is to ensure that Scottish agriculture never again experiences the sort of crisis that it is facing today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I use the word "rigorous", because Members of the other place normally get the opportunity to ask only one question at a time.

I note the fact that the inquiry into BSE begins its deliberations today. It is part of the confidence-building process that the Government are having to develop. Resolving the problem will take time, and the fact that negotiating in Brussels is not particularly easy is often ignored. Those who want full Scottish participation in the negotiations in Brussels when the Scottish Parliament is in place may find out then that being able to participate in the discussions is not necessarily the answer to all the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
I recognise the problems that agriculture faces. In recent weeks, I have had meetings with the Clackmannanshire and Kinross branches of the National Farmers Union. To say that they were full, frank discussions may not go far enough. The word "robust" is the most polite that I can use. However, I did not sense from those members of the NFU any disillusionment with the Labour Government. Very few of them voted Labour. They did not vote Labour because they did not expect much from us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How farmers vote does not deny them the right to complain, but it puts into context what we have always thought about farmers—they complain about everything. They complain about good weather and good harvests, which take too much out of the ground. However, when they have a genuine complaint, as they do this year, the public do not take them seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the constituencies of hon. Members like me, who represent areas with industrial interests and high levels of urban poverty, are not particularly sympathetic to the plight of farmers. However, I listened to some of my constituents with agricultural interests on Friday. One of them, whose main activities are sheep and arable farming, told me about the price of barley. Last September, he expected to receive £100 per tonne, but he received £76. He expected the value of barley to rise by £1.50 per tonne per month, but, instead of getting £82, which would have been the result of such a monthly increase, he gets only £67 for barley for storage. That is a serious problem. The price of lambs is expected to be 20 per cent. down. To put it slightly differently, a farmer with a turnover of £120,000 a year, is likely to experience a drop of about 16 per cent. in his income this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A dairy farmer gave me the following figures: he is currently receiving 5p per litre less than he was last year, when the price was 25p per litre. On 54,000 litres a month his income has fallen by £2,700 a month. On a herd of 200 cows—each cow will fetch £300 less than last year—there will be a fall of £6,000. He expects that the sale of 50 bull calves will be cut by £50 per calf, a drop in income of £2,500. It is little wonder that on a turnover of £300,000 he expects a drop in income of about £40,000 in the current year. The other farmers that I met, who were officials of the Kinross NFU, told the same story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not confined to farms; it affects small businesses, which may employ just the family and one other person. It could be argued that only a few people are directly involved, but one must take into account that when farmers are making money the option is not to go to Majorca, the Caribbean or somewhere like that; the nature and structure of the farm and its employment arrangements are such that they cannot afford for many folk to go away. The farms therefore tend to spend their profits on improvements, which means that other people in the agricultural community are employed. Whether the farms spend all their money on new equipment, or whether they allow equipment to last that bit longer, a continual delay in expenditure, and the putting off of repairs and maintenance that have to be done by specialist contractors, have an impact on a farm's efficiency and on the local economy because people are not being employed to carry out that work.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
Problems arise further down the chain. It was drawn to my attention that Kingdom Cheese, of Cowdenbeath, usually takes between 60,000 to 80,000 litres of milk from the 30 dairy farms in Clackmannanshire and Kinross to make Mozzarella cheese.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Fife?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of things in Fife of which my hon. Friend is clearly unaware. I was not previously aware that Cowdenbeath was the centre of Mozzarella cheese making. A gourmet such as my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) will be missing a chance if he does not go to Cowdenbeath. The cheese being produced there now is made from imported German raw cheese, which denies sales opportunities to the farmers in the 30 farms in Clackmannanshire and Kinross who contributed about 60,000 to 80,000 litres of milk a year to cheese making in Cowdenbeath. The impact on jobs is already beginning to be felt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farmers also flagged up concerns about the indigenous poultry industry. Regardless of whether one considers that the conditions in which chickens are kept is undesirable, the fact is that a company such as Marshalls employs about five men a shed in rearing poultry. Those employees are at risk from the import of cheaper chickens from abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to their concerns about imports and the knock-on effects, farmers expressed anxiety about the detail of the Food Standards Agency, although not about the principle. They were clear in expressing their feelings that it was important that the link should be severed between the Department and those responsible for food standards. However, they felt that a disproportionate amount of what is likely to be the cost of financing the Food Standards Agency will have to be met by the primary producers. There is a consensus that that should be reconsidered, because it seems that an undue burden is being placed on people who believe that they are responsible stewards of their farms. They have no confidence that importers will be as careful, or that the monitoring processes will be as rigorous, as they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), said that Customs and Excise officers would be responsible for the monitoring process. They might be doing a first-class job, but the Committee needs more information about them. I realise that the Minister was under pressure to answer questions this morning, but will he tell the Committee about the qualifications of the officers and about the rigour with which they approach their work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion went on for almost two hours, like the one in which my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow took part. It had been preceded, just before Christmas, by another two-hour discussion with my constituents in Clackmannanshire. They told me that their problems were far more serious than the ones that they had previously complained about publicly. They felt that that was a partial justification for their new-found militancy. They wanted to know if they militancy was winning them any friends. I had to tell them that I did not think that it was. I pointed out that some of the payments that were coming
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
from Europe had been delayed because the Government did not want to set a precedent of responding to riots at ports as a means of negotiating money for the agricultural sector. I am not sure whether those who support such demonstrations would have done so if they had taken place in the mid-1980s, like those by the miners in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parallel with the mining industry is not out of place, if we consider that in recent years there has been a massive contraction in that industry. Employment has been reduced, with devastating social consequences on remote communities that are in the middle of many of the farming areas in central Scotland that we are discussing today. Labour Members recognise that there is a case for the agriculture industry, and that there is also a strategic case on health grounds that we should not be dependent on imports. If there is a case for some imports in our food chain, it should be set out and its social and economic consequences should be addressed. I hope that the Government will consider that problem; we do not want agriculture to drift through poverty and disadvantage and for its contribution to the economy to decline out of al recognition. We need to find the correct balance. The Conservatives behaved as though there was no problem; if the European Union was subsidising the fat cats in the farming industry and Conservative Governments gave them financial and moral support, everything was all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strength of sterling will not necessarily be a long-term problem. With the right policies, the pound will come down. By 2002, I hope that it will be able to become part of the European monetary system. In the transitional period, however, we must pay careful attention to the problems in specific industries. The arguments advanced by farmers are no different from those advanced by textile manufacturers in my constituency, nor those made by chemical firms that operate in the European market. The whisky industry in my constituency employs far more people that agriculture and its plight is just as great. However, if we are to see a reduction in our currency and an improvement in the system, that must be on a phased basis with the specific needs of particular groups taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my initial point. The plight of farmers is like that of the little boy who cried wolf. In 1998, however, the wolf is at the gates of the farm and it must be more seriously addressed than it has been in the past. Many of us have been cynical—rightly—about the false crying of the farmers, but those cries are no longer false. They require the degree of concern that the Government are bringing to the issue. Improvement will take time and we must explain to the farming community that it will not happen overnight, or even necessarily in the first year of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame my noble Friend the Minister for not going to the rally on Friday. He would have got nothing out of it. The farmers want instant solutions, and there are none. Those who offer sweet words and instant solutions are not telling the truth. They should be exposed as such. No short-term answer exists to a problem that requires patient negotiation and funds from a Treasury that it finding it difficult to give to far more vulnerable sections of the community the support that some of us think they deserve, although we understand why there is that degree of parsimony.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
Farmers are in a difficult position and deserve a degree of support. However, let us not forget that they have had a lot of support in the past. In the good years, perhaps, they did not make the provision that they should; perhaps they were never strong enough or well advised enough to do so and now circumstances have changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that we shall return to this issue, because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will not be able to satisfy everyone today. However, on the basis of the past nine months, the Government are making progress. That is a credit to the country and will do the job for the farming industry in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.17 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ochil (Mr. O'Neil) recognised that the wolf is at the door, whatever others may glibly have said earlier about the crisis or the attitudes taken and statements made. That is important. He also said that there are no short-term solutions. Recognition of that makes it vital that whatever the Government do now, they must ensure that an industry exists when the solutions finally arrive. The real concern is, especially in areas such as north-east Scotland that were so effective in producing and exporting quality beef, that if the industry does not survive until the end of the ban, yet another export industry will have gone from the armoury of the United Kingdom's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a point made forcefully by my party about a tendency within the islands of the UK towards unilateral reform of the common agricultural policy. By turning down schemes that other countries have used to support their farmers, we have undermined our own industry while supporting its foreign competitors. That is a slightly bad deal for the British taxpayer: we keep other industries going and fail to subsidise our own. Reform of the CAP has to happen on a uniform basis throughout Europe. Otherwise, whoever goes first will lose out in the open market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only concern. I come from an area where many companies are trying to get into exporting oil and oil-related services. The high value of the pound is a problem for all of industry and anyone who exports. Anyone interested mainly in importing is rejoicing, but the problems of currency stability and the high-value pound are real.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is disappointment that the new Government have not fully grasped the chance for once to by fully part of a European system at its foundation. By ruling out a single currency until after the next election, they have ruled us out of influencing the foundation and building blocks of a new scheme that will affect our economy whether or not we join it. Both the Labour party's and the Conservative party's policies, with their finite time limits before they will make a decision, seem somewhat arbitrary, whereas they should say "We should join a single currency if it is in the interest of this country and we should not if it is not". That would send a far better signal to the market. It would possibly help to stabilise the pound and keep the pound down, if the markets were clear where this country was going in relation to the rest of the European currency. That would help not just farmers but the other industries that have been talked about. If the Minister could take that suggestion back to the Treasury, that would be most helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lord Sewel's statement he said that spouses were not counted in the figures for those working in the industry. To judge from the farms that I have visited so
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
far in the constituency, spouses of whichever sex play a crucial role in running and working on the farm. We must remember that when we look at a farm's income, we must divide it by all those working on the farm in order to see how well or how badly it is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord also said in his statement that farmers forget that there is no such thing as free money. In terms of their own environment, the hours they work and the time that they put in, they recognise that there is no free money for them. Because of the labour and time that they have to commit to their farms and the number of days that that involves, the chances of taking a holiday away from the farm and even of taking Christmas off are limited: cattle need to be fed and looked after every day. Therefore, we must recognise that a great deal of unseen work and sacrifice goes on among the small hill farmers. It is easy to single out some of the grain barons in East Anglia for opprobrium, but the farmers we meet in our constituencies are not such grain barons—not least because we have Scottish constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many points have already been raised and, in the interests of time, I shall not go over them again, but the Minister could take some specific points away and consider them, if he cannot respond now. Recent reports suggest that the source of the E. coli crisis may well be Argentinian beef production, given the high meat consumption there and the potential for that to have triggered the cycle of E. coli between humans and beef. When the Government look at the conditions that have to be met by beef imports, will they take into account not just BSE but other health considerations, because our farmers face severe hurdles and expenses in meeting the new health standards relating to E. coli? Again, it would be unfair for them to be subject to competition from markets which do not meet those standards and therefore put our consumers at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in terms of a level playing-field, it seems perverse that someone serving this country in military service is being denied the chance to eat British beef. The Ministry of Defence may not be able to buy British beef alone, but I should have thought that it would be perfectly acceptable for it to make sure that British beef is on the menu wherever the Ministry of Defence is providing beef to British service men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other concern, a perennial one in any industry when regulations come in, is whether the regulations are necessary. A specific concern raised with me on one farm visit was the fact that OTMS cattle have to be prepared to the same health standards as cattle sent for human consumption. Yet they are going through a different slaughtering line. That means extra work and extra time for the farmer, time that he cannot put into more productive economic activity. Similarly, all the work involved in getting the cattle ready for market increases the risk of injury to the farmer. Could the Minister find out whether it is necessary for farmers to go through all that labour and burden for cattle that are going for disposal and not for human consumption?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as emerged in the Minister's statement and the questions, there is a perennial concern about whether the United Kingdom ministerial set-up understands how to operate in the European Union and get the best deal for the United Kingdom. The long history of political leadership in the previous Government meant that we would not get a good deal. I am worried, however, when Ministers make statements in December about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
compensation packages and then find in January that there may be problems in the European Union, because it suggests that they are not sure what the problems are and that they may have to rejig their packages. Policy would be so much more effective if we could grasp how the European Union works, introduce packages that fit the relevant criteria and if we were confident that the Ministry understood that. If the Ministry does not understand how the European Union works, there is clear concern as to how quickly the date-based scheme will be implemented. One of the farmers' great fears is about the signals being sent out. There is a worry that the certified herd scheme will allow the Ministry to drag its heels on accepting a date-based scheme. Similarly, the ban on beef on the bone seems to say to the market, "Don't take our beef; we're not confident about it yet." A finite time limit before which the regulations must be positively renewed should therefore be built into the regulations on beef on the bone. That would give the industry confidence that the regulations will not be left on the statute book long after they are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have confidence in the born-after scheme, we should be confident that the cattle that come under it are safe to eat and to export. That signal must be sent to the rest of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will assure farmers that the Government have a grasp of how the European Union works, and that they will look positively at how to obtain the best deal for farmers from the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles, on his first appearance before the Grand Committee as a Minister. He has a great interest and a lot of expertise in this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1 May, I have attended a number of NFU branch meetings in my constituency, and have held a number of constituency surgeries in which ordinary farmers have spoken to me about the crisis in the beef industry. Earlier, the subject of rallies came up, and I have also addressed a rally in my constituency at which more than 350 farmers were present. I was therefore left in no doubt about the strength of their feelings abut the crisis in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, which is the largest Labour-held constituency in the United Kingdom, farming, especially tenant farming—it is important to differentiate—is a vital issue. Farmers say to me that their rents are going up and their incomes are going down. That is a difficult financial equation to square. It is a truism to say that farming is much more than just another industry; it is a way of life. That is not just true of the highlands, but of all rural Scotland. If we lose farms and farmers, we will find that rural schools will start to close and that there will be less income for rural shops and rural post offices. Some rural communities will be lost altogether, which we must avoid at all costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of the crisis has been amply demonstrated. Beef and sheep income has decreased. Income from lamb has decreased by about 40 per cent., and that from barley has decreased by about 30 per cent. For me—and I hope for the Government—the primary objective is to ensure that we lift the beef export ban, and satisfying the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
Florence agreement is absolutely vital in achieving that. My understanding is that the selective cull in Scotland is almost complete. We have already heard about the date-based scheme, and the certified herd scheme—a computerisation system for which is to be introduced—which are, of course, vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way forward must be to consider the differentiation of Scottish beef. Any management theorist will tell hon. Members that there are two alternatives to be considered in differentiating a product—quality and price. It is not possible to have both. In the case of Scottish beef, we must strive for a high-quality product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the use of jargon, but we must establish chain assurance. We must ensure that high quality extends from the farmer to the slaughterhouse, from the slaughterhouse to the supermarket, and from the supermarket to the consumer. That is why I welcome the Government's initiative of hygiene assessment scores. I understand from MAFF advisers that this scoring system is to be introduced in the next week. The scoring system which is currently unique in Europe, will apply to individual slaughterhouses. The system will allow a consumer to go to his or her local supermarket and to see, on perusing that supermarket's shelves of beef, whether the beef on sale has been killed in a five-star slaughterhouse or a one-star slaughterhouse. That will not be possible with imported beef, as it is not currently subject to an assessment scheme. We must emphasise the quality of Scottish beef, which will increase confidence among consumers and in the farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is psychologically important for our European Union allies to have confidence in our industry, as they will be making the decision as regards lifting the ban. I also welcome the recent announcement of the establishment of the Food Standards Agency, which will be of great importance in ensuring quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that time is against me, but I would like to raise a few more issues. First, I would like to refer to the armed forces, which were mentioned by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who is not in her place, has also been actively involved in that matter. Wherever possible, it is important for the armed forces to buy British beef. I recently wrote to the armed forces about that matter, and I got a reply from Rear-Admiral Trewby, who is the chief executive for the naval bases and supply agency. I was surprised by some of his comments. He said that the price of the product was important, which I am sure that all Committee members accept, and that he did not feel that the United Kingdom industry was capable of supplying beef to the armed forces in the quantity that they needed. Judging by my correspondence with Mr. Stuart Whiteford, who is the acting president of the National Farmers Union, there is some debate about that. I welcome the fact that MAFF and the armed forces are meeting for detailed discussions about that matter. It is obviously important to secure a vital, large market for our product in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to decommissioning—which is the term that the European Union used, although some prefer the phrase "retirement scheme", which is used in the fishing industry—many farmers have written to me saying that they want to leave the industry. It is important to utilise the current European scheme. We must encourage young farmers to go into the industry. I know about the argument that that should not be done because of over-capacity, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have shared concerns about retirement.

What measures does the hon. Gentleman support to ensure that some of that value is restored?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people are concerned about capital values. To what extent are we willing to intervene to stop changes in capital value? The hon. Gentleman may discuss that matter in relation to future programmes.

I must flag up for the Committee the importance of allowing new entrants to joint the industry. This industry is vital for the highlands and rural areas and for the sustainability of rural areas; we are not discussing simply another industry. We must satisfy the Florence agreement as quickly as possible and ensure that the beef ban is lifted.

Scottish beef is a first-class product. We must continue to differentiate and to bang the drum for that industry, which should ease the malaise that affects it and give it a future with consumers and farmers in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Earlier this morning I asked Lord Sewel whether he could give more detail about the extra checks that were performed at ports to enforce the new hygiene regulations for imported beef, which had applied since 1 January. Although I received no firm details, I was firmly told that the checks were the responsibility of Customs and Excise officers. My hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) asked the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food earlier this month if he would list the occasions since 1 January on which Customs and Excise personnel had inspected loads of imported beef to ensure compliance with standards. He was told:
	<br><q><p>"Checks to ensure that imported beef meets the necessary health requirements are not the responsibility of Customs and Excise officers. Checks are carried out by the Department or authorised local authority officers at Border Inspection Posts".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 January 1998; Vol. 304, c. 	<i>495.</i>]</p></q>
The Scottish Office believes that Customs and Excise is carrying out the inspections; the Minister of State believes that officials from his Department and local authority officers carry them out, and the farmers believe that the inspections are hardly being carried out at all. Will the Minister clarify the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two kinds of inspection are being carried out, as I understand it. One is on specified risk materials being imported, and Customs and Excise is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
doing that. Inspection of OTMS cattle is carried out by local authorities, because that is not a ban on imports but on sale for consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that. However, my substantive point remains. We need more information on precisely how many inspections are being carried out. There is a grave suspicion that little is being done and that the whole thing is a cosmetic exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to turn quickly to the problem affecting the knackering industry. The industry deals with fallen cattle and cattle that die from disease. It collects cattle from farms at no charge and disposes of them. It used, before the BSE ban, to sell by-products such as meat and bone meal, tallow, dogmeat and so on. That is how that industry made its money and was able to afford to collect cattle for nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the BSE ban, the market for the by-products and hides has totally disappeared. The knackering industry has no income but still has the costs of collecting dead cattle from farms—something like 300 dead cattle a month in Dumfries and Galloway. If the industry has to impose a charge to make business viable, farmers have an alternative. They can quite legally bury fallen cattle on their land, but there are two problems with that. First, what public image will be generated if the public find out that 300 cattle are being buried in the fields of Dumfries and Galloway and similar numbers elsewhere in the country, even if there is no health risk involved? Secondly, given the high rainfall and shallow depth of soil over rock in my area, much material may find its way into waterways and aquifers, accidentally polluting them. How will that be policed when the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency is already overstretched?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the time. Like the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan), I shall be brief and shall not go over what has been said already. I want to draw one or two things to hon. Member's attention, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like others, I have met farmers. On the first occasion, they appeared on my doorstep on a Sunday morning, much to my despair. I made the point then that the manner in which farmers had blockaded ports a few days before was not a way in which I would conduct my business. That was, in fact, the first time that any farmer had approached me, so they had had other ways of doing business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers believe that there is great public support for them. I must say, in echo of other hon. Members, that they have been crying wolf for many years. They seem to moan even in the good times. On this occasion, then, I do not think we can really say, in truth, that times are bad for farmers. People do not want to believe it. The public support that farmers believe in simply is not there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unilateral action that farmers took at the ferry ports was wrong. I want to highlight something that happened in my constituency. On 22 December, a local meat packing business went into receivership. The receiver set about the business of securing a new owner and seven offers were made. The new owners were a consortium of meat packing businesses, and they promptly shut the business down. I met two of those people on Friday last when they made it abundantly clear that they believe there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
is overcapacity in the meat packing business. They have taken the unilateral decision to close down other businesses that end up in receivership. They lead me to believe that there are a number of such businesses. Such unilateral action does agriculture no good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope that those employed in the farming will get it into their heads that they are well subsidised and well supported. If this had happened to any other industry in this country, many sectors of that industry would have gone to the wall before now. There is a lesson to be learned. We need positive ideas such as those that are coming from the Government and from those in agriculture to consider the future direction of the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to wind up this short debate. It has been a good debate; I echo my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland in thanking the Secretary of State for allowing it to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still disappointed by the statement that was made by the noble Lord Sewel, which could have been made by a Conservative Minister. Indeed, if it had not been read so well, it could have been made by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton in his day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are being unduly and worryingly complacent. However, I shall do my best to meet some of the points and the question that was raised by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I agree, as I think everyone in the Committee would, that there are long-term problems that need to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will not find us backward in coming forward in trying to work positively and constructively to achieve that end. The programme might take five to ten years to achieve. The important point that the Minister should take from the debate is that so long as that is done equally throughout Europe, the farming industry will be willing to engage constructively and robustly in the discussions and consultations that will ensue and to which we will contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not have any sense of the Government's feeling the anguish that I hear about in my constituency from farmers who cannot see their way through the next six months. Some tenant farmers in my constituency now have six-figure overdrafts, with a bank manager on their shoulder saying that those overdrafts must be reduced within a 12-month period at £20,000 a quarter. That is impossible for them to contemplate. Moreover, the capital value of their stock, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine rightly said, constituted the accumulation of their pension. Their whole future is therefore uncertain. I have analysed profit-and-loss estimates for some businesses in my constituency that detail £19,000 and £20,000 losses in the next financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an immediate short-term problem, which needs an immediate short-term response. It is a one-off situation. Agri-money—the green pound package—is supposed to deal with such a situation, when businesses are faced with a short-term shock in exchange rate fluctuations, which can be addressed by some smoothing of the curve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the Fontainebleau agreement, since the mid to late 1980 we have had the advantage of our contribution to the European Community being about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
£2 billion lower. That was negotiated by Mrs. Thatcher, for reasons with which we are all familiar. The money has been saved; it would otherwise have been expended. Other European member states have been expending at the full rate, so they do not have the extra marginal costs that we now face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of that money should now be cashed in, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland proposed. [Interruption.] It is money that has been forgone, but it is not an insignificant sum, and is part of the equation as far as agri-money is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other European countries—such as Ireland—use 100 per cent. of the available package. That means that Irish farmers in the beef sector receive £100 per head. That is not available to our beef sector, but it is available to the Irish. In cereals, it is £14 per hectare; in milk it is 0.62p per litre. That is the level of disadvantage with which our industry is currently, in the short term, being asked to deal. It is not sustainable. It cannot go on, year in, year out. Of course there are a lot of compensation payments, of course some of the sums look big, but they are necessary to keep competition fair. The industry argues that it is a question of fairness and principle. It is an emergency that is happening now and it must be addressed now, because, if it is not, producers will not survive to engage in robust negotiations with Lord Sewel about what happens in the year 2000 and beyond. It is irrelevant to them, because they simply will not survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State says, "What are you asking for?" That is a tough question for an Opposition party to answer, and I am not even a spokesman; I am a simple expert on social security, which may stand me in good stead when my farmers come looking for income support. If we are not paying it through European subsidies, we will be paying it through a social security system in the rural areas. I shall give my best guess—the Minister for School Standards is not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are spending £300 million on welfare to work over the next two years—a one-off payment to support and create jobs. I do not think that that £300 million will create as many jobs as we will lose in rural Scotland over the next two or three years if we do not have access to agri-money support. It will take a sum of around £300 million to address some of the discrepancies between the market conditions that we face and the market conditions faced in places such as Ireland. Therefore, this is a question of fairness and of doing something quickly before the industry is decimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quickly underscore a couple of other points, which I want the Minister to look at as well. The hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale mentioned two important matters. The scrutiny of the importation of beef and the questioning of the standards must be tangibly carried out. The Under-Secretary gave us a reply that we understand—the technical answer on his bit of paper—but nothing is happening out there. Has a single pound of imported beef been seized at the ports? Will he find out? Will he ask his officials to find out what beef has been impounded? Where are the carcases? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Has there been an inspection? These are important practical questions about the system that has been put in place. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] They are not academic questions. Is the system in operation and is it working?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knackers' yards worry me as well. I think that some of the stock of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) are knackered by the St. Botolph's knackery. My regional fallen stock disposal and collection procedure will go out of business in the next six weeks because the knackery is now considering charging farmers as much as £60 a beast to collect fallen stock. I know what will happen. Farmers will go back into the dead-pit scenario that the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale rightly warned against. If dead pits start coming into south-east or south-west Scotland, with private water courses, with an attempt to get farm-assured systems established, with a new problem of establishing traceability in some of these animals—how can we trace animals if they are to be tipped by JCBs into big holes in the ground?—how can we have confidence when we go to Europe to argue that we have a bomb-proof system? The people at the dirty end of the rendering trade do a valuable service and I pay tribute to them. It is not work that I would do myself. They do not make a lot of money at it, but they are an essential part of the process, which will disappear in the next few weeks unless some fairness is ensured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister talk to the supermarket chains about the role that they are playing? We are all arguing the case that farmgate prices have collapsed, and they have. They have not in Sainsbury and they have not in Safeway. I can see that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), does no shopping of any kind, because he registers a blank look when I put that point to him. Last time I was in a supermarket, there was certainly no evidence of it. Over the past three weeks, lamb prices have fallen lop while lamb in supermarkets in the borders remains at the same price. What is going on? Where is the money going? There is profiteering involved in some of this and the Government would do themselves a great favour and establish confidence in the industry if they began to be more robust in asking penetrating questions of the supermarkets that have a stranglehold on the market for high-quality goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: no, it goes much wider than that. This is about sustaining sensible levels of employment in rural areas where there are no other employment opportunities. It is not like Govan; we can create enterprise areas until we are blue in the face, but there is nothing that we can do if there is no viable farming industry. What is at stake in the short term is the essential underpinning of the fabric of the economic and social life of rural Scotland. If the Government and Secretary of State do not understand that, and do not do something within the next six months, they will be responsible for the kind of decimation that we have not seen in Scotland since the clearances. Something must be done, and done immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
We have had a valuable debate on what is obviously an important industry and one that faces a difficult time. Helpful points have been made and some other points have been made with vigour and strength. The Government are listening to all points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me begin with a general picture of crisis facing the industry, as did the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland. It is true that difficult situations face farmers, but we must consider the whole picture. There are particular reasons for the current financial crisis. Obviously, BSE has had a large part to play, but the public, the taxpayer and the Government have paid a lot of money—£2.5 billion since the crisis began—to help farmers through that. That is the scale of support that has gone to the farming industry. It is inevitable that an impact will fall on the farming industry and we should not disguise that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other general problems are affecting the economy, notably the high pound, which affects fanning and other sectors of industry. It affects not only urban sectors; we must remember industries such as fish fanning and fishing. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire talked of a £300 million package to help fanning: would he extend that help to the fishing or fish farming industries, or to others? We have to consider the difficulties facing all industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have responded to the crisis and to the pressures on the farming industry. Subsidies for the farming industry have been at record levels at £500 million for last year in Scotland. That is outside the special package targeted at beef farmers because of their particular situation: £85 million was allocated, and a third of it will go to farmers in Scotland. It is not fair to accuse the Government of complacency or of not treating the problem with the urgency that it requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks confidently about the assistance that the Government are giving to the industry. It is one thing to appear before a Scottish Grand Committee making such statements. If he has such confidence, and given that Lord Sewel is unavailable to meet the NFU on Friday, perhaps the Minister would care to turn up and put the Government's view to the farmers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appear before crofters and farmers every weekend when I go back to my constituency, so I am well used to that. My noble Friend has also attended those council meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge what the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland and other hon. Members have said about falling incomes facing farmers. Again, that must be considered in the round. It is not fair to emphasise one year's falling incomes without appreciating that over the past two or three years the fanning industry has seen higher than normal incomes, largely because of various compensation payments following the MacSharry reforms, which were intended to compensate for falling prices which never materialised. Therefore, an extra £0.5 billion has gone into the farming industry over the past three or four years. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred to the Fontainebleau agreement and said that we should treat the money that we have gained over past years as an insurance policy and spend it this year. The same point could be made about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
windfall that has accrued to the farming industry over the past two or three years—an extra £0.5 billion. The steep fall in farming incomes, which I acknowledge has occurred over the past year, must be seen against that background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members, particularly the hon. Members for North Tayside and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, touched on the need for fundamental reform, and they are right. We can only move and stabilise the industry in the longer term through a policy of fundamental reform of the CAP and the whole structure of farming. He is also right to say that reform must tie payments more and more to social, development and environmental objectives and not just to production. I confirm that reform of the CAP is a high priority for the Government during its presidency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept the concern in the farming industry and in the widespread rural community that the Government plan unilateral reform of the CAP and are not pursuing a collaborative reform of the CAP, which would lead to stable conditions for the Scottish farming industry in comparison to other parts of the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire also referred to the worry that we would be forging ahead of other European
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
countries. That is not the intention. Reform must be done across the European Union. We cannot unilaterally reform and adjust our farming structure without the whole of the CAP being reformed at the same time. That is why the Government have strongly resisted a simple blanket imposition of modulation within the CAP as part of Agenda 2000, because we know that that would have a disproportionate effect on English and Scottish farmers. Therefore, we are fully aware of the need to ensure that reform is common and fair and is seen to be fair throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I rattle through the points that were made, I shall not cover all of them, but I shall try to deal with as many as I can before I am told to sit down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I gave details of how the monitoring is being done. I acknowledge the widespread concern in the Committee about how it works in practice and whether it is effective. That will have been heard by my noble Friend and I am sure that he will pay particular attention to it.

My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and the hon. Member for North Tayside asked what progress was being made on the traceability scheme and the date-based scheme, and on attempts to have the ban lifted.

With reference to the traceability and datebased schemes, and attempts to have the ban lifted, my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and the hon.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Transport (Aberdeen)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</p>
	<p>1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Savidge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the previous debate, I have the unqualified support of my local National Farmers Union for the proposal that I shall put before the Committee. That is a hint that although the Order Paper refers to transport in the Aberdeen area, the issue is important for the whole of north-east Scotland. The traffic congestion and transport problems of Aberdeen city are crucial ones for our region, particularly as it is regarded as peripheral and on the outskirts of Britain and Europe. The main solution to that state of affairs must be integrated public transport including park-and-ride schemes, and rail transport solutions, such as a heavy goods rail head outside the city and better commuter links—some of the suggestions made by the Scottish Association for Public Transport in its report yesterday. I should favour co-ordination of those by a body similar to the Strathclyde passenger transport executive. I part company with the Scottish Association for Public Transport, however, over its claims that its suggestions form an alternative to a western peripheral route around the city. On the contrary, such a route is central to the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the trunk road, the A90, goes through the city of Aberdeen by crossing the centre of a residential built-up area, creating all the problems of pollution, severing of a community and danger of accidents. Any attempt—which would have to be a restricted attempt—to widen or improve the road would necessarily increase those problems. Without such an attempt, the road is slow, costly and unpredictable. As a result, traffic increasingly rat-runs down more unsuitable routes and pushes into the city centre, which is over-congested. At the southern end of the road is a bottleneck that could be cured only by destroying the highest-grade ancient monument in the city, the historic Brig O'Dee—or perhaps I should say bridge of Dee for the sake of 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is the western peripheral route. We call it that rather than a bypass because only 15 per cent. of traffic bypasses the city, although that is significant because much of it is heavy goods traffic. Careful traffic studies have shown that a high proportion of journeys that either begin or end in the city and currently go through the city centre could be diverted to a western peripheral route. The western peripheral route could include grade separated junctions—flyovers and slip roads, both features that speed the flow of traffic considerably and reduce the danger of accidents, by making junctions safer and removing traffic from residential areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme could, by reducing congestion, contribute considerably to the quality of life, and be environmentally friendly. It could help by reducing journey time, moving traffic out of the city centre and cutting car commuting. It could help locally to reduce the health hazard of urban air pollution, and of course globally in contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The western peripheral road could also make a contribution by making public transport services accessible. It would promote easy accessibility to rail services, and, perhaps most important, to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
park-and-ride scheme, making a few parking sites easily accessible. That would create a virtuous circle by reducing the number of routes, increasing the frequency of services and the number of passengers, and reducing the fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a scheme is successful it will free up the city centre for greater pedestrianisation and for cycle tracks. I do not claim that there is no environmental down side. Because the road was not built earlier it cannot be built nearer to the city centre, so to avoid housing it has to go through the green belt. But the green belt areas concerned do not include any sites of special scientific interest; they are mostly areas of agriculture and cultivated land that is not open to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A careful environmental impact assessment has shown that damage to the environment can be minimised; we shall do the best we can to improve the scenic views of the road and from the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be a definite and positive advantage if we can increase the accessibility of potential sites for business, industry and science parks in the city area. That may reduce the pressure to seek such sites in the green belt. Sustained economic development is crucial to the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accessibility can be vital to a company's decision on location. That is most important in an area such as mine which, as I said, suffers from being viewed as peripheral in Europe and in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last November, Grampian Enterprise published a research report showing the vast importance that the scheme could have to economic development in the area. It also carried out a survey of businesses in the area and in other transport centres. The three harbours—Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Aberdeen—said in their different ways that the scheme could make an important contribution. Aberdeen airport was even more dramatic. It said that it had found that businesses just south of the River Dee were diverting 70 miles to the small airport of Dundee rather than trying to cope with the hazards of traffic in Aberdeen, with all its environmental and economic implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ten other business organisations were surveyed, including chambers of commerce, enterprise trusts and the major oil industry organisations such as the Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors Association and the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association. They were unanimous in saying that the western peripheral route was important for the economic future of Aberdeen. One of the organisations representing businesses surveyed its members and found that 94 per cent. supported the western peripheral route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public representatives of the area, across party lines—the city council, the Aberdeenshire council, and hon. Members throughout north-east Scotland—support the project. I pay tribute to a local paper, the Aberdeen 	<i>Evening Express.</i> It did not run a campaign in favour of the route but it publicised the issue and carefully presented balanced arguments on each side over several months. It carried out an opinion poll, the result of which showed 89 per cent. support for the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is in line with the five criteria that the Government have laid down: it improves integration, accessibility, safety, the environment and sustainable economic development. I will be asking the Government, in the run-up to the White Paper on integrated transport and roads, to consider the scheme sympathetically.

Gentleman leaves the matter of public support, I am sure that he will want to reiterate that given the circumstances in which other urban road plans in Scotland have engendered such fierce opposition, the fact that this scheme enjoys such substantial public and cross-party support in the north-east of Scotland is a significant aspect in its favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point. I am sure that the Minister will listen to what he said with interest and I hope that it will have a significant influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to funding, this is possibly a case for considering a partnership between the private and the public sector and obviously local government need to play a part in it. Dare I ask for national Government funding? It is a long-term scheme, and the western peripheral route would make a significant contribution to the trunk roads network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People from my area have sometimes felt that both London-based and central belt-based civil servants have neglected them. Yet we in the north-east of Scotland can surely claim to have made a vital contribution to the economy not only of Scotland but of Britain. It is therefore not unreasonable to ask for re-investment in our area to ensure that we continue to make such a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, a western peripheral route combined with an integrated public transport system can contribute to greater road safety and, by reducing congestion, it can contribute to a better quality of life. It can be environmentally friendly by helping locally to reduce pollution and globally to reduce greenhouse gases. Locally it can help to produce more jobs for the north-east of Scotland. Nationally, it can help to ensure that an area that has played a key role in this country's economy will continue to do so. I therefore contend that the western peripheral route is north-east Scotland's road to the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) on securing this opportunity to debate transport and on the manner in which he made his case. I thank him for the courtesies that he extended to me in intimating some of the concerns that would be raised in the debate. I intend to respond to the points that have been raised and speak a little about the Government's general approach to transport. That will allow me to cover many of my hon. Friend's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport is high on our priority list and, on taking office, we moved quickly to fulfil two of our manifesto commitments by launching the preparation of an integrated transport strategy and by announcing a strategic review of the trunk roads programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the integrated strategy and the roads review is well known. Car ownership and, importantly, car usage have grown relentlessly. While the old "predict and provide" approach would tell us that we should be matching this growth with new road capacity, there is a growing realisation that this approach simply does not work. While the increasing pressure on the road network may predominantly come from the sheer increase in car
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
ownership, new road capacity generates more usage and therefore adds to traffic demand. Which, if unrestrained, will have adverse environmental and economic effects, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North has already alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, satisfying all the projected demand is an unaffordable aspiration, even if it could solve the problem at no environmental cost. Opportunities exist to develop alternative measures, such as increasing the role of rail freight and public transport. These have been seized upon elsewhere, but have been neglected here as the previous Government focused narrowly on deregulation and privatisation. Further evidence of the challenge facing us came last year with new national traffic forecasts suggesting that, on the basis of past policies, overall traffic is set to grow by 38 per cent. over the next 20 years and by 52 per cent. on the trunk road network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The integrated transport strategy will be presented in a Scottish White Paper to be published in the Spring, in parallel with the United Kingdom White Paper. The intention is to set out proposals for an effective, integrated and environmentally sustainable transport policy. The Scottish White Paper will be tailored to Scotland's needs and will reflect its distinct geography, population settlement pattern and location within the United Kingdom and Europe. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan because, in a sense, roads create controversy. In the north-east it is important to take into account not only the aspirations of the area but the views of local people about the future for transport modes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key aim will be to assess the contributions that different transport modes can make to an integrated policy. Within that, we shall examine mechanisms to reduce reliance on road transport and to facilitate easy interchange between modes. Improving accessibility to transport for all people in Scotland will also be a key theme of the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the concept of integration means more than simply integrating different travel modes. We must go further and ensure that transport policy in future is integrated with other policy areas, such as economic development, sustainability and land use planning. On the last of these, for example, our review is considering how best to co-ordinate issues of transport and accessibility with land use planning in order to avoid creating unnecessary demand for travel while, at the same time, providing necessary transport infrastructure to support worthwhile development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of this strategy lie environmental considerations. The future of Scotland is dependent on the its economy. We must ensure that what we are doing not only satisfies important environmental considerations but also contributes to a healthy, vibrant economy. That matter was alluded to by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategic trunk roads review, also stems from a manifesto commitment and reflects the need for a fundamental re-examination of the rationale for road construction within an integrated transport strategy. The review is taking account of the Government's criteria if economy, safety, environmental impact, accessibility and integration and is developing a revised investment appraisal framework to reflect these criteria. My hon. Friend raised those points in his knowledgable contribution. As part of this work, we shall be reviewing pressure points across the entire trunk road network. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
addition, the review is also considering sustainable transport alternatives to new road proposals, measures to restrict or reduce traffic growth and the scope for improve value for money for expenditure on maintenance, structural repairs and minor schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We plan to consult on the emerging findings in the spring and to conclude the review by the summer. The results will then inform the decisions we will be taking on priorities for trunk road investment. Also relevant to these decisions will be the level of resources which we can make available for road building. We inherited a declining roads budget from our predecessors and, for next year, we have transferred resources from roads to other higher priorities including support for life-line air and ferry services to the northern and western isles. Affordability and value for money will, therefore, be key considerations in determining a future trunk road programme and while decisions are some way off, it would be imprudent to assume higher investment in new motorways and trunk roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many of the issues that we are addressing at national level are being taken forward in the Aberdeen area. I am aware, for example, that Aberdeen city council is currently preparing a transportation strategy that aims to address transport problems in the city in a balanced way and I commend the council on this forward—looking initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is that spirit that we want to capture in the White Paper and I am pleased to congratulate Aberdeen on moving on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the council's intention to carry out a public consultation exercise as part of its strategy development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Office officials are liaising with those in Aberdeen city council on a number of matters of mutual interest. I note, for example, that the draft strategy refers to a future study of
	<br><q><p>"the potential for a road pricing system in Aberdeen"</p></q>
The merits of traffic management demand measures are being given thorough consideration within the on-going investigations into the integrated transport White Paper and the roads review. Until this work is completed, it would be premature to comment on whether we will go forward with permissive legislation on road pricing, which would be the context in which Aberdeen and other local authorities and other city councils would be able to proceed. My hon. Friend should be aware that the matter is being discussed at UK level as well as in Scotland and there will be further discussion before the White Paper is published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Population projections published last week by the Registrar General for Scotland suggested that Aberdeenshire's population might be expected to rise by 8 per cent. over the next 15 years while Aberdeen city's numbers are set to fall 3 per cent. over the same period. Again, my right hon. Friend commented in print last week on the implications of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these projections are realised, demand for travel to Aberdeen may increase. Meeting this demand must be achieved in a sustainable way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that in his review he will look carefully at meeting that demand by trying to facilitate the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
reopening of stations such as Laurencekirk station. The development of the commuter rail network in the north-east seems to be much in keeping with the philosophy that he was outlining earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to say that that is what we want to look at in terms of our overall transport policy. Apart from the issue of specific modes of travel, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North made another telling point. The Strathclyde area has a model for integrating public transport. We are considering the Forth transport infrastructure partnership study, which covers the Forth estuary. The highlands and islands are looking at a more integrated basis, and there is no reason why the north-east should not, too. We are conscious that we are not just looking at roads and access, but at a cross section of facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North made an important point about through traffic to Aberdeen. Although it is only 15 per cent. of the total, much of it consists of large lorries. One of the largest gas terminals in Europe is at St. Fergus, and Fraserburgh and Peterhead are major fishing ports. As there is not an inch of railway line in my constituency, the through traffic cannot take an alternative route. Therefore, what the Minister said about railways may not be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A road-pricing strategy would impose a heavy penalty on traffic that has no alternative but to use the road. It would not be in line with the thinking that suggests that new roads encourage traffic. The issue is about allowing major traffic to get through to Aberdeen, as it has a right to do, without facing the problem of congestion or the penalty of road pricing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate those points. I referred to access to railways, but freight presents a different problem. We are seeking to improve access to Aberdeen, but, as the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan pointed out, freight gives rise to other considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Road pricing will be considered in the White Paper, but it is a matter for partnership between local councils and the Government. We must develop a strategy that is sympathetic and empathetic to the needs of different parts of Scotland. We shall bear the points made in mind. They send a powerful message to Aberdeen city council and Aberdeenshire council that those issues must be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that the city council's challenge fund bid for a park-and-ride project at Kingswell, with bus priority measures along the A944 corridor, was successful. Major works on the project are set to begin later this year and will add to the already established park-and-ride facility operating along the King street-Ellon road corridor. The service attracts the 300 vehicles a day and carries nearly 4,000 passengers a week. I congratulate the council on the success of the scheme. I am sure that park-and-ride schemes are likely to become increasingly important in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office has been working with Aberdeen city council, Aberdeenshire council and transport operators on a study of how best to implement a more integrated transport policy for the Aberdeen travel-to-work area. I am sure that the study, which has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
examined transport corridors into the city in the context of future demand, will prove extremely useful to those concerned with transport in the Aberdeen area. It will also serve as a model for the development of local strategies elsewhere in Scotland. There is a premium to be gained from not just looking at a national strategy for Scotland, but from ensuring that it is consistent with local aspirations and local needs, and especially those for the economy. I expect the report on that study to be published shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to note that the partnership approach, involving Aberdeen city council and Aberdeenshire council and central Government, has been adopted in the study. That is the way forward. The creation of a Scottish Parliament will be another boost in ensuring that the aspirations in the highlands and islands and the north-east are fully taken on board and are properly and thoroughly discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, we all stand to benefit from sharing resources and expertise and from the development of common transport goals. I wish to see an open, non-adversarial joint working approach extended. Proposals on how co-operation on transport matters between authorities might be encouraged are likely to be an important element of the White Paper proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about the co-operation that is required to deal with congestion and to consider road pricing. Clearly, we also need structures. My hon. Friend has referred to the fact that Strathclyde provides one model, but there are others. I hope that the White Paper will enable us to consider them further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trunk roads remain an essential facet of any transport system. The A90 in Aberdeen became part of the trunk road network only in April 1996. Since then, improvements, safety measures and maintenance work amounting to more than £1 million have been implemented on the city stretch alone. We are also currently considering a report on current and predicted traffic flows, junction performance and measures that would ease flow and increase roads' carrying capacity. The report also examines the needs of pedestrians and cyclists on the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other trunk road serving Aberdeen is the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness. Since 1988, more than £40 million has been spent on improvements to the route and they comprise 26 road schemes and 36 local safety improvements. Work is also underway on a bypass of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
Blackburn and Kintore. That will complete the upgrading of the Aberdeen to Inverurie section of the A96 to dual carriageway standard. The bypass is expected to be completed by the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further work on the A96 and A90, including the £20 million dualling scheme between Balmedie and Tipperty—I hope that I pronounced that correctly because I always experience some trauma when I come to new names of villages and towns—will be dependent on the review's findings. The scheme was dropped by the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen city's wish for the construction of a £75 million Aberdeen western peripheral route. This is not currently a trunk route and, as I said earlier, the Government are not in the business of predicting and providing new road space before alternative public transport measures have been examined. However, in some cases, new roads may provide the most appropriate solution to transport needs. I can, therefore, assure my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North that, should the A90 through Aberdeen emerge as a priority network problem the western peripheral route will be considered as one of a range of possible solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that in the context of my hon. Friend's comments, because appropriateness is vital to the Scottish office. That point was reinforced by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan. Too often, roads are developed amid enormous controversy. However, sometimes a consensus exists on the need for a road. We have received correspondence from the chief executives of the business developments in the area that reinforces the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware that the important decisions on transport policy that we will take over the next few months will have an important bearing on economic, social and environmental conditions throughout the country. My hon. Friend has usefully drawn attention to a number of concerns in the Aberdeen area. We are still at a formative stage in policy development, and I can assure my hon. Friend that his points will be taken carefully into consideration as we complete our policy deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powerful message is that transport is high on our agenda. Needs and aspirations throughout Scotland have to be considered. The Government, through dialogue with local authorities and hon. Members, want to find the best, most appropriate and cost effective solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
