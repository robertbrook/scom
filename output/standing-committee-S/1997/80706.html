	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning everyone. The Secretary of State would like to raise a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. Today is the 10th anniversary of the Piper Alpha tragedy and I think that the Committee would wish me to say one or two words about it. That devastating event was the worst ever catastrophe in the North sea oil industry. There has been progress since then: Lord Cullen's recommendations have been implemented by the industry and the Government have introduced new health and safety legislation. However, today's anniversary and the recent loss of life in Dundee remind us that danger is ever present, and of the debt that we continue to owe our offshore work force as it secures vital energy resources for the United Kingdom. We must always remember the sacrifice of those who died and the trauma and sadness that live on for the survivors and the relatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order and the Secretary of State's tribute, Mrs. Michie. For all of us, the moment when we learned of the terrifying scale of the Piper Alpha disaster is for ever imprinted on our memories. However, our memories cannot be compared with those of people who remember the loss of a loved one, or a work colleague, or who still bear the physical and mental scars of that tragic night. Even after 10 years, words are
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
inadequate to convey comfort and condolence to those who still mourn and suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State said, we owe a tremendous debt to those who win resources from the North sea. Indeed, we were reminded of that again at the weekend with the death, in Dundee, of two people on an oil construction platform. For many years, our country—and my constituency—has benefited from the oil that was piped to the Flotta terminal from the Piper Alpha field. Possibly the greatest tribute that Members of Parliament could pay to those who died is to ensure that lessons are identified and learnt; that there is no complacent backsliding; and that the safety regime, which is required by law, matches the risks and dangers that are encountered by those who work offshore. We must ensure not only that laws are made, but that they are regularly monitored and enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. I wish to associate the Scottish National party with what has been said about Piper Alpha. It is entirely appropriate for us to remember that anniversary and to express our condolences, because we are responsible for the legislation that protects those who work offshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the positive response given by the Leader of the House to a question last Thursday that called for a parliamentary debate about the progress of the offshore safety regime, in the light of the Cullen recommendations. That debate should also examine the further legislative changes that could be made, especially in the corporate sector, to offer additional protection to those who risk their lives in the dangerous environment of the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although those were not strictly points of order, I believe that everyone felt that the Committee should commemorate this important anniversary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now move on to oral questions. I remind the Committee that this item of business will end in three quarters of an hour from now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State was asked</i>—</p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Scottish Homes (Glasgow)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Shettleston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with Scottish Homes regarding the future maintenance, repairs and landlord for the Scottish Homes properties in Hutchesontown, Glasgow; and if he will make a statement.[47532]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Decisions on future maintenance and repairs are for Scottish Homes to consider, but I have been kept closely informed of the situation regarding its houses in Hutchesontown. I am especially grateful for the important and constructive role played by my hon. Friend in liaising between the tenants and the different parties involved in that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his reply. As he is aware, there are almost 1,000 homes in Hutchesontown, of which only about half have been modernised, despite the fact that 10 years ago all the tenants were told that their homes would be modernised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree that it is wholly unacceptable to condemn about 500 families to a wait of several more years before their homes are improved? That wait is due to the failure of any possible new landlord to secure funding for the transfer of those homes after Scottish Homes disposed of them. Will my hon. Friend ensure that that matter is resolved as soon as possible, even to the extent of considering the funding of these essential renovations by Scottish Homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give my hon. Friend an undertaking on that matter. As he knows, one of the difficulties was that the number of multi-storey blocks in the area made it difficult for us to make progress on the original proposals. Scottish Homes is examining all options for assisting the area and I will keep my hon. Friend fully informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Government are investing 35 per cent. less in housing in their first two years than the Tories, and that public sector housebuilding has almost ground to a halt in Scotland, it is no wonder that the problems of Hutchesontown can be seen throughout the country. Why have the Government abandoned local authorities and the public sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Gentleman acquired his figures. The Government have increased funding by £65 million since the election—that is over and above the amount that we inherited. In previous years, there were substantial cuts in housing. We are considering the matter and will make an announcement after the comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EU Funds (Reform)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has had on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
proposed reform of EU regional and structural funds; and if he will make a statement.[47533]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ministerial colleagues and I have received representations on EU regional and structural funds from the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) and seven leaders or councillors. I will ensure that their concerns inform the long and complex negotiations on Structural Fund reform that lie ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State acknowledge that following the successful visit to south-east Scotland by the Minister of State last week, it is absolutely necessary for the local economy to be underpinned by European structural funds after the current 5b programme runs out? I am sure that the Minister will have briefed the Secretary of State about the fragile state of the economy in the borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made the helpful commitment that the borders would be given a reallocation from any unused EC structural funds. Such funds must be deployed either by the end of next year, or, at the latest, early in the next century. When will the Government be able to tell us what reallocation might be available to the borders economy, so that people can plan under these difficult circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point. The Minister of State visited the borders, especially Hawick, because the Government appreciated the situation there. I have had many representations on the matter from people in the borders. I accept that structural funds are of genuine importance. At present, the borders is covered by objective 5b, which is comparatively modest, but has been of some help. Since 1994, about £23 million has come from that allocation. We have made it clear that unused funds can be redirected to the borders and that will be done. We are considering that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State confident that the change in criteria will ensure that Scotland will still receive structural funds? There have been substantial changes in the boundaries that apply in England and Wales—for example, Wales has been split into west and east Wales rather than north and south Wales. Can he reassure the Committee that the changes will not be to the detriment of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we are at an early stage of the negotiations. At present, 85 per cent. of the population of Scotland is covered by one of the strands of the structural funds. It is well known that the Commission intends to reduce that coverage, not specifically in Scotland but throughout the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear that we want a fair system, so we shall argue strongly the case both for existing areas and for a proper place for Scotland in the restructured structural patterns when the seven bands are reduced to three. I do not want to take a hard and fast line, other than to give a total undertaking that we will use our best endeavours to get the fairest possible deal, whether for the borders, the highlands and islands or for older

industrial areas that suffer from the stress of the rundown of their economic structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Independent Commission on Local Government</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will request the independent Commission on Local Government to consider in particular the impact of the structure of local government in the highlands on its democratic accountability. [47534]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament will take account of the particular needs and perspectives of different parts of Scotland, including the highlands, in conducting its work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that the last restructuring of local government in the highlands, which scrapped historic units and put together a vast local authority for the whole highlands area, was done without the benefit of independent advice and at the time was described by his colleagues as gerrymandering? Is he aware that, notwithstanding the efforts of councillors on the Highlands council, it is too large an area to be properly represented by a single unit of local government; that its interests are different in different parts; and that the single conurbation of Inverness, which is prosperous, cannot properly represent the sparsely populated peripheral area? Is he also aware that for as long as this council has existed, strategic errors have been made—such as advocating a single case for objective 1 funding for the entire highlands area, notwithstanding the very different circumstances of most of the area from Inverness, which, by its success, has effectively ruled out the prospect of objective 1 funding for the north?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember right hon. Gentleman's views from the time of the previous reorganisation. I do not think that anyone is under any illusion that it was perfect. It was a controversial reorganisation which was heavily criticised at the time. However, it would not be appropriate to think about reordering these boundaries and putting local government through the trauma and upheaval that it would cause. The next review is due in 2004 and will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. In view of the Minister's unsatisfactory reply, I seek leave to raise the issue on the Adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman. Members of the Committee will no doubt have noted his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>New City Status (Scotland)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on the mechanism for the creation of a new city status in Scotland.[47535]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: City status is awarded by Her Majesty the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Queen, acting under the royal prerogative on the advice of the government of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 100 years since a new city—Dundee—was created in Scotland, yet, after recent competitions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the towns of Sunderland, St. David's and Armagh were created cities. Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is strong support for the creating of a city from the people of up-and-coming towns such as Inverness? Would not that be an ideal way to mark the new millennium?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend probably had something in mind, so I am not totally surprised. He is correct when he says that Dundee was created a city in 1889, which is a long time ago. I know of no plans to recommend a new Scottish city connected with the millennium. However, I hear what my hon. Friend says. Many factors, including public status and the size of any aspirant, must be taken account of as part of the consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Lockerbie</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will request the Lord Advocate to appear before the Scottish Grand Committee to answer questions on Lockerbie in relation to information held by the Crown Office.[47536]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It would be quite improper for my noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate to give details of the evidence held by the Crown Office in relation to the Lockerbie case at a time when criminal proceedings are pending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were the Lord Advocate with us, would he accept that in a matter of justice in Scotland, the Foreign Office would overrule the Crown Office? Does not yesterday's claim by a Foreign Office spokesman indicate what many of us have long thought—that it has far less to do with justice than with the British-American relationship?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refute totally that suggestion and the premises upon which it was built. We have to deal with this matter as a serious, sensitive issue that involves the world community. We have international obligations. We want to bring the two Libyan perpetrators of the Lockerbie bombing to justice, and to stand trial. The quickest way to achieve that is for Libya to hand over the two suspects so that they may have a fair trial, either under United States jurisdiction or in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that this matter should be treated seriously: it should not be turned into political football in the new Scottish Parliament. We have to ensure that we do not flaunt international obligations, which are the preserve of Westminster in the devolution settlement. We must be careful that the SNP does not use the issue to allow tension to build between Holyrood and Edinburgh at every opportunity. The Labour Government want to go forward in Scotland; the SNP will use every opportunity to wreck the new relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also be careful about the Lord Advocate's role as independent prosecutor. The way forward now is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to build unity around the issue at the United Nations. For the future, we must ensure that the Holyrood Parliament and Westminster, covering both foreign affairs and the courts issue, make progress and settle the matter. That is the only constructive way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister of State's reference to the independent role of the Lord Advocate as a prosecutor in the public interest, as laid down in the Scotland Bill. Will the Minister confirm that in a devolved or non-devolved Scotland, that independence must not be compromised by the Foreign Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with the hon. and learned Gentleman. It is right that the Lord Advocate remains our chief top prosecutor in Scotland. Nothing should undermine his ability to deal with criminal proceedings—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] As usual, SNP Members snipe from a sedentary position. We need to ensure that the devolution settlement works. That requires the Holyrood Parliament to work seriously and sensibly with the Westminster Parliament in matters of foreign affairs.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that Lockerbie is in my constituency—I remind members of the Committee that later this year we shall reach the 10th anniversary of this tragic incident—does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the helpful comments of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect a note of anxiety in the Minister's voice as he answers questions about the Lockerbie case. Does he accept that either the Lord Advocate is an independent prosecutor, or he is not, and that either criminal justice and procedure is a devolved matter, or it is not? The Lord Advocate is independent, and criminal justice and procedure is devolved.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is talking about the Foreign Office having a veto. I have no anxiety, but I express my revulsion of a political party that wants to take a serious, sensitive issue and turn it into a political football in the new Parliament. That is what the SNP is inviting the Committee to do. Constructive comments have reinforced the view that the Holyrood Parliament can work only if it sees Westminster as an ally in

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Al within Scotland, traffic congestion currently occurs at Dolphingstone junction on the eastbound off-slip road during the evening peak, and on Sundays at the B 1437 East Fortune junction east of Haddington.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend take it from me that congestion on the single carriageway Al south of Haddington is intolerable? There have been an alarming number of head-on collisions on that section of highway, which is supposed to link Scotland with the north of England. It must be said that the moratorium on major road improvements makes life more difficult, but I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the fact that a short piece of extra dualling is going ahead at Dunbar later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a public inquiry into plans for dualling the A 1 between Haddington and Dunbar in February 1997, almost 18 months ago, before the Government came to power. Is my hon. Friend yet in a position to make an announcement on the outcome of that inquiry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important year for transport in general. The comprehensive spending review is under way, the White Paper is soon to be published, and, of course there is the trunk roads review. I have kept my hon. Friend in touch with developments on all those plans and we shall co-operate closely.

Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) affects travel, traffic and transport to and from Edinburgh. One of the casualties of the late local government reorganisation was the ability of a region to consider transport collectively. Will the Minister help, and lead, the local authorities in the area to produce a better combined plan for people and goods to get to and from Edinburgh, by improving the roads, where necessary, the railways and other public transport? Will the Minister take what could be a useful co-ordinating, leading role?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Sam Galbraith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are currently eight major projects under way in Scotland for either new hospitals or substantial redevelopment on existing sites. In addition, there are a further 16 smaller new build or refurbishment projects under way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his answer, which is welcome. The 50th anniversary of the national health service was this weekend, and my hon. Friend is aware that my constituents in Wishaw have been waiting for 35 years for the new acute services hospital, which was announced last month. Can he say approximately when building will start?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great affection for Law hospital, where I was at one time the neurosurgeon. I am delighted that the new hospital is going ahead. It will be a major project, the first substantial piece of new investment for the area. It will be a state-of-the-art hospital, which will mean considerable savings and thus allow us to reinvest in the care of patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will accept that all projects in the health service are ultimately dependent on the hard work and commitment of the staff. In that context, is the hon. Gentleman giving any weight to the recent report which showed a high level of depression in the nursing profession? Many nurses have said that they would leave if they could find another job. What pressure is the Scottish Office placing on the Government to try to restore nurses' morale?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will restore nurses' morale is the health service that we are building. It is the most modern health service in Europe, centred on the patient and with the highest level of technology. The nurses, like all those working in the service, do a job beyond the call of duty. I salute them and all the health workers on the 50th anniversary of the NHS. I reassure them that we are building for them a health service in which they will not just want to work, but be proud to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister will recall that when he visited Ninewells

hospital last Monday he was questioned closely on a project that is dear to the heart of all those involved in health care in Tayside—the provision of a fourth cardiovascular unit for Scotland, to be based at Ninewells. Can my hon. Friend tell us whether he is any closer to taking such a decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must increase the number of people who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting from about 350 to 600 per 100,000. We are considering how best to do so. We are looking at the present unit and considering whether to open another. Once the decision has been taken, I assure my hon. Friend that he will be informed as early as anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is willing to take responsibility for hospitals that open under this Government, will he also accept responsibility for hospitals that close?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We should not be afraid of hospitals being closed—sometimes they have outlived their usefulness. At one time there were large tuberculosis hospitals, but I hope that no one is suggesting that they should have been kept open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of care is to take people out of hospital and put them into the community. Every political party subscribes to that policy. I do not want any whingeing or second-guessing about local hospitals. We should remember that the issue is not bricks and mortar or the protection of the producers' interests, but what is best for the patient. When every political party realises that, we shall make considerable progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary have met the National Farmers Union as recently as 26 June, they will be aware that declining farm incomes continue to cause great concern, as, indeed, does the income of those in ancillary farming industries, such as the suppliers of machinery, contractors and engineers. Work done by the NFU shows that those incomes are declining, which bodes ill for rural communities.

the Government share. As he knows, we have announced special aid for beef and sheep farmers of £80 million. We have also announced a scheme to help farmers with the cost of new regulations and some £17 million will be available for that purpose. We are trying to restore confidence in the farming sector. Negotiations are continuing with the authorities in Brussels about lifting the ban, but our intention is to ensure that the ban is lifted for the whole of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) an update on progress towards lifting the beef ban. Can the Minister be more specific about the measures taken to secure the date-based scheme, which is the Government's principal proposal for Scotland? Does he believe that the application of the beef on the bone ban may be used by our European partners to illustrate the Government's lack of confidence in the beef sector, and that it may further impede the expeditious lifting of the ban that all hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary; we had to reassure the authorities in Brussels that all necessary measures were being taken to restore public confidence in British beef. With that in mind, it was right to ban beef on the bone. That shows that we are prepared to take difficult decisions. I cannot further update the hon. Gentleman on the negotiations, except to say that they are continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend in welcoming the progress made towards the lifting of the export ban. Will he join me in congratulating local authorities throughout Scotland, which have now put Scottish beef back on the menu for schools? Only two authorities have yet to do so. Perhaps he can encourage them to make it a clean sweep, which will ensure that all local authorities in Scotland are providing school children with safe, high quality Scottish beef.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's views. We are right to promote the high quality of Scottish beef.

The particularly high quality of Scottish beef will ensure that it has a strong future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister acknowledge that the continuing ban on beef on the bone is causing a great deal of grief to Scottish farmers? Rather than dragging my constituents through the process of the courts, will the Government now acknowledge that the risk associated with beef on the bone is much lower than that which the Health and Safety Executive regards as tolerable, and that the ban should therefore be lifted as soon as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should acknowledge that beef on the bone accounts for a very small fraction of the wider beef market. The impact of

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend last met the Scottish Council for Development and Industry at its international forum on 19 March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that Mr. Jonathon Muirhead, the managing director of the Bridge of Weir Leather Company and the recipient of this year's Scottish Council gold award for exports, has spoken strongly about the damage that the level of sterling is doing to his industry, and which is being duplicated across the Scottish economy? What representations have the Scottish Office and the Minister made to the Treasury about the level of sterling? Perhaps one of the new Labour lobbyists could arrange a meeting with the Chancellor. Does the Minister believe that the level of sterling is too high, too low or just about right for the health of Scottish exporters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had a direct representation from Mr. Jonathon Muirhead, although I would be interested to receive one. Many export companies in the borders, to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) paid generous tribute, are doing very well. Clearly, other companies have a combination of problems, one of which may be the strength of sterling. However, we must retain a longterm view of the matter, about which we are in constant discussion with the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Political parties that criticise the way in which the level of sterling is currently set are obliged to say how they would set it. Should it be done by central political diktat? Given that the SNP has had 60 years to think about the matter, it will no doubt want to share its views with us during the debate that follows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend notice last week's OECD report, which praised the Government for their wide-ranging structural reform agenda to increase living standards, especially among the less well off? Is it not true that delivering macro-economic stability and fighting poverty and social exclusion are two sides of the same coin? Is not a credible long-term strategy better than the incoherent, opportunistic carping of the SNP and the Tories?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. When political opportunists try to paint a picture of constant doom and gloom, they do an extreme disservice to Scottish industry. Despite the strengthening of the currency, Scottish manufacturing output rose by 7 per cent. last year. That is not a bad

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many independent people would recognise the Minister's efforts on behalf of Scottish business. Does not he accept that the level of sterling is not totally beyond the Government's control? Early entry into economic and monetary union or even signalling a willingness to bring it about, would have a valuable effect on sterling. It would benefit not only exports but our hard-pressed tourist industry and farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's party—and every party represented in the Committee—is committed to a referendum on that issue at the appropriate time. The response that I have received from Scottish industry is that the Government are right not to rush into joining the single currency but to put the question to the United Kingdom people at the appropriate time. That is the sensible way to proceed. It would not be in Scottish industry's interests—due to all the factors that were rightly referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm)—to be panicked into a different approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had 18 years of ideological hostility to the European Union and currency reform. The idea that a Government can leap straight from that situation into membership of a new monetary system is wrong. We are approaching the matter in exactly the right way and I hope that the answer will be the right one for the United Kingdom and Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Minister of extra funding—to the tune of £3,000 per job—to create jobs in deprived areas. I have since discovered that the route to acquiring such funding is for potential employers of local labour to discuss their needs with the Glasgow development agency. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that this benefit should be publicised more widely than it has been. We are constantly confronted with bad news but good news such as this—which will help deprived areas—has scarcely had any attention.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I hope that by her remarks she has done her bit towards publicising the extra funding. The drama of the announcement of a major closure is given much more coverage than the constant stream of good news about job creation in Scotland. That is the nature of news coverage. I assure my hon. Friend that the job creation picture continues to be positive overall, although some isolated and serious problems have arisen, particularly in recent weeks. I thank my hon. Friend for her comments about the regional selective assistance priority scheme, which is an entirely Scottish initiative
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
and is initially directed at five pilot areas where unemployment is particularly high. It reflects my belief that the best way of giving life and hope back to communities where high unemployment prevails is to put work back into such places.

Can my hon. Friend the Minister assure us that a full public inquiry will be held into the accident's causes to determine the lessons that should be learned from it? Will the Government give urgent consideration to the call by trade unions for the current offshore safety regime to be applied to the onshore industry? Will they also consider the call for the introduction of a new offence of corporate manslaughter? That would provide a way of holding to account oil companies that put great emphasis on production and profit, occasionally at the expense of safety, which can compromise workers' lives in that still too dangerous industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Michie. I shall certainly place my remarks in the context of the economy. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that economic progress should not be made—or purport to be made—at the cost of human lives or if it puts lives in danger. I have great sympathy with each of the points that my hon. Friend raised. Initially, there will be a fatal accident inquiry into the Dundee tragedy, after which further measures will be considered. The Government are considering various proposals on corporate responsibility. When loss of life occurs because of corporate irresponsibility, many of us think that the fact that the law does not allow the relevant body to be called to account is deeply unacceptable and a basic flaw in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Inevitably, and regardless of party politics, the Government of the day say that they are providing enough money and that things are not so bad. The councils say that things are desperate and that they cannot do A, B and C, which they would like to do and are legally bound to do.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Donald Dewar)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The general issue of reprocessing at Dounreay, including outstanding commitments, arose when I met the chief executive of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority on 26 May and again on 5 June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State recall that during Scottish questions some weeks ago, I asked about the future of commercial shipments to Dounreay, but his Minister was unable to answer and covered his inability by bluster?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We made it clear on 5 June that there would be no further commercial contracts for reprocessing at Dounreay. I am sure that the hon. Lady is enthusiastic about the country playing its part as a good international citizen. As she knows, the Georgian uranium was taken on the basis that we were a signatory and a depository nation under the non-proliferation treaty. Our contribution has been very modest compared with that of many other countries, some of which are smaller than Britain. It was obviously important that we should play our part. I hope that I will have the hon. Lady's support and approbation, if she can be gracious enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is the Government's duty to ensure that that is done to the best of our ability. I agree with my hon. Friend that to carp and criticise and unnecessarily to turn the matter into a political issue can be very dispiriting for morale. When we hear rhetoric that refers to Scotland as a nuclear dustbin, it is worth reminding the Committee that Scotland exports about 170 tonnes of nuclear fuel to England every year.

Any way in which we can encourage the extension of the base at Dounreay will be important. I do not need to tell the hon. Gentleman this, but perhaps I could remind others that the rundown at Dounreay will happen over a lengthy period. During that period, skills will be developed in terms of decommissioning.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am simply obeying the instructions of the Clerk of the Committee. If I had not done so, I am sure that the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) would have told me that I had gone wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any debate on the position of Scottish exports is vital, and the timing of the present debate could not be more appropriate. Exporting is crucial to the Scottish economy—150,000 jobs are supported by overseas trade and the value of our exports in 1996–97 was £18.4 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with two principal issues. First, I want to comment on the trading conditions that our exporters face; and secondly, I want to review the support arrangements that are in place to develop the Scottish exporting base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trading conditions faced by our exporters and by potential exporters are extremely difficult. I hope that the debate will provide an opportunity for hon. Members to bring their constituency experience to bear on the practical effects of those trading difficulties. We have heard much difficult news over several months in Scotland. The borders has been in the news in the past few days and there have been severe difficulties because of the job losses at Dawson International. Their effect has stretched into Kinross as well. I know that the Minister visited the borders last week, and I am sure that the hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) will have strong opinions to express on the trading difficulties that the area faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central charge that the Scottish National party makes is that the Government are pursuing an economic policy that is driven by the needs of one part of the country and which does not reflect prevailing trading conditions in Scotland. At a time when exporters are struggling to cope with the challenges of the overvalued pound, the Chancellor of the Exchequer refuses to use any other technique in economic policy than reliance on interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Government inherited a situation in which the pound had been appreciating since September 1996. Since that time, the pound has risen by 40 per cent. against the yen and by 30 per cent. against the deutschmark; it has also strengthened marginally against the strong US dollar. Rather than take the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
necessary corrective fiscal measures to reflect postelection economic conditions, the Chancellor has refused to consider measures that would simultaneously have tightened the economy and allowed greater flexibility to reverse the Tory cuts that have left our public services in a state of decline. The exclusive reliance on interest rate rises has penalised home owners and stretched the margins of Scottish business to, in many cases, an unbearable limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, North and Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us which taxes he would have put up in the Budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipated that intervention. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Chisholm) knows that there are many fiscal measures at the Chancellor's disposal and that he has not even bothered to tamper with a considerable proportion of them. He could, for example, have abolished the ceiling on employees' national insurance contributions, which would have raised revenue and applied some fiscal tightening. He could have increased stamp duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Savidge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with one intervention before moving on to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor could have increased stamp duty on higher price property transactions, which are particularly relevant in the south of England. He could have applied a regionally focused dimension to stamp duty. He could have applied regionally focused cuts in MIRAS. There are many such measures that the Chancellor could have taken, but he decided not to do so. The Chancellor refused to take those necessary fiscal measures and to consider measures that would have tightened the economy and allowed us to tackle the effects of cuts in public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exclusive reliance on interest rate rises has penalised home owners and stretched the margins of Scottish business to the limit. Six interest rate rises have occurred in the past 10 months, each one a blow to the competitiveness of Scottish exporters. At 7.5 per cent., short-term interest rates now stand at 4 per cent. above the expected EU convergence rate of 3.5 per cent. that currently prevails in Germany and France. In simple terms, the roughly 10 per cent. rise in sterling against the deutschmark since Labour took power is translated into an equivalent rise in the price of Scottish goods that are sold on the export market when that price is converted into domestic currency. Scottish business has been placed at a competitive disadvantage in exporting its goods—a hugely damaging position given the success and reliance of the Scottish business community on foreign markets. I hope that the Government will start to listen to the anxious message of Scottish business and exporters regarding these damaging trading conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing figures are beginning to fall, and we appear to be in, or on the brink of, a manufacturing recession. Statistics from the Scottish Council of Development and Industry show two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the manufacturing sector,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
and the projections for the next quarter show the continuance of that trend. These points have been raised not only by the Scottish National party; they are constantly raised by Scottish business representatives. I have had meetings with companies in my constituency that are facing trading difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why have a debate about exporting, and why concentrate on the trading conditions that are faced by Scotland-based exporting companies? The answer to that is clear. Alan Wilson, the chief executive of the Scottish Council of Development and Industry, made the key point in an article that he wrote earlier this year. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scotland has an above average dependence on manufacturing exports and our share of UK manufacturing exports was 11.9 per cent. in 1996, well above our share of UK GDP which stood at 8.5 per cent. in 1995."</p></blockquote>
We have a disproportionate exposure to exports in the Scottish economy. That is welcome: however, it must be reflected in the economic conditions that are created for Scottish companies. The point is simple but crucial. We need relief from the strengthening of the pound. We need a wider focus to economic policy that uses all the tools that are available to encourage stable growth. We need consideration of fiscal policy as well as monetary policy. Scotland needs what new Labour will not deliver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Savidge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that we need to consider fiscal policy. Which of the various proposals for taxes that he was suggesting earlier, such as the abolition of the ceiling on national insurance, are now SNP policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at our 1997 general election manifesto he will see the policy commitments that we made at that time. We are in the process of formulating our policy proposals. The Government are responsible for the economic trading conditions that are the subject of today's debate and that must be survived by Scottish businesses and exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having painted that picture, I turn to the issues that arise from the need to strengthen the trading base of Scotland to maximise our opportunities in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Browne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument about Scotland's over-dependence on exports. Given that our principal market is the rest of the United Kingdom, would the hon. Gentleman agree that, if there were to be an independent Scotland, we would probably become entirely dependent on exports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the first time, the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) completely misses the point. I did not argue that Scotland is over-dependent on exports—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over-exposure was the phrase used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing that our dependence on exporting is fundamental to our economy. We want to strengthen—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] We can check points in the record of our proceedings, when it is produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that Scotland has a broad and diverse export base. That point is fundamental to my
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
argument, and I shall develop it shortly. I am anxious to secure from the Government the appropriate trading conditions to allow our exporters to prosper. They are not being delivered at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Alexander 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have taken interventions on several trivial points from Labour Members. I want to make progress on the substance of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The starting point for the future must be the position of the Scottish Parliament as defined in Labour's legislation. It has limited powers and cannot do anything to improve macro-economic policy—that is something that only an independent parliament could do. I hope that a future independent parliament would take the necessary steps to create the ideal stable economic conditions in which our exporters could prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the new Scottish Parliament can take action to improve the situation, and I want to set out our economic approach to it. In essence, we will seek to mitigate the damaging effects of Westminster's macroeconomic policy, maximise Scotland's influence on the development of economic policy outwith the Scottish Parliament's control, and take strong initiatives in devolved areas so as to deliver effective and distinctive Scottish economic policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make progress. There is more that I want to say. If hon. Members are so anxious to speak, perhaps they can catch your eye, Mrs. Michie, at the conclusion of my speech and participate then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the micro-economic front, we can mitigate Westminster's policies by taking advantage of our increased profile in the world to enhance inward investment and strengthen our exporting presence. As a way of mitigating negative UK policies while maximising our influence abroad, we advocate the development of an "export from Scotland" agency. Such an agency would assume the invaluable work of Scottish Trade International and significantly boost the input to exporting that is delivered by the public agencies within Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formation in- 1995 of Scottish Trade International, which has a budget of £5.8 million, was a welcome boost to the development of exporting in Scotland. In total, Scottish Enterprise spends about £13 million on export support. Exporting has for many years been the poor relation of economic development in Scotland. Despite the persistent activities of organisations such as the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), public sector impetus to export support has lagged behind other flagship features of economic development, such as inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of STI in pursuing an agreed five-year export development strategy—along with the establishment of local networks to give business support and the provision of international marketing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0989">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
support—is essential in taking forward Scottish companies in export markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's argument, but as I have understood it thus far, he quoted someone else saying that we are overexposed, although it is a welcome over-exposure; his argument now seems to imply that we are not exporting successfully. Comparatively, in terms of earnings from exports, we are the most successful part of the United Kingdom. What is the hon. Gentleman's criticism of the status quo in exports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only does the hon. Gentleman miss the point, but he has a poverty of ambition for the Scottish economy. He will hear our central arguments on that point in the remainder of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Scottish companies will not require STI' s support. They may be larger companies with an established exporting presence and needing only practical assistance with developing their plans or contacts. Some such companies are located in my constituency. Other companies—principally small to medium enterprises—will have a greater need. They may need to be persuaded to export in the first place, or they may require a wide range of guidance and support services to cross even the first hurdle of deciding whether to take part. It is essential that we put in place all the mechanisms necessary to guarantee that such services are provided as comprehensively as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the £18.4 billion generated by manufactured exports from Scotland, £16.1 billion comes from larger companies and only £2.3 billion from smaller companies, yet we suffer from the bulk of those exports coming from a narrow base. The export of office machinery and computers accounts for 53 per cent. of Scotland's manufactured exports, while food and drink account for 14 per cent. We should be proud of the good-quality products that we manufacture in these sectors, but we must not lose sight of the fact that 67 per cent. of our manufactured exports comes from the computer/electronics and whisky sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge—I am certain that there will be broad agreement in the Committee about this if about nothing else—is how to increase the number of companies that are participating and the number of sectors that are involved in the process. Diversification is a necessity, not a wish, if we are to improve our exports and better protect our economy against the vagaries of market trends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's speech is commendably measured, compared with what we tend to expect from his leader, the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). Scotland is very successful at exporting electricity to England, and has the potential to export it also to Ireland. How does the hon. Gentleman square that with what the hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) has said from time to time about the need to close down the Scottish nuclear industry? How could we continue to export electricity if Hunterston and Torness were closed down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party is determined, through faint praise, to destroy my reputation in my party. However, the hon. Gentleman asks an important question. The Scottish National party has never made anything other than responsible proposals about the development of our energy sector. Energy is fundamental to the health of the Scottish economy, and we need a broad and diverse range of electricity sources. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Perth would be able to engage the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) in a debate on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that it is not the policy of the Scottish National party to close our nuclear power stations. What would his party do about Scotland's role as a substantial net exporter of what is called nuclear waste?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always recognised that nuclear power stations must be allowed to see out their proper lifetimes. As a responsible Government, we would respond to that process and ensure that it is handled safely and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Trade International does a good and much-complimented job in promoting exports by Scottish companies. However, I question whether it has adequate resources to deliver the strategic plan that it aims to deliver and the export ambitions of many people in Scotland. Our proposals for an exports from Scotland agency are designed to address the questions of scale that are essential to ensure that our export efforts are successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In judging the scale of the task, there is value in looking to our competitors. If global markets teach us one thing, it is the necessity to draw comparisons with all our competitors, for there is only one standard worth attaining. It is not good enough to be the best in the United Kingdom or in the European Union. We must rank among the best in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures for the ratio of exports of goods as a percentage of gross domestic product, show a stark fact. Small economies rely more on exports than large ones. The two largest economies in the world, the United States and Japan, record that exports are 11.4 per cent. and 9.9 per cent. of GDP, respectively. In 1996, the export of goods and services as a percentage of GDP for Belgium was 68.5 per cent., for the Netherlands 53.7 per cent. and for Ireland 76.4 per cent. In Scotland, the most recent comparison will be of the order of 33 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The World Trade Organisation figures show that the Netherlands is the eighth largest exporter in the world, recording exports of $197.1 billion in 1996. Belgium was the 10th largest and although it is by no means within that range, it can point to a doubling of its share of world exports since 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Netherlands operates a single exports agency—The Foreign Trade agency. Each year, it organises 60 major promotional events connecting Dutch enterprise to countries throughout the world. It works through the Dutch network of embassies and consulates to connect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Dutch firms with new markets and to encourage other nations to buy from the Netherlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland, too, can show us how a single-agency approach with broad international representation can have a major impact on export success. We are not advocating matching the fish step for step but simply highlighting the worth of a well-resourced approach. The Irish Trade Board acts as a single agency charged with exporting. Supported by an annual grant of about £33 million, it operates in 33 offices world-wide and has more than 120 staff working to promote Irish exports. The offices promote Irish goods and facilitate Irish exporters wanting to break into new markets. Most tellingly, 75 per cent. of exporters said that they had used the ITB' s market information service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals for an exports from Scotland agency are a contribution to the debate on how best we can take forward the country's exporting strategy. We think that more resources should be allocated to the agency with the purpose of expanding the services that can be provided to Scottish companies and to expand the range of contacts promoting Scotland overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman says about some of the institutional and funding arrangements to promote Scottish exports. Does he agree that the exchange rate must be a key factor? What would be the policy of the Scottish National party for the currency and its exchange rate in an independent Scotland? When would the Scottish pound break from sterling? How would that be negotiated? When would we join European monetary union? What would be the implications for Scottish exporters to the rest of the United Kingdom if sterling were not part of EMU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman is fundamental to the debate and to the future of monetary policy. The position that we took in our election manifesto is understandable and legitimate: the date when Scotland becomes independent to a large extent will dictate the conditions that we face. If the United Kingdom joins economic and monetary union, as I suspect will happen in the reasonably short term—the smiles on the faces of some Labour Members show that that prospect is welcome to them, not surprisingly, as it would mean that they might get the policies that they want—the Scottish economy will be an integral part of the European economy. That is the scenario that I consider most likely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way extensively in the debate, and I want to draw my remarks to a close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is essential to allocate more resources to an exports from Scotland agency to guarantee that the companies and services that are available in Scotland are promoted effectively. We envisage that the increase in the agency's budget should be of the order of about £10 million—a sum that we believe can be identified in Scottish Enterprise's existing budget of £450 million.

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"politicians caught in the headlights of the sterile inward investment debate should consider"</p></blockquote>
the example of Australia. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Money to attract inward investors must still be available but it is equally important to free up serious sums to help indigenous companies realise their potential abroad. Only then can we become more sanguine about the vagaries of the multinational mindset."</p></blockquote>
That quotation raises important issues. We in Scotland acknowledge, appreciate and welcome the strength of the inward-investment base that we have achieved. We warmly congratulate Locate in Scotland on what has been delivered. It is essential to put resources in place to balance the Scottish economy and to give us the opportunity to boost our exporting presence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I make the case for an Exports from Scotland agency, an enhanced Scottish Trade International, better resourced to take our products into new markets and introduce more nations to the high standards of Scottish manufacturing and production. The Scottish National party believes that we need new and challenging ambitions for our economy. Devolution will bring opportunities to deliver some of these ambitions, but until Scotland is able to exercise control over macroeconomic policies, we shall remain at the whim of trading conditions over which we have no say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister responds to this debate, it is essential that he addresses the issues that have been raised about currency strength and its impact on exporters. It is also essential for him to tell the Committee whether he thinks that the Government have all the necessary support in place to deliver an export performance for Scotland that compares well with that of our international partners. That is the challenge that Scotland will want to pass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Education and Industry, Scottish Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been useful, if only to prove a negative, which is how little the Scottish National party has to say about any matter of substance when it is given an opportunity to do so. The SNP selected today's subject. I expected to hear a range of radical proposals and to be told what we are doing wrong. However, fair-minded observers of the debate could only be impressed by the thinness of the speech made by the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney). I agree that he was courteous, which was a welcome change, but it is remarkable how little he had to say.

We were given a few interesting revelations. Necessary fiscal measures were translated from mere euphemism into three commitments on additional taxation—the abolition of the ceiling on an employee's national insurance, an increase in stamp duty and the introduction of regionally focused cuts in mortgage interest relief at source. Disappointingly, the hon. Gentleman did not tell us which regions of Scotland would be affected by regionally focused cuts. Doubtless

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
a press release will list the most prosperous areas of Scotland—I am sure that it will not include the hon. Gentleman's constituency. It would be interesting to hear more about that. I am certain that the three tax-raising proposals would not make a blind bit of difference to the value of the currency, but they would hit hard a large number of families in Scotland.

We received a couple of interesting pieces of information on energy. It is SNP policy that Scotland should continue to be a substantial exporter of nuclear waste to the rest of the United Kingdom because the SNP intends to maintain the nuclear industry for its natural life. We received recognition, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, that electricity sales are important. My word, they are important. At the last count, they were worth £483.6 million to the Scottish economy. The arrangements of export sales in the UK are entirely due to our membership of the UK and the fact that the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must recognise that he should leave some matters to his hon. Friends and that there can indeed be a show without Punch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision about the Yorkshire interconnector, for example, was taken on a UK-wide basis with full regard to the Scottish power generation industry, the Scottish coal industry and so on, yet the hon. Gentleman wants such decisions to be made by a foreign country in relation to another foreign country. As for the hon. Gentleman's substantial proposals, he wants to establish an exports from Scotland agency. I have news for him—we have one. It is called Scottish Trade International and it does a very good job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it comes unnaturally to the Minister to reflect realistically and comprehensively on what is said in debate, but I think that he would acknowledge my compliment that Scottish Trade International is a good agency. What I questioned was whether it has the skill and resources to deliver the ambitions for exporting that my colleagues and I would like to see achieved. I hope that the Minister will address that instead of giving us unrepresentative soundbites.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to do exactly that. I am delighted to recognise that the hon. Gentleman paid tribute to Scottish Trade International. However, I am not sure why it is necessary to change its name and set up an exports from Scotland agency. The hon. Gentleman's fiscal punch line was that the resources of Scottish Trade International were to be increased to £10 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By £10 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting figure. Various parts of the enterprise budget, which the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
recognised, go to Scottish Trade International. A few months ago, I set in train a review of exactly where Scottish Trade International should stand within the enterprise network and what additional autonomy it should have. We shall shortly reach our conclusions on that. Changing the name to the exports from Scotland agency and giving it an extra £10 million—some of which it will almost certainly receive within the present overall enterprise budget—hardly adds up to a revolutionary agenda. The only revolutionary element which the SNP has propounded is that the new agency with new signs outside the door should have its headquarters transferred to Dundee, but, mysteriously, that proposal seems to have disappeared now. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will clarify the matter because the director of Scottish Trade International comes from Dundee and he is not sure whether he wants to return there yet—for reasons I cannot imagine. Does the SNP want the headquarters to be in Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to clarify the matter. The Government's proposal for a Scottish parliament includes a substantive commitment to disperse civil service jobs from the central belt and we are indeed committed to the exports for Scotland agency having its headquarters in Dundee. The headquarters of Scottish Trade International is in Glasgow and there are advantages in continuing that presence, but the principal headquarters of the exports for Scotland agency should be in Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the headquarters of Scottish Trade International should be in Glasgow and the headquarters of the exports from Scotland agency should be in Dundee. That is interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the Minister against Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am immensely in favour of Dundee, but I am also immensely in favour of Glasgow. We should be more rational in deciding where agencies are to be located. I simply want to clarify whether the intention of the SNP is still that the headquarters of the exports from Scotland agency will be in Dundee. The only radical proposal seems to be that Scotland's exports should be doubled overnight by turning England into a foreign country. That is the reality underlying some of the Irish statistics. Ireland has a high level of exports because a high percentage of them go to England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand that all these countries are European?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, will products going to Europe not be described as exports? I do not follow the logic of the hon. Lady's argument. Statistics have been quoted on Irish exports, but it is significant that 25 per cent. of those exports go straight across the channel. Ireland calls them exports, so why does not the hon. Lady also call them exports?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Virtually everything that the hon. Member for North Tayside mentioned is being done. I have no doubt that there could be some improvement—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Humility is no bad thing and the hon. Gentleman should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0992">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
try it. The hon. Gentleman referred only to manufactured exports. I wonder why he did not refer to the financial service companies only a short distance from here. They are important exporters of services and many have 90 per cent. of their business in other parts of the United Kingdom, which the hon. Gentleman wants to turn into a foreign country—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall certainly give way, but if Scotland is to be an independent state, surely other independent states will be foreign countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the implications of the European Union's third life directive on the financial services sector in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is remarkable that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues cannot give a straight answer to a straight question. If they create an independent state, would other countries be seen as foreign countries and sovereign states, or would they not? Despite having 16 years to think about it, the SNP could not tell us, in response to the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland, the basis on which the currency would be valued in an independent state. We do not know what the future holds for any part of the United Kingdom on entry to the European monetary system and it is possible that there will be different currency levels. Surely the Scottish National party has given some thought to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister a simple question about the implications of the third life directive for the Scottish financial services sector. I thought that he, as the Minister responsible for industry in Scotland, would be aware of the important protection that that gives to countries in the European Union. Will he comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am honest, so I am happy to say that I do not know enough about it to give a sufficiently detailed answer now; I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on the subject. I have answered his question directly—will he answer one directly: does an independent state have a relationship with foreign independent states? It is bizarre, to say the least, that his hon. Friends guffaw when I say that they are trying to turn England into a foreign country. Their silence now is more eloquent than anything they have said on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland asked a pertinent question about the value of the pound in an independent Scotland compared with the pound sterling? Scottish National Members have twice slid away from answering that question, but they seem to be inviting the Scottish people to vote for independence without having a clue what the Scottish pound would be worth. Does my hon. Friend agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree. One wishes that the audience for our sitting were larger because we are facing two fundamental questions. The first is whether an independent Scotland would be separate from, and regard as foreign, other countries, including England; nationalist Members cannot answer that. [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah!"] First they guffaw and now they sigh.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Will England have the same relationship to Scotland as other European countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he does not know about the third life directive; has he heard of the single European market and does he understand its implications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have and I do. However, it would be an odd proposition for other EU countries not to be partners to an economic union, while retaining their status as independent sovereign states—which is, as the hon. Gentleman knows well, the current situation. I find it a mystery that Scottish Nationals cannot simply admit that they are trying to turn England into a foreign country—an exporting market—and that Scotland would make its own political decisions on issues such as energy. They constantly try to play a three-card trick by having all the apparatus of separatism while disguising from the Scottish people the implications of economic separatism. They will continue to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has had one crack at the subject. The second point, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) rightly said, is that the Scottish Nationals do not know about the valuation of the currency and its relationship to UK currency and therefore do not have a clue about the impact of their proposal on Scottish business, particularly the Scottish financial sector. Perhaps 90 per cent. of that sector's clientele is from other parts of the United Kingdom. At the first whiff of different currency valuations and taxation arrangements, the sector would protect its interests by refusing to be part of Scotland, as it would refuse to be part of any other member state that had such consequences on their business. Such truths must be spoken. Scottish Nationals cannot be allowed to hide behind fine words. We are talking not about an abstract argument, but about tens of thousands of jobs that are at risk from the airy-fairy economics that we have heard from the nationalists this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the reason that nationalists do not speak for long on the Scottish financial services sector is perhaps because they are embarrassed, as a party, by the fact that one of their own researchers recently recommended a boycott of one of that sector's leading companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the fact that Mr. Mike Ross has not been intimidated into silence and I hope that he and many others will continue to speak up about the implications of the policies propounded by the nationalists.

We recognise the need to diversify the range of Scottish exporters and the markets to which they export. We recently established the Scottish exports campaign, which aims to get 500 additional companies exporting by the turn of the century. The export strategy also identifies 12 priority country markets, which offer particular opportunities for Scottish companies. STI has established its office in eight of those countries and representatives and consultants in the others. They work on a one-to-one basis with companies, offering
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0993">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
intensive support in market entry and development programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister saw for himself last week that some of the qualify exporters, especially textile producers in the borders, believe that they are being held back by unfair trade conditions perpetrated by sister European nations. He knows that a garment knitted with Scottish-spun yarn was £20 cheaper in the market places of Europe. Does the apparatus to support export enterprise in Scotland—through STI or whatever—have a way of checking reported incidents of unfair practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every such incident will be checked. In the specific case quoted by the hon. Gentleman, there has been an allegation of the use of child labour in an EU member country. Ostensibly that does not seem probable, but we have the name of the company and, in partnership with the Department of Trade and Industry, we will check the allegation and report on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last month, I announced that Brazil was to be added to our list of priority country markets and that an STI office would open there later this year in Sao Paolo—our first in south America. That will give Scottish exporters an important foothold not only in Brazil, but in south America as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of our priority markets is the United Arab Emirates, and I am pleased to announce that later this year we will be extending our overseas network with the opening of an STI office in Dubai. As in other STI offices overseas, staff in the new Dubai office will work specifically to assist Scottish companies enter and develop their business, this time in the middle east. This type of support has paid dividends to companies in other STI office locations from Beijing to Bombay, and in Germany and the USA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that the oil contracting sector—in particular, north-east Scotland' s expertise in the North sea—has the opportunity to exploit the thriving markets of south America, the middle east and elsewhere? STI could use that sector as an export industry further to develop Scotland's economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree. There is a fantastic potential for oil-related companies in the north-east that have developed off the back of North sea oil and which now have a worldwide role. There are spectacular examples of that and we should be pursuing that growth sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman gave a good example of how we benefit from being represented in 198 countries of the world. Oil-related activity does not take place in just the 31 countries of the world that Scotland might choose to select along the lines of the fish model. If we told people in the oil industry that Scotland and their businesses will get a good deal by withdrawing diplomatic and trade presence from 167 countries in order to assert the right to have our own presence in 31 countries, we would get a dirty response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I realise that it is a delicate issue, but it ought to be discussed frankly with the Dubai authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it is a delicate issue, I shall say no more about it this morning, but I shall write to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stress the importance of the structure of the export partnerships that now cover every area of Scotland. They involve enterprise companies, local authorities and chambers of commerce and offer a one-stop facility for every company in Scotland that might be interested in exporting. That is a useful tool and it has developed fairly recently. I freely admit that we inherited it. It is a good structure, which should be known to every company. Every company should be encouraged to examine the possibility of exporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Trade International organises Scottish pavilions at about 30 international trade exhibitions and a range of organisations arranges trade missions in conjunction with it. In recent months, we have also developed the concept of Scotland the Brand. We have recognised that Scotland enjoys a positive association in the minds of many international consumers with quality products and services. So far, Scotland the Brand has attracted 87 applications, of which 53 have been granted. The promotional unit charged with that task—Scotland the Brand—is funded by Scottish Enterprise and is part of Scottish Trade International.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our recent ventures—a new idea that worked very well—was to link the marketing of Scotland's trade and tourism with its participation in the world cup and to build on the back of the positive image that Scottish supporters generated by their presence in France. It was an extremely successful venture and has generated a great deal of good will. There will be solid trade achievements as well, judging by the response that Scottish goods received. It was a delight, in Bordeaux and in the other cities in which Scotland was involved, to see supermarkets with Scottish products prominently displayed. The Scotland the Brand logo was used widely. It was a successful undertaking, and I strongly recommend that Scotland's presence on the world stage in sporting and, indeed, cultural terms should be linked in future to developing trade and tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In seeking to support Scottish exports and exporters, we have paid close attention to advice from the private sector. Sir Alistair Grant, the governor of the Bank of Scotland and chairman of Scottish and Newcastle plc, is, for example, chairman of our Scotland the Brand advisory board. We have had representations from a wide range of business interests on the Scottish export forum, which meets three times a year and which I chair. At its most recent meeting, we had a useful debate on whether and to what extent the Government should assist Scottish business with outward investment strategies—in other words, in situations in which businesses wanted to acquire companies overseas, set up manufacturing or service facilities overseas or undertake joint ventures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the debate on outward investment at the forum deal with the potential undermining of the focus on exports that might result from pursuing a strategy that, I think the Minister will accept, is very different from an exporting strategy, in terms of the acquisition of companies and of other interests abroad? Was there any debate about the mismatch that might be created within the strategy as a result of pursuing such a course?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is clear potential for Scottish companies to go out into the world, develop their expertise, perhaps to expand and then to relate back to Scotland, from which they originated. One good example of that is the Scottish Software Centre in San Jose, which I opened a few weeks ago. We plan to open another in Northern Virginia later in the year. Scottish Trade International sets up such a software centre, and Scottish companies can go out there, team up with other companies in the industry and, I hope, expand. However, they always have the Scottish base, and their expertise and capital should feed back into the Scottish economy. STI has recently also assisted in a spectacular venture with Bans plc to undertake a deal whereby Irn Bru will be manufactured under licence in Moscow. That is another example of how we support Scottish products in getting into new markets, but with the emphasis on job creation at home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could describe many other facets of STI's work, but I have gone on long enough and do not want to prevent others from speaking. It is important to recognise that, outside the structures of government, I am constantly impressed by the companies—many of them longstanding, indigenous Scottish companies—that are out in the field working extremely hard for the Scottish economy. Often, they were there before there were any structures. That applies to the whisky industry, many of whose representatives are based in the constituency of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), and to heavy engineering companies such as Weirs and Yarrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One meets people who travel the world to win substantial orders for such companies. They often work in the most remote parts, where infrastructure is at an early stage of development and where there are big orders to be won. In every instance, they work closely with the United Kingdom diplomatic and trade presence in those countries. That is a vital asset to our overall efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many factors contribute to exporters' current difficulties. The strong pound is one, but anyone who talks exclusively about the strong pound should have been in the borders last week to hear about the complexity of difficulties that the companies affected are undergoing. The factor whose impact and complexity I had underestimated is the Asian crisis. That is having an impact on us not only because of a drop in investment from the far east, but because the far eastern market for many companies has virtually collapsed—people are not buying. Furthermore, there is ever more cut-throat competition from imported goods produced by countries with economic problems. They will produce and export goods at minimal cost, just to get currency into the country and to maintain economic activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Finally—this is particularly relevant to the textiles industry—because of the problems in the Japanese economy, we are not seeing the same number of Japanese tourists and they are not buying knitwear and other high-quality products, although some companies are largely dependent on such sales. The Asian crisis is thus impacting in a range of ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish where I started. It would be entirely wrong to give an overall impression of doom and gloom. Scottish manufacturing output rose by 7 per cent. last year. Many of our exporters are in extremely good heart and doing very well. There is no doubt that the Scottish exporting sector has held up better in difficult conditions than the rest of the United Kingdom. Let us not talk down the efforts either of the Government or of individual companies. Such pessimism could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Scottish exporters are in good heart, much more remains to be done. Many more good companies could and should be exporting and many more Scottish manufacturing products and services could be sent to the rest of the world. The best way of doing that is undoubtedly by harnessing the best of both worlds: the strength of the United Kingdom in every corner of the world, allied to the effectiveness of our own agency, Scottish Trade International.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to it. The Scottish Liberal Democrats recognise Scotland's great exporting history and we are committed to strengthening Scotland's capability in that regard. However, we share with many others alarm at the current problems facing Scotland's manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, its service sector. While the Minister is right to say that these are not exclusively Government problems, certainly the Government's policies have created and exacerbated many problems for Scotland's manufacturers. There are longer term structural difficulties in the Scottish economy, which are not yet being tackled by the Minister and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the importance of exports to the Scottish economy. That cannot be in doubt. The hon. Member for North Tayside talked about 150,000 jobs being directly dependent. We can add to that figure 300,000 other jobs that are indirectly dependent on exports. The estimate for last year's overseas exports total was £20.6 billion. The same survey by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) estimates that there was a 4 per cent. fall in Scotland's exports in the first quarter of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can see around us the pain that is already being felt. Last September, the Donside paper company said that the strength of the pound would cause the loss of 129 jobs. In April, Fullarton in Renfrewshire announced the loss of 350 jobs, again attributing that to the strength of sterling. Last October, 290 jobs were lost at Dawson International. A few weeks ago, Viasystems in the borders announced the loss of 210 jobs, due once more to the strength of sterling. Following his visit last week, the Minister is only too aware of the devastation that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0995">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
loss of 720 jobs at Dawson International is wreaking on the local economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That gives just a flavour of what is happening and the pain that is being endured. Not only are jobs being lost, but many others who have kept their jobs are now on short-time working: one week on, one week off. In companies that have not yet reached that stage, many talk about the way in which their profit margins are being eroded, because of which they cannot rule out taking further measures in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to spend much time explaining the situation to the Minister because we sat in the same meetings last week in the borders. The directors at Viasystems in Selkirk and at Peter Scott in Hawick put it to him, courteously but bluntly, that the level of the pound, which has increased by approximately 20 per cent. in value, means that not even the most efficient manufacturers in the world—of which we have many in Scotland—can hope to compete. The SCDI states in its latest bulletin. that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the pound continues to he significantly overvalued … The effect … on the Scottish economy, ever dependent on exports, is yet to be fully felt, but 1998 and 1999 will be difficult years for business."</p></blockquote>
That view was echoed by the Confederation of British Industry in its most recent "Business Strategies Regional Trends Survey" in May. Two thirds of those surveyed reported increasing pessimism about exports and 60 per cent. reported declining optimism about export orders and deliveries for the next four months. Two thirds of the participants attributed their pessimism to the exchange rate's impact on prices, while a quarter attributed it to overseas economic problems such as the Asian crisis. The Minister highlighted the significance of the Asian crisis, and I do not intend to play it down, but he should understand the comparative significance of the value of the pound. Neil Parker of the Royal Bank of Scotland was quoted last week as having said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Manufacturers are giving up the ghost and laying off parts of their workforce since orders are not sufficient to warrant current staffing levels."</p></blockquote>
The Government have received this information at first hand from ministerial visits and from elsewhere, but warnings have been coming for some time. Economists readily point out that UK interests rates are the key to exchange rates, which have been described by Bob Ballantine of the SCDI as
	<br><blockquote><p>"well outside the comfort zone for Scottish exporters."</p></blockquote>
As we have heard, interest rates have risen six times since the Government came to power, and economists have been warning of the consequences from day one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrat Members applauded the Chancellor's decision to give the Bank of England responsibility for interests rates. We supported the principle of taking interest rate decisions away from the political gambling instincts of Chancellors such as Lawsons, Lamont and the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). However, at that time nobody realised that the new Chancellor was giving the old lady a hospital pass—that is, responsibility for inflation with no support from the Treasury. In the face of a consumer boom we are being told that we must accept a manufacturing bust. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
due to the Chancellor's unwillingness to target fiscal tightening on consumers rather than on businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second way in which the Government could relieve pressure on Scotland's exporters is to make an early decision on entry into EMU. That decision has been left in limbo for too long. Scotland's exporters currently have the worst of all possible worlds. They have continuing uncertainty about when we may join the euro, they have the costs of preparing to deal in euros with their existing overseas customers and they have an over-valued pound, which is due partly to the hyping up of speculators who are wondering about the future situation with regard to the single currency. If there is any doubt about that, we should look back to last autumn. One day, the Chancellor predicted early entry into EMU and some heat was immediately taken out of the value of sterling; the next day, the Prime Minister rebuffed his colleague and the speculation premium of the pound. That approach has applied ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The over-valued pound is the single biggest factor affecting Scottish exports, but longer-term and more deep-seated problems also need to be tackled. Scotland's exports are denominated by two sectors—electronics and whisky, which have accounted for two thirds of manufacturing exports for a number of years. Much of the strong electronics performance comes on the back of the highly successful record of inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Trade International appears to recognise over-dependence on those two sectors. Evidence submitted to the inquiry into inward and outward investment being carried out by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs makes much of the five-year export development strategy launched in 1995. The strategy involves an export forum, a national exports campaign, programme of action, 12 priority markets, eight priority sectors and umpteen export partnerships. If all else fails, there will clearly be a future market for exporting surplus jargon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy is three-year old, and we are constantly told that the export support network has been restructured to provide companies with a more effective and coherent service. Students of logic or English can be left to work out the coherence. The effectiveness of the strategy has, however, yet to be proven. A closer look at the strategy shows that textiles are a priority sector, and South Korea a priority market. People in the borders may allow themselves a wry smile at that, at a time of unprecedented retrenchment in the local textile industry. The Minister's visit to the borders last week was important, and Liberal Democrats welcome the measures that he announced then. As my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and I have said, however the Minister was providing the start of the answer rather than the complete answer to the current economic disasters that effect the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the visit, besides the strong pound, marketing was highlighted time and again as a key sector to which the £1 million announced for Scottish Borders Enterprise might be targeted. There is certainly room for improvement in the Government's efforts on this matter so far. One exasperated manufacturer recently told me that officials were boasting about a £60,000 consultant study for textile exports to Korea.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0996">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
He pointed out that that is roughly half the cost of the one seasonal fashion shoot in west Scotland that he uses to promote his business every year. We are told that there will he no follow up because of current difficulties in South Korea. Surely now is exactly the time when Scotland should be investing time in marketing in such overseas economies, to ensure that it is well placed to be part of the upturn when it comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further to that, a number of rumours have been circulating, suggesting that the funding provided by Scottish Enterprise for the Scottish Textile Association is to dry up. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay those fears. Surely, at now of all times, that should not be at stake. If that is how priority sectors and markets are being looked after, pity the less favoured of Scotland's exporters. Sonic people might suggest that pity or sympathy is all that they can realistically expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although STI boasts that all partnerships now have support from an export partnership counsellor, that is not actually true. Three years since the start of the strategy, 25 per cent. of export partnerships have no counsellor in place. In the boarders, advertisements for the post have appeared only in the past couple of weeks. Too many small businesses fail to get the support that they need. To become more diversified, Scotland must encourage small businesses as the exporters of tomorrow. The Federation of Small Businesses reports that its members find the organisation set up to help them too slow, too cumbersome and ineffective to boot. One highland food company has virtually given up on its attempts to export, as its efforts to find a suitable agent overseas have been thwarted. Given that Scottish business failures in the first half of 1998 increased by 10.5 per cent. compared with the first half of 1997, such an experience is all too depressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland's export performance—as we can see all around us—is crunching into reverse. The Government's economic policy is costing jobs, creating short-time working and fostering terrible insecurity. The future health of Scottish exports is still over-dependent on too few sectors. The export strategy adopted by the Government has not turned the situation around and is not focused where it needs to be. To avoid further disasters in the Scottish economy—in my area of the borders and elsewhere in Scotland—the Government must urgently rethink their strategy on the pound and how they focus their efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Brazil is a burgeoning market and of great importance.

	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Last week, I attended the all-day seminar at Canning house. First, will the expertise of Canning house be taken into account in the setting up of the Sao Paolo centre? It has an enormous amount of expertise, not least on the southern part of Brazil, which is the motor engine of the Brazilian economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I interrupted the Minister on the question of Dubai and I shall ask a second succinct question. Could officials have a word with constituents of mine—Mr. and Mrs. Davidson of Linlithgow—who are related to George Atkinson, who is the business man in prison in Dubai? I am sure that some good will could resolve the situation, and it should be given attention. If the Scottish Office is setting up representation in Dubai, it must at least know the background to this sore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue that I wish to raise concerns the paper industry and Westfield Mill. I have received letters from Mr. Kay and Mr. Corry on the matter. Mr. Corry wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For a number of years now, we have built up a successful export market in our one-side coated papers that are used primarily for labelling and packaging applications. Total exports account for some 60 per cent. of our output, approximately half of which is within the EEC. At the present moment, not only is this business under threat, but the business we have in the UK is also being threatened by imports of paper, mainly from European paper mills that are taking advantage of the strength of sterling to gain business by cutting sterling prices. This situation cannot continue for too long before this mill is in the same position as the graphics paper mills.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Some 200 people are employed at Westfield Mill."</p></blockquote>
I know from my experience as a member of the all-party paper industry group that this is a serious situation. Will the Minister's officials contact Westfield and Inveresk to ascertain what can be done? The Minister might ask, "What is your solution?" I would have to say that I am one of a small minority who have pleaded with the Chancellor time and again to enter the European single currency at the first possible opportunity. Such a move would create better conditions; but perhaps that is another argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—you have asked us to be quick, Mrs. Michie—I would like to return for one moment to an aspect of the Lockerbie case. This is not the occasion to discuss the ins and outs of the questions that were raised this morning. Apart from the wishes of the relatives, there is a serious issue involving British trade with Libya and the Arab world—Libya was one of our traditional markets. If Babcocks had retained the normal market some years ago it would not have paid off 440 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter that I raised with the Scottish Office was discussed by the British Libyan Business Group on 17 June. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The BLBG has received a number of worried calls from Members who have heard rumours that an embargo has been placed on British exports to Libya. The BLBG immediately sought clarification and reliable sources have confirmed that Libya has placed an embargo on goods from Portugal, Canada, Australia and Japan, as well as the UK. Although not a full embargo, UK companies will now have to apply for a licence through the Libyan National Committee Assembly for every transition and every contract."</p></blockquote>
That is a serious matter, and the Scottish Office should examine it</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to speak briefly on an extremely important matter that affects
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0997">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Scotland's future. The hon. Member for North Tayside clearly set out the opportunities that the SNP's export from Scotland unit would create for Scotland's exporters. That positive strategy contrasts with the harm that the Government's policies are causing to key industries—there is no coherent Government strategy to promote Scotland, and the Government have failed to offer additional assistance to our small and medium exporting businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters have particular resonance in my part of the country, which illustrates some of the wider issues that must be tackled. Angus contains large and small-scale agricultural and manufacturing businesses, and it is the base for a range of expert concerns, including the oil exploration and supply industry and world-renowned quality food producers, such as Aberdeen Angus beef, R. and R. Spink from Arbroath, Mackays and Low and Duff from Carnoustie, and many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, we have a stable and successful local economy, but it is held back by the lack of co-ordinated assistance in terms of export promotion, and it is deeply affected by the twin hurdles of high interest rates and a damagingly strong pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that the Minister will by now have read the disturbing findings of the most recent Bank of Scotland survey of 300 manufacturing and service sector businesses in Scotland. The report clearly shows that over the past eight months there have been steady falls in manufacturing and output in Scotland, and a continuing fall in export orders. The panel members state that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"decreased competitiveness on foreign markets arising from the strong pound"</p></blockquote>
is the villain of the piece.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures show that there has been a steady decline in the level of new orders since the turn of the year and that export orders have fallen month by month, which in turn has led to a further reduction in manufacturing employment. That trend has continued since October last year, and we want the Government to deal with the problem. They cannot ignore the strong pound, which is always quoted as the villain of the piece.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the problems facing the beef industry in Scotland. When the European ban is finally lifted to allow the export of our quality beef, additional assistance will be required to promote our exports. We must match our international competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the efforts made by the Irish and Quebecois Governments to develop niche markets for their food products. We need a clear promotion strategy to ensure that Scottish produce is given an extra boost to help us to compete effectively. In the post-BSE era it will be important to identify the qualities of Scottish beef products. Scotland the Brand should be promoted in that context—it will give our exporters an extra cutting edge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing and engineering still make a significant contribution to the economy and there is Scottish expertise in the oil industry. In niche markets such as oil exploration and engineering a specific export promotion unit would have a favourable impact. We have a wealth of expertise and knowledge that could be
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
sold world wide and which could assist smaller companies in their efforts to gain access to foreign markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much can be learned from the Irish trade board, which, in its reincarnation as Enterprise Ireland, will link export promotion with the development of assistance for small and medium-sized indigenous industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to see information and technical support, the presence of Scottish business promotion staff in key markets, and specific promotion techniques such as piggy-backing of smaller manufacturers with more established exporters. A Scottish export unit could educate purchasers in target areas about the quality of Scotland's agriculture, manufacturing and other industries. A Scottish export unit could also advance the frontiers of internet promotion of Scotland and Scottish produce. Prior to this morning's debate, my staff surfed the net to access the UK's own export promotion web pages and those of competitor nations. Although the Scottish trade board has an attractive presence on the web, the image of tartan and whisky—which is central to much of the site—is not the cutting-edge image that our high technology and engineering businesses need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily, and by default, Scotland's competitors also have gaps in their presence on the internet. For example, the international business promotion pages for the Quebecois and Catalan Governments do not offer browsers the easy access to information that would encourage contact with companies from either nation. A clear opportunity therefore exists for Scotland to take the lead in the development of export promotion in this growing marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A business-minded Scottish Government should ensure that our internet site provides clear information on a range of Scottish industrial opportunities and products. More importantly, the site must offer easy contact points with both the export unit and individual companies, so that a first contact on the web can develop into firm orders for Scottish goods. Scotland's export record is a good one, but it is narrowly based. The SNP have the highest ambitions for Scotland—we want to see Scotland's name and produce at the forefront of world markets. Our proposed exports promotion unit is an exciting idea that will be welcomed by businesses throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Parliament will have the opportunity to develop national strategies to maximise Scottish economic effort. We must get Scottish people off the dole queue and back to work. Scotland has the skills, the talent and the ability; it has the raw materials and the quality products. The task is to harness those assets for economic progress, and to ensure that Scotland's exports build the nation's future prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Given that I genuinely believe in the new collaborative politics in Scotland, I had hoped that today's debate would reveal a policy area where the SNP had something positive to contribute. However, other than a deafening but significant silence on financial services
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0998">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
exports, its sole contribution today is a renaming of the export agency and some fine words about the importance of exports is small businesses, and vice versa. We agree with that. All that we have done during our first year in Government shows the new significance that we attach to the role of small businesses in exports. If the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welsh) examines the Finance Bill—unlike his leader, who recently made a speech on it without looking at it—he will find that it contains many measures for small businesses. Those measures include the university challenge and Scottish Office initiatives such as the national export campaign, the growing business fund and the business support unit. Government strategy is therefore directed precisely at that sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SNP's real objective during the debate was a negative carp about macro-economic policy. Indeed, it has given new meaning to "negative capability", the famous phrase that was coined by John Keats. That is all that we get, without any coherent policy whatever. It complains about the exchange rate, yet its election manifesto expressed an intention to shadow the pound, which would have had the same consequences. To be fair, SNP Members do not, as others do, criticise the Bank of England's independence. The Government's problems have arisen precisely because the Tories, for political reasons, did not put up interest rates before the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some suggestions were made about fiscal policy. We were particularly interested in the SNP's view on MIRAS. House prices are increasing more in the east of Scotland than in any other part of the United Kingdom, excluding the south east of England. From that we will draw the conclusion that the SNP wants to reduce MIRAS in the east of Scotland, at least. Its macroeconomic policy is not credible. In fact, for the past two months it has complained about too much fiscal tightening. The belief that the piling up of cash surpluses would allow interest rates to fall is highly debatable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is up, but we know to our cost that the failure of the SNP to acknowledge the many positive achievements that I mentioned when referring to the OECD report. Government policy is aimed at tackling poverty and special exclusion and helping those on low incomes. As the hon. Member for North Tayside said on the radio recently when referring to the economic policy of an independent Scotland, the SNP would simply hope for the best. The Scottish people are not prepared to accept a fingers-crossed economic policy and will not jeopardise their living standards by voting for the SNP.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sending the message that when people are working hard in business and enterprise, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Government's role is to provide a supportive framework and not to damage that enterprise. The words "level playing field" are a cliché, but an important one. If countries in the European Union and the open supermarket provide subsidies to counteract currency problems, but our Government does not, problems are created for exports. If regulations applying only to the United Kingdom increase costs and charges, exports are undermined if those charges are not applied across the European Union. If the Government could work with the European Union to ensure that such costs and charges apply across the board, I would welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly accepted that the oil support industry is an important export industry. But, like all export industries, the home market is a crucial foundation for those exports. Perhaps the Minister would explain why the consultation paper on the oil industry and taxation, which he promised for mid-April, has not yet been published. The uncertainty has not helped industries in the north-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Minister accepts that tourism is an important part of the export market. Anything that can be done to promote tourism will be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for North Tayside. It is debatable whether my hon. Friend has any faults, but if he has one, it is that his over-positive approach is too kind to the Government. It was extraordinary that the Minister accused my hon. Friend of making a negative speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in the papers that the Minister is enjoying his valedictory performance in the Committee. It is unfortunate that he should strike such a tone in his leaving performance. I read that the great strategy of the Labour party to recover ground from the SNP is to move the Minister of State to a London Department. Clearly, some people in the Labour party believe that his absence from Scottish politics would be more beneficial than his presence. His response to my hon. Friend today confirmed that opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister totally missed the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside about overheating of the economy, particularly in south-east England. The Government's response in passing responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England has been six interest rate rises, but those perceived inflationary pressures are largely concentrated in the economy of south-east England. When my hon. Friend suggested measures involving stamp duty and MIRAS to tackle that overheating on a regional basis, the Minister merely scoffed—showing a total incomprehension of legitimate policies to tackle inflationary pressures where they arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
country. His suggestion was that the problem should be tackled in south-east England. What have the Government done to tackle overheating in the economy of south-east England? They are investing £1 billion in the construction industry and a dome beside the River Thames. If money is to be spent in south-east England and London, would it not have been better to invest in social housing to take the edge off the London property markets, which is causing so much damage to the management of economic policy? The regional imbalances in the United Kingdom economy have caused constant problems for Governments in drawing up their economic policies over the past 50 years. The Government have signally failed to implement any initiative to counteract those imbalances and to tackle inflationary pressure at source. When my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside suggested some initiatives, he was scoffed at by a Minister who has failed to understand the problems facing the United Kingdom economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that Scottish National party Members would find it difficult to say that the rest of the United Kingdom and our European partners would be independent countries in the European Union. We have no difficulty in saying that: what we find difficult is the assumption that that would be a problem for Scottish exporters in selling Scottish goods. The Minister implied that we could not sell Scottish electricity in the English market after independence. In that case, how do the French sell electricity to England through the interconnector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister implied that financial services would face difficulties. However, on his own admission, the Minister with responsibility for trade and industry in Scotland did not understand, or acknowledge, the existence of the third life directive and its importance for financial services in the single European market. I remember that a candidate in Govan had some difficulty with the concept of additionality, but he was a mere parliamentary candidate. I have never heard of a Minister with responsibility for industry who did not understand the importance of the third life directive in the European economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister claims that the main difficulty in making decisions about the euro is the convergence between the UK and other European economies. The Scottish economy is far more in synchronisation with those of our European partners. If the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer could agree about the euro and say—as Liberal Democrat Members have said and as Scottish National Party Members are prepared to say—that they favoured in principle entry at a competitive rate, subject to the decision of the Scottish people, that would apply significant downward pressure on sterling. It is extraordinary that the Minister of State does not acknowledge the serious difficulty caused by sterling to many Scottish exporters and to all internationally tradeable services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On 3 July, the 	<i>Perthshire Advertiser</i> reported that the chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, the hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"I fully appreciate that these redundancies are not due to the internal management of the firm so much as the disadvantage UK exporters have when in competition with other currencies at the current overvalued nature of the pound.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I hope this will act as a warning to the Government to act as soon as possible to protect British and Scottish jobs."</p></blockquote>
The chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry acknowledges that the problems in his constituency are reflected across Scotland. Why cannot the Minister also acknowledge that? Why does not he consult his hon. Friend about the actions that he has suggested to reduce the value of sterling to give Scottish exports a chance?

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1000">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
The central argument of my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside was how we should promote Scottish exports; his approach was positive and constructive. I think back to the early 1980s when a similar debate took place about how we would attract inward investment to Scotland. Many in the Conservative and Labour parties said that we should seek refuge in the Invest in Britain Bureau; indeed, the famous Select Committee on Scottish Affairs undertook a report into that. Fortunately for Scotland, the Secretary of State at the time, Lord Younger, overruled that Select Committee and decided on the Scottish approach, through Locate in Scotland, to which he gave enhanced authority as the single door to inward investment. My hon. Friend argues that we should give STI the same priority, so that it becomes the single window of opportunity for Scottish exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister waved aside the point that STI might be under-resourced. STI has a budget of £5 million; £30 million is spent elsewhere in export promotion and the Irish Trade Board, which draws so much international admiration, has a budget of 33 million punts. If we are being out-resourced by some of our major competitors, the least that the Minister could do is acknowledge that that is a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strongest part of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside was his willingness to acknowledge the problems that the Government's lack of definition in economic policy is causing the Scottish economy. That is the reality that hon. Members must face when they consult companies in their constituencies. The Minister—even in his final speech—would do well to acknowledge my hon. Friend's constructive proposals to boost the position of Scottish exporters. Such positive suggestions will win the hearts and minds of the Scottish people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, may I say that that was a very poor contribution? The hon. Gentleman is supposed to have a reputation as an economist; I should have thought it easy for him to answer the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) on whether it was still SNP policy for the Scottish pound to shadow sterling. He cannot or will not answer that question, because to do so would tear his empty rhetoric to shreds. He should give a simple answer—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
thought that a party whose only policy is independence would at least have some clue about what it intended to do about currency under independence. The SNP's failure to declare its policy on that is revealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then tried, rather desperately, to reinforce the bizarre concept of regional cuts in MIRAS. I asked what regions of Scotland would be involved, because any fool knows that house inflation in some Scottish regions is high compared with that in other parts of the UK. When one takes away the rhetoric, one sees that his policy is for such cuts to be applied in south-east England—which would mean that poor people in that area would be subject to cuts while Scotland is to be entirely immune from them. It is just nonsense, and the hon. Gentleman knows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to ask an important question about Scottish energy exports and the position of the Scottish coal and nuclear industries; we all know that the SNP is committed to preserving the nuclear industry, with the large net export of Scottish nuclear waste—to what will be the foreign country of England. He then asked why the French sell into the UK, and gave his own masterly reply. In fact, any idiot knows exactly why the French sell into the UK—because the Tories were daft enough to sign a binding contract at the time of the miners' strike. If the hon. Gentleman now commends that policy, he has a very odd set of priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Finally, we return to the question of Locate in Scotland. Rewriting history is a quintessential part of nationalism. The one certainty is that the Scottish National party had nothing to do with the establishment of Locate in Scotland. The Labour Government of the 1970s set up the Scottish Development Agency and gave it limited powers to attract inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan was right about one thing, at least: there was an inquiry by the Scottish Select Committee, which had a Tory majority and was Chaired by the Secretary of State for Scotland, my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (Mr. Dewar). If I remember correctly, one Tory came over to vote with Labour Members. The result was that the Committee—quite rightly with the support of Lord Younger—delivered Locate in Scotland.

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
of the many matters on which the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan chose not to touch was the question of what we would do if we followed the Irish example—the result of which would be that Scotland would lose its diplomatic or trade presence in 167 countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) referred to the success of oil-related ventures overseas. We have won £20 million in exports over the past two years through the Scottish-Caspian trade venture based in Baku. Oil-related ventures are in hand also in Azerbaijan, Australia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Venezuela. Yet the Irish, with 31 trade presences in the world, are held up as an example. Scotland has 198 such presences, including one in each of the countries that I have mentioned. The Scottish National party is prepared to throw all that away to assert the right to have 31 outposts in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell raised some detailed points, to which I shall respond in writing to the Committee. However, I want
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
to return to what the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Welch) said. I wish that the Scottish National party would make up its mind. The hon. Member for North Tayside praised the work of Scottish Trade International and wanted to build on the work that it has done. That is a reasonable proposition; the figure that the hon. Gentleman put on it was relatively modest and we are already looking at how that body's work can be expanded. Then along came the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, declaiming against the work in hand and denouncing the lack of a coherent Government strategy to promote Scottish businesses abroad. That is just untrue, and it is incompatible with what the hon. Member for North Tayside said. There is a strategy, and a first-class organisation. Excellent work is being done and gaining tremendous successes. I am happy to discuss with anyone how to do it a little better and to listen to ideas about how we can do it a little differently. That is what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan was presumably speaking in his party's name when he said that there is no clear promotional strategy for food.

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. McFall.</i>]</p>
	<p>1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to raise this subject at today's Scottish Grand Committee, because it is an issue that is concentrating the minds of many of my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just over a year ago this month, my constituency suffered 48 hours of torrential rain, as a result of which 500 people were left homeless and hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage was done to the local infrastructure and many local businesses. Some of those businesses were decanted from their properties for many months; indeed, some have only recently moved back in. Other firms, including horticulture businesses, lost everything. Many will never recover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the interest that the Scottish Office took at the time and the early visit to my constituency of the Minister for Education and Industry. The Bellwin formula was triggered, which was urgently required. It is also right that I should pay tribute to the work of the statutory and voluntary organisations in the area, to the spirit of my constituents, who came through a very difficult time, and to all who contributed in any way to the work of our relief fund, which raised £250,000 in donations. That is the background to today's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a long-term strategy for flood prevention schemes. There is a certain irony in the fact that Moray was flooded almost on the same day as local authorities took over responsibility for flood prevention schemes. The local council is therefore the first to have to deal with the new legal requirements. Many other councils will be watching with interest to see how Moray performs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are very concerned. Once they recovered from the initial shock, they wanted to see in place mechanisms to prevent any repetition of the devastation—both personal and physical—of last year. In the time allocated to me, I want to explore how we can develop a flood prevention scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, Moray council commissioned an extensive hydrological report, which is now available. It is a substantive, technical document on which all the schemes will have to be based. The indicative draft cost, based on intensive examination and analysis of the report by professionals, suggests that it will cost £8.75 million to meet all the recommendations. That is a substantial sum for a council the size of Moray's. There is further concern about the time scale, to which I turn now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the legislation, it appears that a council must spend the first year doing preliminary and preparatory work on the design of the permanent schemes that are required. That will mean Moray council spending £1 million from its capital budget, which of course has implications for other items that must be from that budget. One councillor said recently that the devastation of last year had seen the end of many dreams of developing capital projects in our area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Scottish Office may meet up to 50 per cent. of the costs in the preparatory year, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
some money can be released only after six months' work has been completed. Is there any possibility of advancing that six-month deadline to assist the council's work? For example, based on the analysis of the report, the council must employ additional, highly skilled engineers to develop the project. The release of some funds by the Scottish Office at an early stage would be helpful. It could be done through mutual cooperation between Moray council and the Scottish office. I am sure that both parties would take a sensible and consensual approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Procedures need to be accelerated so that the work can go ahead. The council has already undertaken work which will eventually fit into the permanent scheme and reassure people that work is being done. But people still feel that there is an unnecessary delay; and in spite of its best efforts, the council can do only a limited amount of work with the money available. We should consider the possibility of allowing Moray additional capital for procedures to develop the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme contains a legal requirement to lay a flood prevention order. Moray council must submit all the designs for approval to the Scottish Office before the order can be laid; that is, assuming that the Scottish Office gives its consent. Once the order is laid there will be a compulsory period of consultation with those whose land may be affected by the scheme. At that stage, the issue will arise of compensation to farmers and land owners whose land may be affected, and some land may be subject to a buy-out. Can some of the discussions take place earlier, when the plans come before us, rather than waiting for a long, statutory period? It would be better if matters proceeded faster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council and the authorities must observe a link with the other statutory groups involved. For example, the North of Scotland Water Authority, although I cannot call it a statutory body, has already been active because much of its work concerns sewerage. It has completed work at Kinloss and the contract has been issued for a new sewer at Ashgrove and Elgin. People in Elgin suffered devastation to their houses and they were also confronted by raw sewage. We can only imagine the horror of such a situation and I am glad that the scheme for that area will be completed by the autumn, along with the additional work at Moycroft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is design work to replace existing sewers in Pilmuir road and Forres, and other work in hand in Buckie, Lossiemouth and Rothes. But the discussions take time; the officials have to go to meetings with NOSWA and try to ensure that they get the best value for money. A lot of money is spent on those meetings and discussions because we must ensure that NOSWA's work will slot in correctly with the completed schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency must be consulted. Can the Scottish Office put pressure on that organisation? It has responsibility for flood warning systems—I understand that the technical term is telemetric stations, a new phrase that I learnt in my discussions on this complex issue—especially on the River Lossie and Mosset burn. I hope that pressure can be brought on SEPA to carry out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have shown an interest in the matter and, with the permission of the Chair, the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) wants to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1003">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

make a short contribution. As he knows, I supported his predecessor's private Member's Bill which was introduced after the floods in Elgin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come to the Committee not with a rant, to demand money now, but to ask that the Scottish Office ensures that the necessary work is undertaken in Moray as speedily as possible. I cannot speak strongly enough about the number of letters I receive, especially from the elderly, and from action groups and community councils. Every time there is a severe shower of rain they think that the problems will return. We have not experienced drought this summer and the fears of many people could best be allayed by an acceleration of the processes that are involved. With good will and commitment from the Minister, some of the problems could be addressed very quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, I share the hon. Lady's sympathy for her constituents in Moray, who have experienced difficulties. However, flooding is a difficulty that is faced throughout the country and particularly in my constituency. Renfrewshire councillors in my constituency will shortly put proposals to the Minister for two flood prevention orders—one in Paisley and one in Johnstone—in recognition of the continuing difficulties in both communities. I hope that the Minister will give the orders a sympathetic hearing in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief—my comments could have been made in an intervention. I endorse some of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Moray, particularly those about the psychological impact that flooding has on individuals in areas where it has become, if not an annual event, at least one that occurs often enough to cause concern. I have reason to know that because I represent an area that is subject to regular flooding. I can testify to the truth of what my hon. Friend said about the impact of flooding. All one needs is one day's heavy rain for the phone calls to begin and for there to be panic and concern. Last winter, we had a fairly easy time of it, at least in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister deals with the big issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) mentioned—the massive flood prevention schemes, of which one is on the go in my constituency—I hope that he will also deal with the much smaller rural schemes, of which there are also a number in my constituency. I understand that they are still being delayed by a lack of money. I know that lack of money is often used as an excuse, and we hear it fairly often. Given the
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
psychological impact of past flooding and fear for the future, however, it will be of great concern if even the small rural concerns are held up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Moray on securing the Adjournment debate today, and I thank her for the manner in which she presented her case. I also thank the other hon. Members for their contributions. I shall try to answer some of the specific points that were raised, but I should first provide the assurance that the Government take flood prevention seriously. We fully appreciate the distress that flooding can cause and the damage that it can do to people's homes and businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several towns and villages in north-east Scotland, Elgin in particular, were unexpectedly affected by flooding almost exactly a year ago. Before then, as recently as 1994 and 1995, Perth, Paisley, Kirkintilloch and other areas had been severely affected as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to be able to meet members of East Dunbartonshire council in April to discuss several matters, including flood prevention in Kirkintilloch. Before that, Ministers had met with members of Moray council in the aftermath of the 1997 flood, and with members of Renfrewshire council, to discuss the proposed prevention schemes there. We look forward to receiving formal proposals for flood prevention measures for all the most affected areas. I was happy to hear that a scheme was about to be proposed to the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably true that the general public does not view flooding as a priority for central Government or local government—that is, until it affects particular areas and people directly. It can then have a devastating impact on local communities, which can bring about a marked change in perceptions. Local authorities have a crucial role to play in seeking to prevent or mitigate flooding in Scotland. Councils' responsibilities on flooding were extended by legislative changes in 1997. The previous Government brought in the Flood Prevention and Land Drainage (Scotland) Bill, which was warmly welcomed in principle and benefited from cross-party support. The Bill was given Royal Assent just before the election, and we have taken it through to implementation. Indeed, one of the early duties performed by my colleague Lord Sewel was to sign the commencement order that brought the legislation into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among other things, the new Act translates into duties some of the permissive powers that councils had under the previous legislation. Councils are now required to take certain measures. For example, they must assess water courses in their area to find out whether they are likely to cause flooding of nonagricultural land. They must maintain water courses that appear to be likely to cause such flooding. They must also prepare and publish reports on the measures that they have taken and should take to prevent or mitigate flooding. The reports should specify all occurrences of flooding on non-agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to provide communities with total protection from flooding. It is perhaps worth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
remembering that the primary responsibility for the protection of land and of property from natural hazards such as flooding lies with the owner. That said, the new duties should help to reduce the number of flooding events and the suffering that they cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that in November last year, councils were required to produce their first reports about flooding in their areas. I am pleased to say that a good number of very useful reports were prepared. In the main, councils have clearly taken their new duties very seriously and are seeking to provide solutions to difficult problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to some of the specific examples raised. The hon. Member for Moray referred to the report produced by Moray council. I was pleased to hear that Moray council has taken a partnership approach to flooding problems, which has involved the Grampian emergency planning unit in a co-ordinating role. I understand that an emergency flood warning and response plan has been prepared in conjunction with Grampian police, the fire brigade, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the North of Scotland Water Authority. That can only be good news for the local communities that might be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that Moray council has set up a flood prevention working party that will consider all the council's responsibilities and will plan to prepare strategies for prevention, monitoring and development control. Again, that must be the right way to take matters forward. Indeed, I have been told that the council has appointed consultants to progress the work needed in the four areas most affected by last July's floods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Development control has important implications. National planning policy guideline no. 7 covers planning and flooding. Its purpose is to ensure that flood risk is taken into account in the planning of all developments and that measures are taken to reduce that risk. I am aware that Moray council's flood report fully recognises that requirement and that developers are now being asked to undertake hydrological studies as part of the planning process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main power granted by flood prevention legislation is for councils to promote flood prevention schemes of the sort that the hon. Member for Moray described. The cost of such schemes has major implications for councils' spending plans. I understand that the figures given by the hon. lady are correct, and that in the case of Moray council, expenditure of up to £9 million could be involved. Clearly, the council's present capital allocation would mean that it would be unable to meet such a large single commitment without significant pressure on other priority areas in council spending. That general issue may affect other councils, and it is being considered in the comprehensive spending review, in discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I cannot pre-empt the findings of that review, but I am pleased to say that, in the near future, I hope to be able to advise some councils of extra resources for planned flood prevention measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, the fact remains that spending priorities in capital programmes are a matter for the councils concerned. However, if a scheme has
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
progressed and has been confirmed by the Secretary of State, Government grant is provided at a rate of 50 per cent. of eligible expenditure. That grant can include the costs of consultants' preliminary studies and design costs as well as construction costs. As the hon. Lady said, the statutory process between identification of the need for a scheme and its construction can take a considerable amount of time. Scottish Office officials encourage councils and their consultants to discuss their proposals at as early a stage as possible, because they must be acceptable to the Secretary of State. I therefore invite the hon. Member for Moray to remind Moray council of that in her forthcoming discussions. I am sure that a number of schemes will result from that process. I shall return later to a couple of the hon. Lady's other questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the matters that were raised by the hon. Members for Perth and for Paisley, South. The Perth scheme, at approximately £25 million, with funding already in place, is the biggest of its type in Scotland. The Scottish office is awaiting details of the council's design costs for consideration of grant. I am also aware that Renfrewshire council has identified flood prevention as one of its key priorities; and that a scheme for Paisley is under consideration and is shortly to be submitted to me. In fact, I approved an additional capital allocation of £1 million in January of this year to allow Renfrewshire council to proceed immediately with flood prevention works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1997 Act does not change the power to make flood prevention schemes, but it does encourage councils to focus on areas of flood risk and to identify what needs to be done. That should ensure that the resources that are available for flood prevention measures are used in a planned manner and to the best effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray asked about the six-month period. There is no time scale laid down in the legislation, but statutory schemes must follow a sequence of proper procedures. Grant is only available when the scheme has progressed to the appropriate stage. However, I could consider making an allocation available once preliminary work has started. As I have said, design fees are also eligible for grant. I would welcome early discussions with Moray council once it has decided which option to take forward. Land compensation costs could also be included in the overall package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady, and other hon. Members, will acknowledge that the Government have responded quickly and positively to flooding problems. I assure her that we shall continue to do so. I hope that she will also acknowledge that the duties and powers in the legislation are sufficient to allow councils to act to help prevent flooding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
