	<div class='title'>Draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1997</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Sir John Wheeler)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1997.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland Consequential Amendments) Order 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Copies of the orders were laid before the House on 20 November 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order is a substantial and wide-ranging measure that will update the criminal law in Northern Ireland in several important and diverse areas. It will implement proposals flowing from the 1993 discussion paper "Crime and the Community", and introduce a series of other provisions that will bring the law in Northern Ireland broadly into line with more recent changes in England and Wales. For ease of reference by practitioners and courts, the order will also restate existing legislation on deferment of sentence, probation, conditional and absolute discharge and community service orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be more helpful if I concentrate my remarks on those areas of greatest significance. I will, of course, assist the Committee with any other points that hon. Members may raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of a new statutory sentencing framework for financial, community and custodial punishments must be regarded as being of particular importance. While the Criminal Justice Act 1991 established such a framework in England and Wales, sentencers in Northern Ireland continue to rely on guidance from the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. The new framework will, quite rightly, emphasise the seriousness of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enhanced range of community penalties will offer the courts a more varied but no less challenging range of options for dealing with offenders within the community. Before imposing a community or custodial sentence, the court must consider the seriousness of the offence, or the combination of the offence and one or more associated offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, before deciding whether to impose a custodial sentence for a violent or sexual offence, a court must consider the need to protect the public from serious harm from the offender. The new framework will help to ensure fairness, consistency and clarity in sentencing decisions in the Northern Ireland courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In Northern Ireland, unlike England and Wales, there is at present no general system of post-release supervision of offenders. I turn briefly to two changes that the draft order will make in this area. First, a new sentence will be introduced for offences that are serious enough to merit imprisonment for one year or more. In those circumstances, the custody probation order will, with the consent of the offender, involve a period of custody followed by a period of supervision under probation of between one and three years. Secondly—I know that this will be particularly welcomed in Northern Ireland—the courts will be given the option of being able to require those convicted of sexual offences to be supervised on licence from the date of their release from prison until the expiry of the pronounced sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most grateful to all those who responded to the consultation process on the draft order. After full consideration of all the points raised, I decided to make a small number of additions and minor changes to the published draft, and it would be appropriate to draw those to the attention of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order now contains three new provisions that will bring Northern Ireland further into line with Great Britain in matters relating to knives and other dangerous weapons. They will prohibit the sale of knives to children under the age of 16—I am particularly grateful to the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) for his views on the issue—and ban the manufacture and sale of flick and gravity knives. They will also make arrestable the offence of carrying an article with a blade or point on school premises. I have also made a small number of amendments to the published draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that pre-sentence reports are sought and obtained when necessary, I have decided that a court should give reasons why it is of the opinion that a pre-sentence report is not required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In schedule 1 to the draft order, which provides for additional requirements for probation orders, I have removed the provision which disapplies the normal 60-day limit in relation to activities and attendance at a day centre where an offender has been convicted of a sexual offence. I am satisfied that the other additional requirements will provide the courts with an adequate range of options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those who responded during consultation were concerned about what would happen if an offender breached the probation element of a custody probation order. In such circumstances, the court would be able to revoke the order and deal with the offender as if he had just been convicted of the original offence. As the offender will have already served part of his sentence in custody, I agree that that would be unduly harsh. I have therefore amended the provisions to ensure that in cases of breach the court will be able to take into account the extent to which the sentence has already been satisfied by the time spent in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the release of sex offenders on licence, concern was expressed about the extent of the powers given to the Secretary of State to revoke licences and recall offenders without recourse to any judicial process. I fully understand that concern and now
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
intend therefore that failure to comply with the conditions of a licence will be dealt with by the courts, which may impose a fine of £1,000 or suspend the licence and return the offender to prison for up to six months. Should the offender be convicted of a further offence during the licence period, the court will be able to return him to prison for all or part of that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order as published did not apply the provisions on fines and financial circumstances to those aged under 17. The original intention had been to extend those provisions in forthcoming juvenile justice legislation, but on reflection I feel that it would be more logical for the draft order to include all age groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of consequential amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 1991 extend to the whole of the United Kingdom, and it is therefore necessary, by virtue of section 38(2) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, to include them in the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland Consequential Amendments) Order 1997 which was laid with the main order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I believe that the orders contain a balanced package of measures which will make a welcome contribution towards enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the criminal justice system in Northen Ireland. I commend them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.39 pm
Mr. Tony Worthington (Clydebank and Milngavie): It is some time since I took up my post and I am still appalled by the way in which we deal with legislation such as this. We are dealing with a measure containing 58 articles in under three hours. The sooner that we rectify that the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make introductory remarks on the draft order and raise specific points. I shall trust you, Sir Giles, to spot me later to allow me to make other points rather than mention them all as one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We broadly welcome the measure which, as the Minister said, came about as a response to the 1993 consultation paper "Crime and the Community". There has been sensible alignment where that is appropriate, but I must say—I hope that this does not damage the Minister's career too much—that there are welcome signs that the Northern Ireland Office is allergic to the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order adds to the range of the courts' responses and we particularly welcome the intention to provide more information on the working of the criminal justice system, to which I shall return. We also welcome the introduction of an array of community-based measures and of measures to take ability to pay into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final remarks in the Minister's introductory statement concerned the amendments to the proposal for a draft order. We welcome the initiative taken by the hon. and learned Member for North Down to prohibit the sale of knives to children under 16. We also welcome proposals to ban the manufacture and
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
sale of flick and gravity knives and to make arrestable the offence of carrying an article with a blade or point on school premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, however, knives legislation currently has a high profile in the United Kingdom. That means that the Minister's proposals to bring Northern Ireland legislation into line will soon be out of date because legislation in Great Britain is likely to change. What action will the Secretary of State take to ensure that Northern Ireland enjoys the same protection as elsewhere with regard to the sale and use of knives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been reported that streets and town centres will be designated as search centres under new laws to curb combat knives. The Home Office has said that the Government were considering handing the police powers to carry out virtually random searches in given trouble spots for a temporary period. How will the Minister and the Northern Ireland Office respond to those reported Home Office initiatives? At present, officers must have reasonable grounds to suspect that someone is carrying a knife before searching him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government has announced new curbs on knives after consultation with the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats. New laws are to be introduced to ban the packaging of knives as weapons and adverts that suggest that knives can be used for fighting. The Government now seem to accept that it is possible to control the sale and marketing of combat knives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will be aware of a private Member's Bill that is to come before the House on Friday. It is promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray), and the Opposition are confident that it will receive a Second Reading. The Bill would ban the sale of combat knives and introduce associated powers. Such proposals have been around since 1993. What action will the Government take—perhaps in the form of an Order in Council—speedily to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland have the same protection as elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to combat knives on a number of occasions. What is the Labour party's definition of a combat knife?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear Conservative Members saying "Wait for Friday", but we do not need to wait until then. My hon. Friend the Member for Provan has published the Bill. I Do not have a copy with me, but if the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) wants to read it, he will find that the Home Secretary has agreed that it is possible to have a legally satisfactory definition of combat knives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says sotto voce that I do not know. Leaving aside more specific definitions, however, we must always consider the test—which appears in some Government legislation—of what a reasonable person would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
interpret to be a combat knife. I know one when I see one and any reasonable person—the great majority of people—would recognise one, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Winnick 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Walsall, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that attempts have always been made—certainly by the Government—to refuse to consider legislation on the basis that one cannot define a combat knife? It is interesting that the Government have now changed their view because of increasing public concern, not least because of the knifing to death of the headmaster Philip Lawrence. We should all be pleased that a definition has been accepted by the Home Office—my hon. Friend is perfectly right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, As my hon. Friend knows, the Labour party has been circulating a petition to ban the sale of combat knives. I have been taking part in the gathering of names for it, and no one from whom I sought support for our measure to ban combat knives raised the issue of a definition—they knew what we were talking about as well. However, I did not stumble across the hon. Member for East Londonderry when I was seeking signatures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise one other point, which in some respects is similar to what I said about knives. We welcome the change that has been put forward by the Government to moderate the powers of the Secretary of State with regard to the revoking of a licence for a sex offender. Article 2 states that sexual offence
	<br><blockquote><p>"has the same meaning as in section 58(5) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968"</p></blockquote>
that is, sexual offence is defined in the order as it is in that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have now introduced the Protection from Harrassment Bill, which we know as the anti-stalking Bill. It would be interesting to know whether the offence of harassment has been caught up by the definition in that rather old 1968 Act. I regard the stalking cases that have been reported as sexual offences because the person who perpetrates the stalking puts the victim under a sexual threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have little doubt that such harassment would be interpreted as a sexual threat, but if someone was in prison for that offence, would it be caught up by the order? To some extent, the question is academic at the moment, because the anti-stalking measure is not a Northern Ireland Bill, but covers the rest of the United Kingdom. The Government have, however, introduced a consultation paper on the issue of harassment, so they probably intend to extend the anti-stalking provision to Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only this morning in the final session of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill the Minister again refused to make stalking a specific offence in Scottish law, claiming that breach of the peace legislation was sufficient to deal with it. I hope that there is no such nonsense in the case of Northern Ireland and that there will be a specific offence of stalking, for which the courts can deliver an appropriate sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman responds to that reasonable intervention, I hope he will understand that it is outwith the competence of both the orders that the Committee is discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Sir Giles, I want the Minister to say whether the proposed crime of stalking or harassment would be swept up by section 58(5) of the 1968 Act, which the order refers to as the source of definitions for sexual offences. The issue is complicated, but I hope that the Minister will now answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government have introduced an anti-harassment or anti-stalking consultation paper for Northern Ireland I hope that we shall not have to wait as long for legislative action as we have for this order. The consultation paper "Crime and the Community" was produced in 1993 and we are acting upon it now at the tail end of 1996. If the Government move with the same speed, action will not be taken until 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to elide one piece of legislation with another. I remind him, however, that the issue that he raised is not specific to the order before us. He has made his point, but he should now move on to a more relevant topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your guidance, Sir Giles, and I shall simply pledge that when the Labour party comes to power, it will not wait until 1999 to provide the women of Northern Ireland with the protection that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on this introductory section, I should like to ask the Minister to explain proposed changes in the application of financial provisions to those aged under 17. Rather than anticipate juvenile justice legislation in the future, the Minister said that he would act now to apply certain financial provisions to under-17s. However, I do not understand that because I do not know what resources people under 17 are supposed to have. If I have understood the provisions correctly, the ability to pay is to be taken into account when administering fines. I am at a loss to understand what income can be taken into account in dealing with under-17s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complex piece of legislation, as the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) has rightly said. In general, the order is welcome because it brings the law of Northern Ireland broadly into line with the law in Great Britain. However, reading the preamble makes it clear that it deals with matters that were also delat with in 1991, 1993, 1994 and as far back as 1964. There may be good reasons why the previous legislation was considered sufficient to deal with the evils that the order seeks to redress. However, if changes had to be made in Great Britain, we should be considering Northern Ireland legislation with a more critical eye. We should also be moving faster than we are.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Given the complexity and width of items with which we are confronted, we should be tackling the legislative problems by Bill. There are many issues which hon. Members in Britain as well as in Northern Ireland would like to have examined afresh in the light of experience of legislation passed in this House for the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for Ministers to say that the order simply brings us into line. Several years have passed in which Great Britain legislation has settled down and been tested in the courts and in the community. Surely we have missed an excellent opportunity for full consideration through the proper procedure of a Bill passing through the House. Amendments could have been tabled and we could have revisited land previously trodden over in GB legislation. We might then have been able to tie the whole lot together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie continually referred to coming changes. I hope that both the Labour and Conservative parties take the view that it would be much simpler to include Northern Ireland within that legislation, avoiding the need to come back to a gathering such as this, where we can make no changes other than to vote the order down. Even if we were enough in number, no one would be inclined to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman's comments on the knives legislation. My intervention was not just mischief making—this is a serious issue. Article 53 sets out in clear, specific terms the description of a number of knives, such as flick knives or gravity knives. Despite the careful wording, this provision still seems rather general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I would recognise a combat knife if I saw one. Whether anyone in this Committee has been in armed combat with a knife, I do not know—I doubt it. If we asked members of the armed forces in this country or, indeed, in any other modern society, what knife they would use in armed combat, I suspect that they would not choose what is normally described as a combat knife, which is on sale in the shops. I have seen things there which seem to be far better equipped for cleaning up swedes, turnips and sugar beet than for combat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An enormous amount of nonsense is talked about this subject, which appeals to the macho image that some young men have of themselves. It is in that context that the danger of any sharp implement lies. There is a shop in my constituency that sells knives. The biggest element to purchase them consists of members of the armed forces, and not necessarily from Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the principle of trying to stop people buying these items and carrying them on the street. No sane person would want that. However, I run into considerable difficulty whenever I read the definitions in article 54. First, it provides that the article applies to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any knife, knife blade or razor blade".</p></blockquote>
If my 15-year-old son goes to the chemist's for razor blades, which he needs because the hair is starting to grow on his face, the chemist who sells them to him is guilty of an offence. As the law is written here, it bears no relation to the use to which the razor blades are to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
be put—it is an offence to sell them. I do not think that the Minister or the Government intend such innocent activity to be caught under the order. However, I suspect that under the letter of the law, such an activity will be caught, so the provision is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article does not say "gives" but "sells" to a person. If my son comes home and says, "Daddy, the chemist won't sell me razor blades", and I say, "Okay, son, here's one", I am not guilty of an offence, but my son has the article nevertheless. As far as I can see, the article does not even provide that it is an offence to carry razor blades down the street if I buy them from the chemist and give them to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we proceed, we need to think more carefully of the implications of the wording. What about "any axe"? There are all sorts of agricultural aids and implements. I know—I have had to use most of them for cutting hedges, and so on. There are bill hooks and various implements that go by different names in different parts of the country. They would all be very serious weapons if people wanted to use them as such. If someone went to a football match with a bill hook over his shoulder, the police would, quite properly, take a very dim view of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should it be an offence if I send my son to the local shop, which sells farm potatoes, to buy a billhook or an axe because the old one has worn out? It would be an offence for a 15-year-old boy to buy it and carry it home. Surely that is not the Government's intention with the legislation, which includes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed and which is made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person".</p></blockquote>
That is a huge barn door for an evil-intentioned person to get through. He could carry a screwdriver or a wood chisel. A wood chisel is not made or adapted for causing injuries to a person. However, what else would be more likely to do so? What about the Stanley knife—a perfectly legitimate piece of equipment, which any do-it-yourself addict might have. Although I am not opposed to the intention of the proposal, it is full of mines and pitfalls, which need to be explored in a different context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill of the hon. Member for Provan because it will give Members of the House the time and space to reflect on what we would like to do and how we could sensibly do it. It is not simple but extremely difficult, because there are so many perfectly legitimate uses that could be caught by the legislation as it is framed here and as it will be framed elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to delay the Committee but I should like to say to its members—and, through 
	<i>Hansard,</i> to the House in general—that we need to think through the issue and find definitions that work. Even if we defined the length of a knife blade, some people consistently and legitimately use knives with a longer blade than the normal pocket knife. Farmers and gardeners have legitimate uses for some types of knives. They carry them and they use them. The place to where they are carried and the use to which they are put—the whole context in which the article exists—are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
in question. That involves subjective judgments, which are a dangerous minefield for any court or legislative process to enter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I said at the beginning that the legislation met with general favour in Northern Ireland, I was not originally expected to be the hon. Member with the job of speaking to the legislation in the House. The Minister must understand, therefore, that I have made a less detailed examination of it than I should normally give to similar legislation. However, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland considers that although
	<br><blockquote><p>"the wording of section 10.1(b) is exactly the same as that used in England and Wales … such a statement places responsibilities on the Probation Service which it is not equipped or designed to deliver".</p></blockquote>
The PBNI believes that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is important that the nature of the Probation Service's role is understood by Government, by Courts and the public, otherwise unreal expectations of its ability to be a public protection agency will be placed on Probation Officers in a way which will do neither the Service nor the public any good."</p></blockquote>
That is a serious statement for the PBNI to make. The Minister must tell us whether its assessment that unreal expectations are raised by the legislation is correct. There is nothing worse than legislation that raises expectations that cannot be met. I consider that a serious matter, and I hope that the Minister can allay fears that the legislation might raise false expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PBNI also points out that some people will come under a combined probation and community service order which
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be used inappropriately by courts especially with offenders whose lifestyle is so undisciplined and chaotic that by imposing a double requirement we set them up to fail."</p></blockquote>
I want the legislation to work in spirit as well as to the letter. If there is a problem, I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government have taken sufficient steps to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of sex offenders is a vast theme. I welcome the steps taken to deal with it, but it should be dealt with on a United Kingdom basis by a Bill. We should have the same laws and measures throughout the kingdom. Sex offending requires more examination that it has hitherto received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether people are more willing to report sex offences, or whether they are more willing to accept the nasty publicity that sometimes follows allegations of sexual offences, or whether this is a new phenomenon and there is a real rise in the number indulging in that type of behaviour—these are matters for argument. Personally, I think that there is rather more of it now and that more people are prepared to complain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that everyone in Northern Ireland will welcome the provision that a court can decide whether sex offenders are to be supervised on release from prison. Indeed, most people in Northern Ireland will say that it does not go far enough and that all sex offenders should be supervised when they are released from prison. We have had a constant stream of the most horrific cases of crimes committed by sex offenders after they have served their sentences. The Minister will know the number of cases in Northern
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Ireland where sex offenders, especially those who abused children, have been harried out of their homes on housing estates once people discovered that they had such a record. We also know the sort of treatment that such people receive from other prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is difficult and serious. I hope that the steps we are taking today are only the beginning of a careful and detailed examination of it, not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom. I wholly agree with the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie about what has to be done in respect of the harassment of women by, for example, stalkers. I hope that Northern Ireland will be included in the Bill dealing with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final matter that I wish to touch upon is how we deal with fine defaulters. The reality is that the prisons are full of young people who do not have much money and who are prepared to spend a week or 10 days in prison rather than pay a large fine. If the Minister ask his officials to dig out the number of people who fall into that category each year, he will be quite astonished. The public cost must be immense. Instead of such people going to prison, we should be making darned sure that we recover the fine by some means or other and not increase the cost to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mean not that we should give fine defaulters 10 hours community service but that we should deduct the money from their income, whether that be wages or social security payments. Make them pay! Even if it works out to be even steven—to cost as much to get the money from them as we receive back—it is a sight cheaper than putting them in prison and keeping them there for three or four days. If they choose their time properly, they are in Wednesday and out on Friday. Let us apply a little common sense to the legislation and recover the fine. Let them be brought to book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman also accept that some people might not have paid fines imposed for not buying a television licence because they are living in too great poverty already? They would either have had to pay the fine or buy their children food. The Government have cut benefits to single parents, which makes it even harder for them to cope with their financial responsibilities. In those cases there should be alternative punishments to forcing yet more money out of people who can ill afford it, or to sending people to prision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Lady's comments—we frequently hear that argument in the House. However, I am not suggesting that those people should pay the fine in one fell swoop—they could pay 50p a Week—but they must pay it. We should not allow people to escape punishment for crimes—doing so would only encourage them to commit more crimes. People must understand that there are rules in society that have to be obeyed and that, if they fail to do so, they will incur financial penalties. Prison, and all its associated effects, should be reserved for the more serious crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to delay the Committee any longer than is necessary—I shall not revisit ground that we have already gone over—so I shall simply repeat my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
request that such legislation should proceed by means of Bills. Northern Ireland should be included in any new legislation in this general field. I hope that the Government will carefully consider their forthcoming legislation on knives. They should deal with the problem; they should not react—as they often do—to an emotional cry from the streets or to the mounting public pressure that the media are relaying to us. There is a problem out there, but whether the reaction that we have heard is the right way to proceed is not yet clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that any member of the Committee or of the House—including my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office—is comfortable with the way that we legislate for Northern Ireland. The order contains 58 articles and seven schedules. If the order's provisions had been in a Bill introduced by the Home Office, a substantial criminal justice Bill would result; it would receive a Second Reading on the Floor of the House—that debate would last a full day—a full Standing Committee stage, a Report stage and all the rest of it. However, members of the Committee have been asked to consider the order in less than three hours, which is not enough to do justice to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mean to criticise my right hon. Friend—I have simply described the way the system works. Three years passed between the publication of the discussion document and the date when the order came before the House. If my right hon. Friend had waited for a prime legislative slot there could have been considerable further delays. I appreciate, however, the reason behind the current process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion—when we are considering a major piece of legislation that is subject to the Order-in-Council procedure—it is important to place on record the fact that we are unhappy about the process. Members of Parliament with constituencies in Northern Ireland should be fully involved in the consideration of legislation that is principally for the people and the elected representatives of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given some thought to what we could do about the matter. The Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs is pretty new and is still feeling its way, but one possible way forward would be to involve that Committee when a draft order is published—the order before us was published in May—and to take evidence on it. That Committee could get hold of copies of the representations that might be made in response to consultations and publish a report on the legislation, with a view to making recommendations to the Government. That is one way to involve people in a more public forum before we reach the legislative stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to go through the order line by line. I have one question for my right hon. Friend, which is about the drugs problem in Northern Ireland. As he knows—recently, he kindly gave evidence to the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs on that matter—we have examined the drugs problem in
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Northern Ireland and next month we intend to publish a report, which I hope will be constructive. Does my right hon. Friend think that the order will be relevant to drugs offences? Is he satisfied that the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland has available to it all the penalties that are needed to tackle effectively that growing problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I was not in the House yesterday because I was involved with the Scottish Grand Committee. I received the card requesting my attendance at this Committee in my mail only this morning. When I went to the Vote Office to ask for the relevant papers, I received this slim document entitled Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland Consequential Amendments) Order 1997. It was only on my arrival at the Committee that the hon. Member for East Londonderry showed me that there were indeed about 50 clauses and various schedules in the order. I regard this as a wholly stupid and unnecessary way in which to conduct affairs. There is no time to wade one's way through all the documents. It is completely unreasonable for the people of Northern Ireland to have their legislation conducted in such a fashion. I therefore fully support the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.16 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a particular pleasure and opportune moment for me to respond to the points raised in the debate this afternoon—the more so under this magnificent oil painting depicting Alfred inciting the Saxons to prevent the landing of the Danes. Alfred, as the Committee will observe, is in possession of a distinctly offensive weapon, which might qualify under the definition. I also see an axe depicted in the painting. It seems appropriate that we should be having this debate under these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I do not see in the painting, however—because they did not exist then—are the baseball bat or the cudgel studded with nails, which are the principal offensive weapons in Northern Ireland. They have been used with such cruelty and devastating effect on well over 500 occasions on individuals—boys, young men, sometimes women—in what are called punishment beatings. We do not suffer from the scourge of knife crime, which is familiar to urban England, in quite the same way, but we do have other forms of crime with which the law seeks to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, who was supported by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), who asked why we should not proceed with a Bill, rather than an order. That was a theme of discussion in the Committee. Many of the proposals in "Crime and the Community"—the document that we published in Northern Ireland for wide consultation—are based on the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The timing of the order, which the Committee is considering today, has enabled the Government to take into account the provisions of the 1991 Act and, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
particular, to reflect upon the amendments to the 1991 Act, as made by the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, as well as some freestanding provisions. There has been an advantage in taking our time before producing this order for the Committee's consideration this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept the argument as to why we should have a Bill, as opposed to an order, with such a large number of clauses. I must prevail upon my hon. Friend the Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household to use his influence in places where such matters are discussed to ensure that the House has shorter recesses and longer Second Reading debates and Standing Committee scrutiny. I am sure that that would be a popular move, which my hon. Friend can use in his arguments with other business channels about the amount of time the House has to consider such important matters. I stand ready to be at my place on such an occasion: to go through the Bill, clause by clause, should that be a possibility in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield also asked whether the Government were satisfied that they had in their armoury in the proposed order all the necessary penalties to deal with the menace of drugs. I particularly look forward to considering the Select Committee report on this, when it is published in the near future. I shall welcome its recommendations and consider them very seriously indeed, for, as my hon. Friend knows, I take particular and detailed interest in the drugs problem; a special committee in Northern Ireland exists to bring all the Departments together to seek to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The short answer to my hon. Friend's question is yes, I believe it does. However, I have said publicly in Northern Ireland that if we find that our legislation is inadequate to deal with the particular circumstances that we face there, I shall not hesitate to bring forward a measure for the House or the Committee to consider on a future occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friend of a particularly important order that we agreed earlier in the year. It enables the confiscation of assets from the proceeds of crime, which is far more relevant for dealing with drug traffickers who make their money out of crime in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. It is a powerful measure which I hope my hon. Friend agrees is one of the most significant ways in which to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie who, as always, asked some important questions. I welcome his general support for the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall resist involving myself in too deep a discussion about knives and their definitions; it is a complicated area. Consideration is still being given to the content of the new Home Office legislation. When it has been finalised, we in Northern Ireland will give urgent consideration to how corresponding protection might best be provided in Northern Ireland. Much of the existing legislation in that area already extends to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Northern Ireland and I assure the Committee that I am by no means reluctant or hesitant to follow legislation in England and Wales or Great Britain where it adds to or sustains our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for East Londonderry will agree that Northern Ireland is sometimes well placed—the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie hinted at this in his opening remarks—to be able to hold back and see how things turn out in practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom before it leaps into following suit with identical legislation. With that caveat, I can assure the Committee that we shall consider the matter carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the term "sexual offence" incorporated harassment, and I know that other members of the Committee are interested in that issue, too. The definition of sexual offence does not include harassment in the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968, and elsewhere it is not proposed to designate either of the new offences in the harassment legislation as sexual offences in the manner that was suggested. Not all instances of stalking are sexual in nature. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has asked our right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary to include a provision in the Bill that would enable corresponding measures to be introduced quickly in Northern Ireland by Order in Council subject to the negative resolution procedure. I hope that that helps the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to fines on people aged 17 years or under.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is so important that Northern Ireland has the same or similar legislation, why do we not just add a clause which says that a Bill or certain sections of it extend to Northern Ireland? That would get rid of the problem in the first instance, and we could all come and talk about it and examine it in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to shorter recesses and longer discussion days. It is now the habit to denigrate long discussions, but I remember long discussions and filibustering leading to considerable improvements in Bills. The concept of long periods of debate and of having ample opportunity to table and discuss amendments in detail is well founded because it allows us to tease out problems and make improvements. Every Government should follow that general principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Detailed discussion of complicated matters is always valuable. Other opportunities for discussion have, however, arisen in the House over the years as a result of procedural changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of the Northern Ireland Select Committee gives a group of hon. Members the opportunity to put issues of particular importance and public concern under the spotlight. As a former member of a Select Committee, I welcome that. We now also have the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, which is still in its early days. I hope that it, too, will provide us with an opportunity to consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
some policy issues in greater detail. Apart from the usual legislative means, the House has agreed to additional means to enable Members of Parliament to be more involved in and informed about issues. I broadly agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are differences in criminal and civil law as regards stalking and harassment. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion of a direct extension to Northern Ireland is, therefore, not possible. I must emphasise again that Northern Ireland has a distinct body of law. We have yet to determine the method of governance in Northern Ireland and do not know whether we shall need to keep its body of law alive and well or whether it will be simply another part of the United Kingdom with the same law—such as Kent, Surrey or Yorkshire. That political question has not yet been resolved and it is my duty as the custodian of Northern Ireland's separate criminal justice system to preserve it until politics determine otherwise. That is why it is not always possible simply to apply Home Office measures to Northern Ireland. In any case, it is sometimes an advantage to stand back and see whether such measures work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that fines that are imposed on 17-year-olds and younger people will require the court to inquire into the parents' financial circumstances. The Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 states that a parent or guardian may be responsible for the payment of a fine. The financial penalties provisions in the draft order should allow an inquiry into financial circumstances to be made against the parent or guardian. A person of 17 years or under may be employed, so the measure is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to consider the points raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, who, as usual, brought much wisdom to our consideration. We have already discussed the use of Bills and I have explained why it is sometimes appropriate to use an order and not always possible to use legislation. I am all for using the Bill procedure whenever possible, providing that the business managers and my hon. Friend the Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household can prevail on the circles in which they mysteriously move to find the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protection of the public is an important element in many of the disposals available to the courts in Northern Ireland. In the context of supervision by a probation officer, that protection arises through the prevention or discouragement of reoffending. Although the form of words used is the same as that used in England and Wales, it does not change the role of the probation officer in Northern Ireland and certainly should not be interpreted as creating a responsibility akin to that of a police officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised further points about knives. The provisions reflect legislation that was fully debated before being introduced for England and Wales. It would be illogical to have different definitions in Northern Ireland, therefore the order seeks to follow the definitions to which the House has already given a great deal of time and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The hon. Gentleman also asked if the Probation Board would be equipped to carry out its additional responsibilities. It will be necessary to allow the board in Northern Ireland time to recruit and train the small—I stress the word "small"—number of additional staff who will be required to prepare pre-sentence reports, supervise offenders and carry out other responsibilities that are provided for in the order. On the basis of anticipated resources, it is expected that the provisions will commence next autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then raised the important point about the use of prison resources. He said that prisons are becoming fuller. They may be becoming fuller in England and Wales, where different considerations apply, but I am happy to tell the Committee that in Northern Ireland the prisons are emptying. Their population is down from about 1,900 to about 1,600. We do not suffer from the burden of having all our cells filled, but we want to use every possible means to prevent people who fail to pay fines arriving at the prison door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that more than 90 per cent. of fines imposed in Northern Ireland are collected—that is a good record. About 1,500 people are imprisoned each year for default and that figure has been declining in recent years. Of that 1,500, I can say with some confidence that many arrivals at prison reception are followed by the arrival of one of Northern Ireland's famous black taxis bearing a friend or relation, well-provided with bank notes to pay the fine, so the individuals do not stay too long as guests of Her Majesty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman made a good point. We want to explore all possible means of reducing that number, bearing in mind that the fine disposal in the courts is the most successful and cheapest of all disposals. If we in the House or the Committee damage that disposal, we may have an even bigger or more expensive problem to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that only 10 per cent. of those who are fined arrive at the prison doors, but they are usually admitted through the doors, and there are costs associated with that. Will he tell us the costs of admitting and keeping those who receive a seven-day sentence, given that they will usually serve two or three days?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are associated costs that I want to avoid. To be frank, I cannot recall them from the recesses of my mind this afternoon. They exist, I can find them and if the hon. Gentleman would like me to write to him, I will gladly do so. I want to diminish those costs, but the prison system in Northern Ireland is reducing—somewhat uniquely compared with others, I have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On fine default disposals, the legislation is intended to ensure that the court will ascertain an offender's means before deciding any fine. That should prevent the imposition of fines that are not within the offender's means, which is common sense. The Government acknowledge that the range of disposals for fine defaulters in Northern Ireland is narrower

than that available in other United Kingdom jurisdictions. We shall take a close interest in the success of the new alternatives proposed for England and Wales in the Crime (Sentences) Bill and review arrangements in Northern Ireland accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I emphasise the advantage that Northern Ireland has: it can stand back from the grand ventures of Great Britain to see whether they work. If they are effective, we can contemplate bringing them into our jurisdiction if they would make a contribution. I am glad to assure the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I reaffirm what I said earlier: the draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 and the associated order will make important contributions to enhancing the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly follow up what the Minister said about my initial point? With regard to the anti-harassment Bill, I welcome his assurance that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has been in touch with the Home Office to ensure that there is provision for an Order in Council in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that not all cases of harassment are sexual, but hope to help the civil servants at the Northern Ireland Office—I am being mischievous, of course—by saying that the test of the adequacy of any Order in Council will be whether people who are convicted of sexual harassment or stalking that has a sexual purpose are swept up by the measure's provisions for supervision on release. Will that be taken into account in any Order in Council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should follow up two points that were made about fines. Perhaps the Minister will clear them up. First, if the means of a juvenile's parents are taken into account when imposing a fine—for example, one of £1,000, imposed because the parents are wealthy—what is the legal situation if it is not paid? Who would go to prison for non-payment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for East Londonderry mentioned the cost of non-payment of fines. I recently asked the Minister for information about the cost with regard to Northern Ireland prisons. I can dredge nothing up—the trouble with asking such questions is that one does not always remember the answers. I think that the cost of a stay in prison in Northern Ireland—it varies from £40,000 to £60,000 a year—is considerably greater than elsewhere. Taking a middling figure—£50,000 a year—the cost is £1,000 a week per prisoner. If 1,500 people did not pay their fines and stayed in prison for an average of about a week the cost would be about £1.5 million a year—a considerable sum. Those are guesstimates, but the costs of sending someone to prison for a week for nonpayment of a small fine are substantial, so it is not a sensible option if it can be avoided. The fine may be £50, but the punishment may cost the state £1,000, so I hope that the Minister will reconsider the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I now wish to raise the points about later provisions in the order—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the Minister thought he was getting off that lightly he has another think coming. I take the Minister's point about the value of ascertaining whether provisions work in England and Wales before trying them in Northern Ireland. One updating, however, that the Minister has not achieved relates to rape, which now includes male upon male as well as male upon female rape. Why has the Minister not taken the opportunity of harmonising those provisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 deals with deferment of sentence. I acknowledge that it can be a useful power to confer on a court so that it can wait and see how an offender behaves before deciding on the sentence. Good behaviour will influence the court at a later stage. Will the Minister explain what are the powers of the Northern Ireland Office in giving guidance to the courts? I recognise the danger that many deferments may lead to unnecessary adjournments and the constant threat of harsher punishments. The power may be useful, but what guidelines will be offered to make it clear that that power should be used with discretion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 refers to conditional and absolute discharges. Frankly, I cannot understand the article's logic. The concepts of absolute and conditional discharge contain elements of confusion. What do they actually mean? In some respects, the article seeks to clear up the ambiguity. It seems to say that the conviction has force only for the purpose of being on someone's record. It is recognised that a conditional or absolute discharge means that a conviction will not debar someone from particular jobs. It is not a exclusion from such jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, is not the fact that someone is given a criminal record more of a punishment than the fine or probation that might have been awarded were it not for the conditional or absolute discharge? Some organisations have responded to the problem by saying that confusion about conditional and absolute discharges still persist in the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 deals with pre-conviction reports. I should have liked the Government to go further on that. I cannot imagine circumstances in which it could be beneficial not to have a pre-conviction report. The Government say that there should be a report on the social circumstances of an offender so that a full probation report is set in its proper context. Surely, though, it should be mandatory to have a report, particularly if one were thinking of imposing a community service order. It would be necessary for the court to know more about the person and what kind of work or activity they might be involved in if it were considering such an order. The Minister has only amended what was originally proposed to say that the court has to give reasons for not having a pre-conviction report. I do not follow that logic, and wonder why the Minister did not go further and say that there had to be such a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 10, I associate myself with the hon. Member for East Londonderry. On additional requirements to be written into an order, the probation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
service has asked for the courts to be sparing, because it gives a false impression if the probation service is given tasks that it is not equipped to carry out. In the words of the hon. Member for East Londonderry, and as the probation service said, it is not a primary public protection agency. It is not there to act like the police or some kind of detailed supervisory agency. Probation officers must not be given unrealistic jobs to carry out. Will the Government or the judiciary be issuing guidelines to the courts to ensure that there is not inappropriate adding to the work of the probation service tasks for which it is not equipped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to learning from experience in England and Wales to see whether things have worked there. There is the same point regarding articles 13 and 15. Article 13 has its roots in what the Home Office was trying to do when it said that community service orders should become more punitive than rehabilitative. I sense that there is some resistence in the Northern Ireland Office to going down that road. What has been learnt from the experience in England and Wales about the combination of probation and community service orders? When the Home Secretary was proposing to change the community service order system, there were images of people on community service orders working on chain gangs. What has been learnt from that experience? There was some hesitation on this matter when it was originally introduced. I should be interested to hear from the Minister what has been learnt from that experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not to detain the Committee for too long, but I shall try and follow up the points made by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the payment in default of a fine in respect of a juvenile whose parent has become responsible for the fine, if the court has determined that the parent or guardian should pay the fine, it is the parent or guardian, who is under an order to the court, who would be responsible and who could, in theory, be imprisoned for default of payment. That must be the case as it would normally be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the deferment of sentence and whether it could be misused by the judiciary or the magistracy in Northern Ireland, the law in this area has not been changed by the order. The power to defer sentences is exercisable only if the offender consents and the court is satisfied that it is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deferment of sentences is intended to provide an opportunity for the offender to show good behaviour or to help in other ways. A deferred sentence is not supervised and no conditions can be attached to it. That has always been the case. Case law provides guidance as to the procedure to be adopted by the courts in Northern Ireland, and that will continue to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked why the order would not deal with the law on rape. The answer is that the Northern Ireland Office will conduct a wide-ranging review of the legislation in Northern Ireland. We shall undertake that shortly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
with a view to the introduction of a sexual offences order. Any changes to the law on rape would be more appropriately dealt with in such an order, after the usual consultation and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the difference between an absolute and conditional discharge, criminal records and a ban to employment, an absolute or conditional discharge is a conviction for the purposes of a criminal record, but may bar a person from employment if the connection was for a sexual offence. It is excepted from the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1978. The difference in the two disposals is only that a conditional discharge is conditional on a person not committing further offences within a specified period whereas, of course, the absolute discharge means that no further action is to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's points and that the Committee is satisfied to proceed with the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you seeking further illumination, Mr. Worthington?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indeed, Sir Giles. We are not yet halfway through the order so I was hoping to ask further questions. I am sorry for dealing with the issue in such a logical way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On articles 26 to 29, which deal with release on conditions and the supervision of sexual offenders, why have the Government not taken the opportunity to stipulate that the victim of a sexual offender should be informed of the location or the date of the release of the offender? We should link that to my earlier point about giving the probation service unrealistic tasks. The probation service does not want to give a false impression of security to the community by taking up the task of supervision when it might be much more appropriate to write in the condition that the sexual offender should have treatment or continue to have treatment after release and be under the supervision of the people providing that treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 37, it would be interesting to know about the impact of the 28-day remand system in England and Wales. I remember serving on the Committee which dealt with taking similar action in England and Wales to get rid of the seven-day remand and to move to 28-day remand. This is an important matter. There were fears that moving to the 28-day remand would increase the number of delays in the system because it would take the pressure off those who were preparing a case to come to court. One of the characteristics of the Northern Ireland justice system which has been criticised has been the length of time between an arrest and a case being brought to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware of the different system in Scotland where the 110-day rule requires a case to be brought to court within that time. That has proved extremely effective in ensuring that there are no unsatisfactory delays. The Minister may remember that the matter was raised when we were discussing the emergency provisions legislation; one of the criticisms concerning schedule offences was of lengthy delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Article 46 originates from the royal commission which said that when an imputation is made by a defendant on the character of a deceased victim of an alleged crime, the defendant must expect to be the subject of cross-examination about any previous convictions he or she may have. The royal commission also said that when the attack was central to the defence, it should not, of itself, expose the accused to cross-examination on his or her previous convictions. No such exception is made in the order. The recommendation of the royal commission has been changed. Will the Government explain why that change has been made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 47 covers another important area—abolition of the common law requirement that a warning be given by the court to the jury on the dangers of convicting on uncorroborated evidence when the evidence is that of an alleged accomplice and in sex cases. We have no objection to altering the rules on corroborated evidence in the case of sexual offences. We understand the circumstances in which it would be difficult to obtain corroborative evidence, but alleged accomplices are a sensitive issue in Northern Ireland, particularly after the supergrass trials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights considered the matter back in 1983-84, far from recommending the abolition of the corroborative warning, it recommended that a more stringent requirement should be introduced, adding to the corroborative warning, so long as the method of dealing with such cases remained in Diplock courts. Why have the Government moved away from that position and abolished that warning when risks are associated with such a move?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 54 refers to the making of magistrates courts rules on the furnishing of advance information by the prosecution in criminal cases. It is obviously a step forward for the fairness of trials in court that advance information should be provided by the prosecution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to ensure that I am following the hon. Gentleman. Article 54 covers the sale of knives and certain articles and I believe that he is referring to article 52, which covers the rules on the furnishing of information by the prosecution in criminal cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Giles. Your alertness astonishes me and I can only commend you for your helpfulness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 52 refers to the making of magistrates courts rules on the furnishing of advance information by the prosecution in criminal cases. If such information is made available in advance it will obviously result in fairer trials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two questions about that matter. First—to raise a question that comes up on many occasions and in every Committee that I serve on—what is the meaning of the word "may", and when does "may" mean "shall"? In article 52(1), does "may" mean "shall"? When that issue is raised, I am assured by
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Ministers that people's trepidation about the word "may" is ill placed and that it does in fact mean "shall". Will the Minister clear up its meaning in that article?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, article 52(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall not be open to a person convicted of an offence to appeal against the conviction on the grond that … the prosecution"—</p></blockquote>
failed to comply with a disclosure requirement. Surely that is wrong. A requirement that advance information should be provided may be involved; in that case, there should be grounds for an appeal if it is not provided by the prosecution, especially if it is knowingly not provided. If advance information is considered vital to the defence, surely it is illogical to say that one cannot appeal when one is not given the relevant advance information because it could not be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, article 55—I hope that that is the right article—deals with the provision of information—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Article 55 refers to article 26(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. I believe that the Hon. Gentleman is searching for article 56.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right. Article 56 is about the provision of information, and we regard it as a major contribution. I am sure the Minister will agree that the justice system has not always been as transparent as it should be—it has tended to be a secretive world in which much public money is used, and it is not always clear whether that money has been wisely used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Scotland intends to publish information about sentencing practices; I do not know whether the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will do the same. It should be easier to find out where delays occur in the system. To use the old cliche, justice delayed can be justice denied. More information about expenditure and incomes would also be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister interpret the powers in article 56(1)(a)? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall publish such information as he considers expedient for the purpose of"—</p></blockquote>
and it goes on to list only two reasons why he may publish that information. We cannot add to that under the current procedure. The first reason is that the information should enable
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons engaged in the administration of criminal justice to become aware of the financial implications of their decisions".</p></blockquote>
How widely does the Secretary of State intend to interpret that power? It could be interpreted in a narrow way, which would not be helpful, or in an expansive way, which would make available much information about the strengths and weaknesses of the criminal justice system. How does the Minister interpret the article? What information is likely to be made available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.5 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall again attempt to answer the tranche of questions that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie raised, beginning with that relating to remand. The change in the law will reflect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
the reality of dealing with remand cases. At present, remand is for eight days but in practice that period is generally too short to allow any meaningful stage to be reached in a case. It is perfectly possible for a court to remand for a shorter period if it thinks that that is in the best interests of justice. Scheduled offences are, of course, remanded for up to 28 days to reflect the reality of the situation and it seems reasonable to extend the provision to all other offenders where it has worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 35 refers to remands. In cases scheduled under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996—of blessed memory—which deals in general with terrorist cases, the court has power to remand an accused person for up to 28 days unless the case can proceed before them. Implementation of the procedure appears to have worked well from the information that I have received on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 46 deals with corroboration. The Government recognise the concern about the abolition of corroboration warnings in sexual cases. However, the purpose of the legislation is not to end the practice of corroboration warnings altogether. The judge will be under an obligation to ensure a fair trial. Warnings will continue to be required in most cases. The judge will be able to use his discretion to tailor a warning to fit the circumstances of a case. Similar reforms were enacted in England and Wales in section 32 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 as a result of recommendation 195 of the royal commission on criminal justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advising the victim of the release of a sexual offender would, in the majority of cases, be good practice. However, to make it a statutory obligation would, in certain cases, lay the released offender open to attack or persecution. That is especially true in the present security situation in Northern Ireland where people are attacked in the most horrendous way. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie may agree with the Government that the matter is best dealt with through discretion and good practice rather than by imposing a statutory obligation which could have disastrous consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision for appeal in article 52 should be read in conjunction with the new disclosure regime in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. The prosecution will be required to make disclosure in advance of trial. That will provide a more appropriate avenue of appeal for those who claim that an improper disclosure was not made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 44, which deals with imputation on character, replicates section 31 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. It amends section 1(f) of the Criminal Evidence Act (Northern Ireland) 1923 by providing that if an accused person asks questions which attack or question the character of a deceased victim of an alleged crime, he in turn may be asked questions as to his character. That seems right. Why should an accused be able to cast doubt on the character of a deceased victim—who, for obvious reasons, cannot respond—without putting his own character into question?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Article 56 refers to the information that is to be published. I contend that it is vital that management practices and criminal justice processes are, and are seen to be, devoid of improper discrimination. The information is intended to be along the lines of that published by the Home Office under the corresponding provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The first such publication, "Gender and the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice System", will be issued in January 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to help the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie. I hesitate to say that I hope that, as far as he is concerned, that concludes the business, in case it has not. I see that the hon. Member for Maryhill is seeking to intervene and I shall allow her to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I had to leave the Committee Room for a few minutes. When I came back, I heard the Minister say that he wanted discretion to be retained on whether to notify the victim of sexual assault when the perpetrator was released from prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand his point about the danger of people taking the law into their own hands and committing appalling crimes in revenge in such circumstances. Nevertheless, women or children who had been victims of such a crime would also be concerned if they saw without warning the person who raped or otherwise assaulted them turn up in their street or neighbourhood. That is also unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What reassurance can we give those victims about the exercise of such discretion? I should have thought that at least the local police should be informed when someone has been released from gaol, and extra safeguarding of that person's victim should be considered. Sometimes the person who has been released returns to the area not because he wishes to retain his old connections but because he wants to continue to harrass the victim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I anticipate that the provision will be sparingly used, for all reasons that the hon. Member for Maryhill has given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no desire not to follow the spirit of the proposal, but I am sure that the hon. Lady and the other members of the Committee will agree that discretion is sometimes a valuable commodity in this type of legislation, particularly in the special circumstances of Northern-Ireland. There may be occasional cases where, peculiarly, the authorities believe that it is in the best interests of preserving life and the tranquility of a district not to give advance information. However, the hon. Lady made her point extremely well and I assure the Committee that the provision will be very sparingly used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
