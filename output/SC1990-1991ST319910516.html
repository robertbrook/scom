	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>That the Committee has considered the Local Authorities (Members' Allowances) Regulations 1991.—[
	<i>Mr. Key.</i>]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other regulations before us, namely the Local Authorities Etc. (Allowance) (Scotland) Regulations 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.31 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The published documents show that some of the regulations in these statutory instruments came into force on 1 March and the remainder on 1 April, before Parliament had the opportunity to discuss them. That is disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with English and Welsh local authorities and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will deal with Scottish authorities. The issue is sensitive and affects thousands of councilors throughout the country. Those people are not wealthy ladies and gentlemen of independent means. They have volunteered to serve their communities and make real sacrifices—of time, money, family commitment and career prospects—to ensure that democracy continues in their localities. That is the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is typical of the delay, postponements and lack of consultation that have attended the Government's handling of the regulations that Parliament has the chance to debate the changes only after they have come into force. That is shameful and an indictment of the Government. We are discussing a measure that affects the livelihoods of councillors throughout the country after its implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Easter, the Government were at pains to stress that their main aim was to strike a proper balance between central Government and local government. The Secretary of State said on the Floor of the House of Commons that he wanted to ask the people what form of local government they wanted. He implied, but did not state, that centralisation had gone too far and that it would be inappropriate to impose solutions on local communities. Now the Government are imposing yet another central solution to a perceived abuse by telling local government how much councillors are worth and how they should be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's acceptance that attendance allowance should be retained, if only as an option, has been welcomed. Most authorities have decided to pay the allowance because, even within the new scheme's constraints, payment per duty recognises that not all
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
councillors can devote the same amount of time to their civic responsibilities. The Government are not content, however, to set a maximum figure for members' allowances. They prescribe percentages of the overall quantum for different sorts of payment, require payment of special responsibility allowances, define those who can receive such payments and tie attendance allowance to formal meetings, overlooking the various other duties that a councillor must perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Government and Housing Act 1989 is firmly, but selectively, rooted in the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee, which were replicated in the White Paper. It appears, however, that members' allowances will also be included in the Secretary of State's review of local government. Will the Minister confirm that that is the case? If so, will there be genuine and meaningful consultation on the formulation of the new scheme? Will the promised commission to consider members' allowances receive evidence on this issue? Who will be invited to give evidence? Will any notice be taken of the views expressed by the various organisations, including the Association of Councillors? Will the Minister give us an assurance that there will be no faulting on any Government proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fashionable for the Government and for individual members of the Government to admit that mistakes have been made. Are the Government admitting that the 1989 scheme fails to recognise the valuable, varied and demanding role of elected councillors? Are the Government ready at long last to take a more objective look at improving the system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe report, Command 9797, stated in paragraph 6.106 that, once fixed, the levels of allowances should be regularly and objectively reviewed. We support it on that issue, and note that the members of the committee added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot condone the manner in which attendance allowance has been allowed arbitrarily to fall in real value since its introduction. The original maximum daily allowance was£10. Had it kept in line with average earnings it would have been about£40 per day in 1985–86. In fact it was then£16.</p></blockquote>
Yet the new scheme continues to leave any uprating in the hands of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Across political party lines, the Association of District Councils, the Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities are agreed that there should be an objective mechanism for the annual uplift of allowances. It should not be left to the Secretary of State'to decide whether there should be an increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe report acknowledged that the committee's proposals did not deal with the problems of pensions and benefits. Paragraph 6.111 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>We have not proposed changes because the issues relate more generally to taxation and social security, and extend beyond our remit. We hope, however, that they will be pursued by others."</p></blockquote>
Work on this pressing problem has been in abeyance since 1988. The Department of the Environment has now written to local authority associations, proposing a July meeting to consider a revised code of guidance. This we welcome, but there should be a full review, with recommendations that address key areas, not merely restate the position. Again, the Government's request is issued across party lines in local government. I ask the Minister to consider the proposed July meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have promised that the scheme will be reviewed at the end of the first year of operation. Local authorities are worried that the review will be confined to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
patterns of spending and will not take account of fundamental principles and problems. The review mechanism need not wait a further year because section 18(4)(c) of the 1989 Act allows regulations to be made which.
	<br><blockquote><p>"contain such incidental provision and such supplemental, consequential and transitional provisions in connection with other provisions of the regulations as the Secretary of State considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
It is clear that the Government will not scrap the new scheme before it comes in, but they have the power to improve the scheme by regulation and they should seize the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment's commitment to the review at about the end of the first year that is given in its recently published circular is welcome, but it does not answer our question about the terms of reference of the review? Again, I ask the Minister to consider those terms of reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members' allowances cannot be considered separately from leave arrangements. The Government have adopted the Widdicombe committee's proposal to impose a ceiling on the paid leave of a council employee who may be allowed to undertake council duties, but they have apparently done nothing about the committee's other recommendation on paid leave, namely that private sector employers should take a positive and flexible attitude to granting paid and unpaid leave to employees carrying out council duties. Individual employees must still negotiate "reasonable" time off under section 29 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. Codes of practice for local government abound yet there is no similar statutory guidance for the public sector. Will the Minister also look at that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe Committee recommended the abolition of attendance allowance and financial loss allowance and the Government conceded the option for local authorities to pay attendance allowance if they wished. However, the Government have painted themselves into a corner in that allowing elected members to claim financial loss allowance would require primary legislation. At the same time, magistrate members of police committees who are not yet restricted to the deliberative or consultative role recommended by the Widdecombe committee may still claim financial loss allowance. A magistrate sitting on a police committee can claim financial loss allowance but a locally elected councillor sitting on the same committee is denied that privilege. Perhaps the Minister could explain why that is allowed to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government regard it as administratively ineffective to allow councillors to claim the allowance but it is perfectly in order for magistrates to claim even though they are not accountable to the local community and, in many instances, receive their payment from, the same clerk in the local authority. The numbers of those who are claiming are relatively small, but continuing to handle such claims is no more complicated than administering provisions for the new scheme. We see no reason why the claim of financial loss allowance should not operate within the claims by local councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint authorities are creations of the Government, and arise from the abolition of the Greater London council and the metropolitan districts, but the new scheme does not treat them fairly. The passenger transport authorities, in particular, remind the Government that they are not simply former metropolitan county council committees given
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
separate status but carrying out the same essential functions. They have a significant role in their communities. Passenger transport authorities have had to face dramatic changes through bus deregulation, and instability has arisen from the constant change in the bus network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are the joint police authorities. As the Minister knows, West Yorkshire joint police authority has said that the new system of payment of allowances is unworkable and unfair and that it should be scrapped and replaced with a more liberal scheme applied by the local authorities involved with the joint police authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Sumberg: 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman any idea how much all his proposed changes will cost the local taxpayer? If he has, will he tell the Committee? Will he confirm that they would necessitate an increase in Government grant to local councils? How much would that cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman have any idea how much it costs to run the quangos appointed by the Department of the Environment? The chairman of the British Waterways Association receives£36,397; the deputy chairman receives£9,601; each member of the board receives£7,279. The Housing Corporation, which has a budget of£956 million—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will not stray too far from what we are discussing. The statutory instrument is clear. If the hon. Member thinks that he is still in order, I invite him to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making the point that the Department of the Environment has decided the level of payment for those who are appointed to various corporations that involve local government and the level of payment for the leader and members of local authorities. We are dealing with local authority activities and people who serve local authorities. The difference is that the people who I have defended were elected; the people I am referring to now are appointed. Both groups carry out local government responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the urban development corporations, the work that the chairman of the planning committee and the leader of the local authority did is now carried out by someone who is appointed. The job is the same, but the difference in salaries is startling. That was the point that I was making to the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Sumberg).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And very effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us consider the Milton Keynes development corporation, which has a local authority function. The total gross expenditure of that body is£340 million. The chairman receives£44,742 and members receive£6,837. The budgets of the joint committees of West Yorkshire police, the passenger transport authority and even some of the larger authorities are comparable to that of Milton Keynes development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Telford development corporation's expenditure is less than£85 million—there are education authorities that spend more than that—but its chairman receives£18,202; its deputy chairman£8,272; and its members£3,735.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The budget is£39.5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a sedentary intervention. If he wishes, the hon. Gentleman may ignore such interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always pleased to help the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the figures that the hon. Gentleman has quoted, does he agree with Sir Cyril Smith—the hon. Member for Rochdale—that it is a scandal that the Labour leader of Rochdale council, which has a budget of£150 million, received allowances of£14,700 in 1990 to 1991?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister should not refer to hon. Members by name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister meant to refer to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Sir C. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such figures include subsistence, travelling, special responsibility and attendance allowances. I am referring to salaries that are paid to various individuals. The£18,202 salary of the chairman of the Telford development corporation does not include travelling expenses or subsistence allowance. Under the new proposals that will be imposed by the Government, the leader of Rochdale Council could receive a maximum of£7,500. Yet, with a budget of less than £40 million, the chairman of the Telford development corporation—the Secretary of State sets the salaries, and I am using his figures—is paid£18,202; the deputy chairman£8,272; and members£3,735. What is the justification for such salaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not yet put the Question. I shall do so when the hon. Member finishes his opening speech. If the hon. Member could finish it quickly, we could begin the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is rather amusing, because I have only just begun to start firing, Mr Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comparisons. Can he tell us why Scottish councillors currently receive twice as much in allowances as English councillors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart will deal with Scottish local authorities. Therefore, I wish to leave the unarmed combat about the Scottish to the Scottish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bristol development corporation has an expenfliture of£5.1 million—much less than that which is spent by the education, social services and environmental health committees of local authorities. Some of the small authorities in the shire counties will have budgets much larger than that of the Bristol development corporation. According to the Department of the Environment, the chairman of the Bristol development corporation is worth more than£16,000, in relation to a budget of just over£5 million. The deputy chairman of that corporation is worth£4,800 and each member of the committee is worth£4,250. How can Conservative Members justify the difference between those allowances and the allowances of elected members, who are accountable to their local electorate and receive£1,000 a year—a mere pittance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Leeds development corporation has a budget of less than£9 million. The social services department in Leeds will spend much more than that on statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
responsibilities. The education department will spend seven or eight times that sum. Yet the chairman of the Leeds development corporation gets£16,000, the deputy chairman get£4,888 and each member gets£4,250. How can the Minister justify that? Those people serve local government in the same way as elected members of local authorities, and it is hypocritical that there should be a vast discrepancy in the values placed on appointed and elected members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give many other examples, but I am mindful of your request, Mr. Hill. The situation of elected members, compared with appointed members, must be placed on record. I hope that the Minister will deal with the issues that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.57 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by saying that it is a pleasure to be serving under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Hill, and to be a member of the Committee. I am sure that the debate will be extremely well informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here to consider an important matter—how we run our local services through locally elected councillors. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) caused me to wonder whether he was referring to the regulations that we are here to discuss. The regulations were laid before Parliament on 28 February and it has taken the Opposition 10 weeks to get around to praying against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. That is incorrect. When the regulations were laid, we prayed against them. It is the management of the Government's affairs that is responsible for the fact that it has taken 10 weeks to get a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have been happy to debate the regulations on 29 February. I assume that the usual channels found it impossible to bring the matter forward earlier. Let us not quibble—let us pursue the important matters that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was full consultation with the local authority associations over the new system. Parliament debated the matter extensively during the passage of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. The regulations settle the details of the scheme that was approved by Parliament in 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discussed this part of the 1989 measure before it became an Act, we asked what the value of the allowances would be. At that time no figures were given, so it was impossible properly to discuss the matter. However, we criticised the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. In 1989 we discussed the underlying principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system allows local authorities more discretion than the old system. Let me remind the Committee of the principles behind the scheme. The need for the regulations was clearly identified by the Widdicombe committee to tackle the abuses noted in its report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What abuses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were identified not by the Government but by the Widdicombe committee, and were fully debated back in 1989. The principles on which the new scheme is based were extensively debated and the key elements were proposed by the chairmen of the three English and Welsh

local authority associations. The regulations will permit overall expenditure on allowances of about£49 million. That sum exceeds in real terms, by about £10 million, what authorities were estimated to be spending overall in 1989, when the earlier debates took place. We have undertaken to review the scheme in the first part of 1992. That does not sound to me like a heartless scheme that has been imposed on unwilling local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Minister leaves that point, I seek his guidance. There is a curious problem. When a council is Conservative controlled, the number of meetings called by councillors seems to dwindle dramatically. If that council then becomes Labour controlled, the number of meetings escalates very quickly. The interpretation that the less generous might put upon that is that meetings are increased to give access to increased fees. How do the regulations deal with that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has identified one of the subjects about which the Widdicombe committee had quite a lot to say. It was debated extensively in 1989 when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment undertook his full review of local government. That includes a consultation paper on the internal management of local authorities, which we hope will be published shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the remarks about generosity and how good the regulations are, would the Minister comment on the remark made by Councillor John Young, of Glasgow district council? He is a member of the same party as the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. When the regulations were introduced, he said that

	<p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister continues, I have a point to make following the remarks of the hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste). Bradford council turned Tory and I do not believe that there was a vast difference in the number of meetings held. The Tories were kicked out after two years. The electorate in Bradford preferred a Labour administration to a Tory one. Decisions should be taken by means of the ballot box. The electorate decides such issues. The Prime Minister says that he wants to give more freedom to the ratepayers and introduce a citizens' charter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the electorate will choose on the basis of the citizens' charter which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is working out. When the electorate realises that some councils have been ripping it off, it will vote for Conservative councils. It was a tragedy that my party lost control of Bradford after the valiant work of Councillor Pickles, who tried to improve the quality, standards and the enabling role of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being led astray. There is no need for him to react to remarks made by Opposition Members from a sedentary position. Will the hon. Gentleman confine his comments to local government allowances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Hill. I shall be delighted to do so. However, I am enthusiast for local government, and I take every opportunity to trumpet its successes and to decry its shortcomings when they exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system sets an overall limit for each council within the budget to which I referred earlier. The remuneration of councillors is based on the principle of voluntary public service. I am sure that Oppositions Members do not disagree with that important principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of leading my hon. Friend the Minister astray. However, when referring to the voluntary service, he must take into account what I regard as the fundamental issue involved in local government. The day-to-day management of local government departments is most effective when it is undertaken by full-time local government officers. It is up to councillors to give strategic directions. The difficulty with Labour-controlled authorities is that the councillors are increasingly taking over the day-to-day departmental responsibilities. They are incompetent to run the departments because they have not received the proper training, and they are now asking the Government for more money so that they can continue running the departments as they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that my hon. Friend is correct. As I said earlier, the hon. Member for Rochdale (Sir C. Smith) feels strongly about the matter. He suffers under a Labour-controlled council. In a letter to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Leader of Rochdale Council in my local Press on Wednesday, says. I am responsible for a budget of£150 million. What arrogant nonsensel He then tells us he spends more than 50 hours a week on Local Government. I am sure he does, the question is why, and should he! He has an office (as has his Deputy)—fridges, computers, carpets, lavish furniture etc. etc., and here in a small Council of just over 200,000 population, he has received£14,700 for allowances, etc., in 1990–91. Where on earth are we going? Why employ Chief Executives, Accountants, Solicitors, etc., if inexperienced unqualified people, who would fail in industry, are allowed to behave like Ayatollahs! It is nonsense! I urge you to seriously STOP all allowances to councillors other than expenses actually incurred."</p></blockquote>
That is not my analysis of the position but that of the hon. Member for Rochdale. I am only sorry that there are not representatives of the Liberal Democrat party in Committee, which means that I cannot argue the point with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the Minister advanced the perfect argument for having his salary reduced to the same level as that of a leader of a council or a chairman of a committee? Given all his advisers, is he not in the same position as such people? His advisers—from permanent secretaries downwards—are paid high salaries and presumably undertake similar work to that done by chief executives and the staff of local authorities. Should not the Minister be paid the level of salary that he is suggesting for leaders and chairmen of local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Gentleman to read the consultation paper that will soon be published on the internal management of local authorities. He will find that his view of the management of local authorities differs from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
that of mine. The best authorities are those that are operated by high-quality chief executives. That system gives the elected members the freedom to decide policy, but not to interfere in the day-to-day executive management of the authority. The hon. Gentleman does not have a leg to stand on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider that members of the Committee who represent Scotland should be allowed to speak. Will the consultation document to which the Minister referred deal with attendance allowances and the remuneration of councillors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the remuneration of councillors is based on the principle of voluntary public service. The purpose of paying allowances to councillors is principally to ensure that they do not suffer financial hardship, and to ensure that a wide range of different types of person is able to stand for membership. The allowances have never been regarded by any political party as salaries—they are for the reimbursement of expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government remain of the view that representative local democracy draws great strength from being based on voluntary public service. But the committee will be aware that the Government have initiated a wide-ranging review of local government including finance, structure and internal management. A consultation paper on internal management will be published shortly, and we shall be examining the role of councillors in that context. A number of options is being considered, including ones in which relatively few councillors might take up full-time executive positions for which it would be appropriate that they should be paid a salary. I do not want to pre-empt the consultation paper, but I thought it right that I should draw the Committee's attention to the consideration the Government are currently giving to those issues. However, for the majority of councilors, the Government do not envisage any change to the present basis on which they are remunerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time ago, the hon. Member for Normanton asked me whether the local government commission would consider such matters. The role of the commission is to settle the application of any changes to local circumstances. The main lines of the changes will be settled by legislation, not by the commission, and the system of remuneration is a matter for legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee recommended regular reviews, and the Government have reviewed the matter regularly since 1979 and made appropriate changes. We have given undertakings to continue to do so. There is no reason why councillors' pay should be treated differently from the rest of public sector pay. The drop in the value of allowances occurred between 1974 and 1979 when, as I recall, another party was in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review will cover any matters that the local authority associations wish to raise, and I stress that we have made progress in that regard through consultation with those associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial loss allowance, to which the hon. Member for Normanton referred, is an important matter, It is also important to recall that, in Scotland, 2 per cent., and in England, 1 per cent., of councillors chose the financial loss
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
allowance when it was available. Therefore, there was no case for complicating the system with FLA for councillors and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities made no representations on the matter. Incidentally, the FLA is the normal form of allowance for magistrates. That is why there is a difference, which the hon. Member for Normanton, quite rightly, drew to the attention of the Committee. It is the main allowance for magistrates. They also receive travelling and subsistence allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to financial loss allowance for magistrates and not for elected members and said that that is why there is a difference between the two. An elected member can claim travelling expenses and subsistence allowances under the new regulations. What is the difference between a lay member, a magistrate on a police committee, and an elected member?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly a difference of function in that one is an elected councillor and the other is not an elected person. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman referred to the£7,500 limit on expenses but, of course, that applies only to special responsibility allowances. The basic allowance and the attendance allowance will be in addition to that, so there is no cut-off point at£7,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of how much money should be made available for expenditure on allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making a comparison between the leader of a local authority and the chairman of an urban development corporation. Allowances are payable to the chairman. How can the Minister justify the fact that a chairman of an urban development corporation with an expenditure of less than£5 million gets a gratuity of£16,000 a year while the leader of a local authority with an expenditure of£250 million gets£7,500?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that that is entirely just when very experienced people are asked to take on a responsibility for which they are being remunerated—for example, the chairmanship of a UDC. As for local authorities, people are asked to come forward for voluntary public service. It is a different tradition and the comparison is entirely false. I would not expect those who run Walworth Road or Conservative central office to be paid at a much lower rate than people in a comparable walk of life outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might make some sense for chairmen, although I do not agree with the Minister. Members of an industrial tribunal or a rent assessment panel volunteer for public service. They do not have to serve; no one makes them do it. In Scotland a chairman is presently paid£179 per day; members are paid£82 per day, which, for a five day week, 52 weeks a year, is about£21,000 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is straying rather a long way. That comparison is not particularly realistic. I do not wish to pre-empt the consultation paper to be published shortly; the Opposition will have the chance to make those comparisons, if appropriate, following its publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is how much money should be made available for expenditure on allowances. It is true that the Widdicombe committee proposed a much higher level of allowances in real terms than we have allowed for. However, I remind the Committee that the White Paper response to the Widdicombe report made it clear that we saw no convincing case for a substantial increase in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
expenditure on councillors' allowances, given the principles on which the system should be based, which I have already discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have more than honoured our earlier commitments that the total expenditure on allowances permitted under the new system would certainly be no less than the existing level of spending. The local authority associations estimated in 1989, when the Bill was before the House, that councils would spend about£37 million on the main allowances if all councillors claimed their entitlement. However, not all councillors claim their full entitlement and the estimated expenditure was about£33 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, we decided that the allocations to individual authorities should be subject to an upper maximum of£42 million at 1989–90 prices. We have carefully updated that figure in line with movements in costs. The figure for 1991–92, the first year of operation of the new system, is about£49 million. As I have said, we have fully met our undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that quantum, we have established allocations per councillor by local authority type and size for the non-metropolitan district councils in England and Wales. I emphasise that in determining the respective levels of allowance, the Government do not intend to imply that members serving, for example, on district councils are any less hard-working or committed than their counterparts in metropolitan areas or on county councils. But we had to take account of the differing work loads and functions of each type of authority. We also accepted the argument of certain district councils that the size of their areas and populations implied greater demands on their councillors' time than the average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of joint authorities, we had to make a judgment about their single-service responsibilities in relation to the varied tasks of the metropolitan districts and London boroughs. On the basis of evidence collected by the AMA we increased from£500 to£800 the allocation per councillor for those authorities and updated that amount to take account of movements in costs subsequently. The present figure is£870.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, some high-spending authorities will have had to make adjustments to accommodate expenditure on allowances within the ceilings imposed under the new system. We have provided transitional arrangements in the regulations to allow for that. For many authorities, those arrangements are, of course, unnecessary because they were spending well within the maximum permissible when the new system was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the framework which the regulations prescribe for the payment of allowances. I have mentioned already that we worked closely with the local authority associations in drawing up our proposals for a new system of allowances. We listened carefully to the views of local government. In particular, we moved significantly from the original proposals in our White Paper for a simple, flat-rate allowance, accepting that local authorities should continue to be able to pay an element of attendance allowance to their members if they wanted to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcomed the proposals put to us by the three main English and Welsh local authority associations. They proposed that the potential for abusing the attendance-allowance based system which existed at the time could be limited by restricting the range of approved duties or by
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
placing a limit on the total payable by each council. Those two key features were built into the regulations that we are considering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We firmly believe that the new system represents a distinct improvement on the one it replaces. With some modifications, the new arrangements carry forward the Widdicombe committee's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time, the new system places a ceiling on how much a local authority may pay by way of allowances. Within their overall ceiling local authorities now have discretion, subject to certain limits specified in the regulations, to decide how to allocate their budgets between the three types of allowance—that is basic, special responsibility and attendance allowances. Payment of attendance allowance is optional. Fine loss allowance is no longer payable to councillors in the main local authorities. The new system therefore places accountability for spending decisions on allowances where it belongs—with the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where an authority chooses to do so, it may also pay attendance allowances for duties specified in its scheme, which must come within the definition of specified duties in the regulations. As I have said, Councillors may no longer claim financial loss allowance. The Widdicombe committee found that only about 1 per cent. of councillors were claiming the allowance—or in other words about 250 councillors. Nonetheless, the decision was of great concern to many in the local authority world. I believe the decision to have been the right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, will respond later in the light of comments from Scottish members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome this opportunity to debate the regulations. I have already said that we are looking at councillors' remuneration in the context of the local government review. But that does not mean that we have closed our minds to looking at the need to change aspects of the current system, if there is a compelling case for doing so. We have already undertaken, therefore, to review next year the operation of the system covered by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations flow from the Widdicombe committee's proposals and the detailed research on which those proposals were based. They are the result of extensive discussion in the House and outside with the local authority associations. They make more than reasonable provision for overall expenditure on allowances when judged against recent actual levels of spending.

I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it offensive to hear people dismiss the efforts of councillors, many of whom work extremely hard. Members of this place receive £29,000 a year or more, regardless of the number of hours that they put in, regardless of the worth of their efforts. They think that it is up to the electorate to decide whether they deserve to be restored to their job when there is a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillors should be in the same position. It is for electorates to decide whether councillors are doing a job for them. The issue is straightforward. If, a few years ago, we Members of Parliament could find an appropriate civil service grade to reflect the work that we do and award ourselves the salary that is paid to the civil servants in that grade, I see no reason why that cannot be done for councillors. The genuine difficulty is the huge variation in hours put in. Some tiny councils require only a few hours' work on week nights; others, in areas such as Strathclyde, require a full-time commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be perfectly straightforward to find an appropriate civil service grade and pay pro rata for the number of hours put in. That is the system that we should be working towards, instead of finding ways of grossly underpaying people for doing jobs that carry enormous responsibility. For example, the chair of Glasgow district council's finance committee is paid less than the most junior employee who is on grade GS12 at 17 years of age. The leader of Strathclyde regional council receives a£6,000 special responsibility payment in addition to the£5,400 basic allowance. the authority is vast, with an electorate of about 2.3 million, so a great deal of effort is put into the job. It seems ludicrous that that is all that is paid for such responsibility. In commerce and industry, those people would be drawing fortunes. The lack of comparability betweeen their responsibilities and what they earn is ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other injustices, which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). Why, for example, is a councillor paid a mileage allowance of 25·8p a mile while a Member of Parliament, with the same type of car, is paid 60p a mile? In addition, Members of Parliament do not have to account for their mileage unless they drive more than 500 miles a month, while concillors must account for every trip that they make. I am not suggesting that people should fiddle the books, but why are hon. Members trusted to be honourable and councillors are not? Why is there such a distinction between the way that councillors are treated and the way that we treat ourselves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time off from work is another vital aspect that needs considering if we are to ensure that councillors really represent the breadth of the population. The problem of getting time off from work is very serious; for many years it has been difficult for people in private industry to have time off for council duties because their employers are so unwilling to allow them to take it. That means an imbalance in the type of people who put themselves forward for election. Typically, they are people who have their own business and can employ someone to keep things ticking over in their absence, retired persons or people who work in the public sector, whose employers tend to be more sympathetic to their taking time off for such matters than those in private industry. That imbalance is wrong; there should be a statutory right to have appropriate time off and that should be undeniable, no matter what industry people work in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that local authorities and public sector employers are often sympathetic about time off. However, they do not pay councillors when they take time off for council duties.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I was a Glasgow councillor for a number of years. Taking unpaid leave to carry out my duties, I regularly lost more than £2,000 a year. That is typical of the sums that are lost. It is all very well for others to say that it is voluntary service, but we are here on voluntary service. No one compels anyone to become a Member of Parliament, but we have chosen to award ourselves a salary for our efforts. If people volunteer to stand for election to a council, what is the great difference in principle between them and us? They are paid a pittance and we award ourselves a decent salary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</div> <!-- member -->

Private employers run businesses. We are in a recession, as the Labour party keeps saying. Employers cannot disrupt their business activities to ensure that local government continues.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations and, to some extent, the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, are an attack on local government. Without difficulty, I can name three senior Scottish Conservative councillors who have condemned the Government's treatment of councillors' allowances. I have already quoted John Young. There is also Brian Meek, who was leader of the Conservatives on Lothian regional council, and Christine Richards. The hon.

Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, may think of the first two councillors that I mentioned as being on the left of his party, but could not so consider Christine Richards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be, but it does not matter. Much of the world's population would fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All three councillors condemned the Government's treatment of allowances. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, said that everything would be reconsidered in the Government's review of local government, that we could comment on matters then and that there could be further changes. If that is to be so, why do the Government not withdraw the regulations and allow the existing system to continue to operate until the review is complete and legislation has been passed by Parliament? The Minister's defence of the regulations is that the Government are doing one thing now and will do another in a few month's time. Such arguments are absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is astonishing that Ministers continue to use what happened under the Labour Government to defend their actions. I, and others, though I was not a councillor at the time, objected to the Labour Government's failure to upgrade council allowances. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) objected too. The Conservative party did not raise much of an outcry, but we did. For the past 12 years, the Government have based much of their policy on a principle that I was taught as a young child was incorrect—that two wrongs make a right. The fact that the Labour Government were wrong does not mean that the present Conservative Government is right because it continues with a policy that is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, in his reply, cannot use English local government as a comparator for allowances, when yesterday in Scottish Question Time, he and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland argued that there could be no commission on local government in Scotland, as opposed to England, because English local government was so different from Scottish local government. The Government cannot today argue that the two systems are essentially the same and that there is nothing to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what the Minister said yesterday, on television with me and in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are a further Government attack on local government. Conservative Members may not appreciate that the large Scottish local authorities cannot be run by part-time, volunteer councillors. It was a leading Conservative councillor in Scotland who said that both Strathclyde regional council and Lothian regional council deal with budgets that are larger than those of 80 nations in the United Nations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the right way for large authorities to be run is to have competent, well-qualified full-time executives? What they need from councillors are policy guidelines on how to run their affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if something goes wrong in a local authority he blames the chief executive, the director of education or someone like that? Of course he does not. He blames the elected member. That is right. Elected members are there to take responsibility for policy and what happens in the local authority just as Ministers take responsibility for their actions. Ministers are paid highly for doing that and elected members of local authorities should also be paid according to their responsibility and the policy decisions that they take. Responsibility should not be left to chief executives, who are obviously competent and who should get on with their jobs. The policy decisions and the responsibility for those decisions must rest with the elected members who work to see that those decisions are carried out correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not right that the chief executive of Strathclyde region is paid well over £50,000 when the leader of the council, Charles Gray, who has a higher level of responsibility and who works as many if not more hours because unlike the chief executive, he has to attend functions in the evenings and at weekends, is paid the princely sum of£10,840. Does anyone seriously suggest that a person with that level of responsibility should get only that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baptiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two parts of the hon. Gentleman's argument do not add up. He argued that the leader of the council had responsibility for taking policy decisions, and I agree with that. However, it is for the chief executive to implement those policies, which is a full-time, executive job of some complexity. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing for a full-time elected mayors as chief executives of local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not believe that there should be an individual election for one person on a local council to do that job. It is up to the electorate to elect the council and for the council to decide which of its members should play the leading roles at a variety of different levels within the council. Many of those people will be working full time or almost full time, and yet they are paid a pittance to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like doing this but I feel I must put the case of one of my councillors, who I am sure the Scottish Minister will admit is a very capable man in his early 40s. He chairs the economic and industrial development committee of Strathclyde regional council. It is an important committee that is dealing with the possible closure of Ravenscraig and seeking new business and bringing more industry into the region. He is not a full-time paid official and does not quite reach the point where he could be barred from holding council office because of his salary. His salary is£19,500 as a surveyor on Glasgow district council. With the level of work that his chairmanship demands together with his other council duties, he is lucky if he draws£5,000 a year of that annual salary, given the time that he has off to do his job as a councillor. To make up that£14,000, he is being paid just over£6,000 under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want young men with ability to be elected to local government. Are they not the sort of people we require, or do we want local government to be made up of part-time businessmen and retired people? I agree with a voluntary service, but at the same time, men should not have to sacrifice their wives' and children's standard of living to do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the job. Unfortunately, members of some of the larger authorities in Scotland are being forced into that position, which cannot be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking the very question that is being taken up by the Government in the consultation papers. Clearly, it is an important issue that we shall consider. However, that does not pre-empt the importance of ensuring that the regulations are in place. If we fail to do so, the man to which the hon. Gentleman just referred would be worse off, not better off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand that. Under the previous system, the man to whom I referred could either claim a loss of earnings or an attendance allowance. He still lost out, but not as much as he will do so under the regulations. We believe in local democracy and in giving power to those who are elected, not appointed. We want to encourage local democracy and in giving power to those who are elected, not appointed. We want to encourage local democracy and to bring in people with ability who can do the job. We cannot do that if we do not ensure that their quality of life will not suffer because of taking on the job. No one in local government is asking to be paid enormous salaries that will attract people from other jobs into local government, but they are saying that their families should not have to suffer because they are members of a council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that there should be a move towards offering salaries for councillors. Of course, those will be pro rata salaries based on the work that they do. The deputy chairman of Scottish Homes, for example is appointed on a salary of£13,167 on the pro rata basis that his duties will take up one and a half days a week. That is not bad—indeed it is quite substantial. He is also in a full-time job. He is a good man and a distinguished architect. He does not lose out on his partnership as a result of being the deputy chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillors should not lose out either. Of course, the salaries would be on a pro rata basis. Some would be full-time employees in Strathclyde or Lothian, and as I have said those regions handle budgets that are in excess of the budgets of 80 countries in the United Nations. We are not talking about small sums or minor issues. The decisions taken will affect the livelihoods of many people, and often councillors' decisions are of greater importance than those taken by Ministers. In matters such as education and social work, for example, the decisions are just as important as those taken by Ministers. Yet those involved are paid peanuts for doing the job. That is not good enough and it is an attack on local democracy. The Minister has called into aid consultation documents that no one else has seen—perhaps his hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood, the Under Secretary of State for Scotland, has, but we have not. He should allow the old system to operate until it has been properly examined by the Government or us, when we come into power. We believe that there should be paid local councillors to do to job that they are elected to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Carthcart referred to yesterday's television broadcast and made a clear commitment—for which I was politically grateful—that it is Labour party policy that greater Glasgow should take over Eastwood, Bearsden and Milngavie. The hon. Gentleman was somewhat defensive about the Labour Government's record, and he alleged that the regulations are an attack on local government and local democracy. He did not respond to the argument my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State for the Environment that allowances were not increased during the first three and a half years of the present scheme under the Labour Government, despite a high rate of inflation. Under the Conservative Government allowances have been uprated each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carthcart said, on behalf of his party, that he is interested in moving towards a system of salaried local councillors, but did not give any commitment on finance. The hon. Member did not even give a commitment that a Labour Government would uprate the present allowances in line with inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly give way to the hon. Member. I look forward to his next commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has read the Labourt party policy document on Scottish local government and its finance. One of the problems is that the Minister and his Friends spent all their time reading the last five pages of that document, which are about local government finance, and do not read the first part. I shall give a commitment; I shall send the Minister a copy of the document so that he can read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have read that document. I was simply asking the hon. Gentleman to confirm the financial commitment. As the hon. Gentlemanńtalks about local

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
democracy and about moving towards salaries for local authority councillors, it is reasonable to ask as many people are interested how much money the next Labour Government would use to implement that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carthcart, confirms that his speech and commitment are meaningless, as he has made no commitment that a Labour Government would not do as the previous Labour Government did—fail to uprate allowances in line with inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the time left to the Committee, will the Minister attempt to justify what the Government are doing, instead of wasting time attacking what he thinks a Labour Government would do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not attacking the hon. Member for Cathcart. As an honest seeker after truth, I was trying to find out the hon. Gentleman's position. In response to the hon. Member for Maryhill, however, I shall return to the specific changes that the Committee has considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the previous system, 92 per cent. of Scottish local authorities paid the maximum attendance allowance, no matter how long the duty. The previous system undoubtedly encouraged the proliferation of meetings, and some authorities took a wide view of the definition of approved duties, leading to payment for attendance at party meetings and other purely political functions. Who pays for that, at the end of the day? The people whose interests councillors have been elected to serve have to foot the bill. The old system was anything but fair. It took no proper account of size of authority and range of responsibilities. Where was the equity in a system that allowed small district councils to claim more on average than councilors in the largest region? Councillors in one district claimed almost twice as much as those in another district of the same size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cathcart and for Maryhill referred to Strathclyde, Scotland's largest authority, where the estimated average allowance in 1990–91 was£5,074 per annum. Why was it more than£6,000 in Midlothian? How can one justify a system under which, in Cumnock and Doon Valley—a Labour authority with a high level of deprivation—the estimated average allowance in 1990–91 was a modest£2,968, whereas in Clydebank it was£5,944? The Opposition referred to Strathclyde, where the estimated average allowance was more than£5,000. They did not refer to Lothian, where the allowance paid was more than£1,000 greater— £6,092—although Lothian has fewer problems than Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do those levels of payment represent attendance allowance only, or do they include other expenses such as subsistence allowance and travelling costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Travelling costs are not included. I was referring to the estimated average allowance. I am not attacking councils or councillors generally—far from it. My point is that under the previous system there were inexplicable discrepancies. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities defended those discrepancies by saying that they reflected differences in political culture. That is why, in all my comparisons, I referred solely to Labour authorities—authorities of the same party. Why have there been such enormous differences between authorities with
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
comparable problems that are run by the same party? The figures were inexplicable. That is why we needed arrangements that were fairer and more transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline the point made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment in response to the Opposition's protests. An outsider might think that we had introduced our proposals overnight and without consultation, but that is not the case. Our proposals are the result of more than 12 months of detailed discussion and negotiations with the local authority associations, all of which were represented in the joint working group. The hon. Member for Cathcart said that we had changed our proposals. Would he have preferred that we had not consulted and not changed them? He referred to criticisms made by councillor John Young, who will probably have to give up his local council seat after the next general election to become the Conservative Member for Cathcart. He is a valued colleague. The criticisms were not of the revised but of the previous proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made important changes to the original proposals. We reduced the minimum amount to be spent on the special responsibility allowance from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent., we introduced transitional arrangements to help high-spending authorities in response to representations, and, at the request of COSLA, we introduced into Scotland a system of banding. Our proposals were not produced in haste, and the new system is the better for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is dwelling on what the Government have done, will he explain why the statutory instruments make no reference to an understanding between local authorities and the Department of the Environment and the Scottish Office, that underspend at the end of the year can be distributed as an additional special responsibility allowance? Why is such a provision not included in the statutory instruments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know of no statutory instrument that covers aspects of underspend. The hon. Gentleman knows the position. There is no need for such a provision to be set out in the regulations, although they allow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister justify the fact that the new system will give a 100 per cent. increase to the district councils of Badenoch and Strathspey, Skye and Lochalsh, Sutherland, Caithness, Eastwood and Perth and Kinross, but will result in cuts of 6 per cent. in Edinburgh, 8 per cent. in Glasgow and 10 per cent in Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is distance, among other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eastwood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give him the figures for Eastwood. In Eastwood, which is an extremely good and highly-efficient district council, the estimated average allowance in 1990–91 was just over£1,000 per councillor. That compares favourably with the other figures, which I gave earlier in relation to many Labour councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system is fairer. It is also flexible—something for which local authority associations fought hard, and which we were pleased to deliver. Provided that certain requirements are met, local authorities are free to draw up a scheme that best suits their needs and allows councillors who do the most work to be rewarded for their efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
The total resources provided are generous. I underline that fact. We gave a firm and fair commitment that the new scheme would not lead to a reduction in the level of expenditure on councillors' allowances. That commitment we honoured. The Great Britain total for 1991–92 is£49·3 million, of which the Scottish share is£6·2 million. We have received only two complaints about the new system, one of which, related to the treatment of minority councillors in Edinburgh. The system is up and running, and is widely regarded as fair and reasonable. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
