	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Common Agricultural Policy (Agricultural Produce) (Protection of Community Arrangements) (Amendment) Order 1978 (S.I. No. 1660).</p></blockquote>
This is a fairly simple order because it seeks to clarify, in effect, the existing 1973 order and to add two items, peas and field beans, to the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will briefly try to explain the order in relation to the principal order—the Common Agricultural Policy (Agricultural Produce) (Protection of Community Arrangements) (No. 2) Order 1973. As the title implies, its object is to protect funds which may be expended under the common agricultural policy in support of Community regimes. For commodities which are specified in the order a range of powers are provided to safeguard public funds. These include powers to require the keeping, retention and production of records, and so on. That order has already been approved by the House, and we are seeking to clarify or extend it by bringing in an agent as well as other persons involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amending order will ensure that the record-keeping requirements of the 1973 order will apply whether the person or company concerned is acting as a principal or as an agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1973 order clearly applies to a principal in any transaction. But experience has shown that this is not enough and that it is sometimes necessary to require agents to keep the appropriate records and to produce them on demand. It is uncertain whether this can be done under existing powers. Such a gap in the powers could considerably reduce the effectiveness of the 1973 order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly this is detrimental to proper financial control, and article 2 of this amending order ensures that such agents
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
are required to observe the recordkeeping requirements of the 1973 order and to produce their records when required to do so by authorised officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have indicated, the commodities to which the 1973 order applies are listed in the schedule to that order. Therefore, when new EEC schemes are introduced for additional commodities they have to be added to the schedule, otherwise there could be no protection for the new arrangements. This year a new scheme has been introduced by the Community for the incorporation of peas and field beans into compound animal feedingstuffs. The amending order that we are considering adds peas and field beans to the schedule of commodities, so extending the protection of the 1973 order to Community funds paid out by the intervention board under this scheme. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.33 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall divide my remarks into two parts. I hope that the Minister will not take offence at what I intend to say because, although in some respects this may appear a small matter of peas and beans, there are a number of procedural and other matters which are of consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first questions concerns the statutory instrument—1978 No. 1660—provided for the Committee, which was duplicated, and I presume that this arose from the printing difficulties we have had. I shall demonstrate that this order affects many people involved in the agricultural industry in this country, and is certainly not confined to peas and beans. Since we are the guardians of public rights in this matter, I should like to know the extent to which the order has been available and the extent to which the measures enacted therein have been advertised, particularly to those involved in trade in all the commodities in the original schedule—I shall come to that in a moment—so that they know what could occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I presume that there has been no report on this particular instrument from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. That Committee has to report to the House on any unexpected use of powers and, although it may not wish to do so in this respect, I hope that we can have some information about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Whatever knowledge hon. Members may have on the background of an order, when we come to these matters of secondary legislation, particularly statutory instruments, they must be approached from the point of view of the reasonable man— particularly where the matters raise questions of privacy and the rights of the individual. I maintain that this particular statutory instrument, rather unexpectedly, does that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the terms of the explanatory memorandum which ought to tell us what the order is all about. I do not believe that it does in the frank and fair terms I should like to see. Anyone reading the order would get some idea that it concerned entry relating to records and the production of books on demand, and that it extended the scope of the order from the existing commodities to beans and peas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order cites the order that the Minister has mentioned—the Common Agricultural Policy (Agricultural Produce) (Protection of Community Arrangements) (No. 2) Order 1973. For some reason that I cannot understand, it does not give the number of that order, which is 1973 No. 288. I maintain that it would be extremely difficult for any farmer or anyone involved in agriculture, if he did not have that order handy, to go along to his public library or his solicitor and look it up. I should like to know why the important figure of No. 288 is not there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That order was very important. It was introduced as early as 23rd February 1973 by the right hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber)—which shows the time when it was made. Of course, as it says in the preamble, it is hinged on the Agriculture Act 1967, together with the Wales order, and the European Communities Act, section 6(3) and (4). That part of the European Communities Act amended, or annulled, the existing agriculture Act and put in its place a new set of provisions from which the parent order, No. 288, sprang.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the explanatory memorandum refers to that order without the number, it does not explain that it arises directly out of the European Communities Act and the changes that that Act and the associated Act of Accession brought about in the marketing arrangements. I should have thought that, for completeness, it might have been done in the course of the explanatory memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Order No. 288 is a very important one. Under article 3 it requires the keeping and retention of records and, under article 4, the right of entry. Article 4 provided:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any authorised officer of the Board, of the Minister, or in Northern Ireland, of the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland may at all reasonable times enter upon land used for the production, storage, grading, packing, slaughter or sale of any specified commodity and may inspect and take samples of any specified commodity found upon land so used."</p></blockquote>
Article 5 gives similar powers for an authorised officer of the board or of the Minister, and so on, to
	<br><blockquote><p>"require any person engaged in the production, storage, grading, packing, slaughter or sale of any specified commodity, to produce on demand any books"</p></blockquote>
and so on and so forth. That was there, quite understandably, to protect the funds of the intervention board and to ensure that the administration of export levies was not milking public funds in an improper way. I think that we all agree that this was the right and proper sort of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the purposes of the order now before us—1978 No. 1660—which, as I said, does two things. First, it extends the powers—and I suspect this is the most important part of it, not the peas and beans, although they are significant— under article 3(1) to " persons engaged ". In other words, article 3(1), as we have been told in the explanatory memorandum, is not sufficiently wide. It is not just a matter of purchasing, selling or using any of the specified commodities. It is those who are engaged, and it covers the activities of agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the order is not required. I think that it probably is. It may well be, for reasons which we need not go into, that it should be made. It is extending the scope of these statutory powers to groups of people who were not mentioned in the original order. As I have said, I have no objection to that. It may be very necessary, but I am sorry that the emphasis on it was not made in the Minister's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the order, as I understand it, extends the schedule of the parent order from the commodities mentioned there which are beef and veal, cereals, eggs, flax and hemp, fruit and vegetables, hops, live trees, milk, oils and fats, pigmeat, poultrymeat, raw tobacco, rice, seeds, and wine to peas and beans. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
derives that from Council Regulation EEC 1119/78 passed on 22nd May this year. I want only to ask some simple questions about which I think the Minister ought to have told us. First, what was the need for extending this schedule to the commodities of peas and beans, how did it arise, and what was our view of that regulation in the Council of Ministers? Did we agree that it was necessary or wise and, if so, what advantages were seen to accrue to British farmers on the one hand and on the other to British consumers? Are there any disadvantages or advantages to either party?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice in the explanatory memorandum —I assume that it was taken from the regulation itself—that there are special measures for these commodities when used in the feeding of animals. Are we to assume that the terms of the order and the terms of the regulation from the EEC do not include these arrangements when the commodities are being grown for the feeding of human beings? As I recall, most beans in this country are almost certainly produced for cattle feed. But my recollection is that peas are largely grown, particularly in East Anglia near the deepfreezing areas, for canning or freezing. Therefore, I assume that they are not included in the order. I make no objection about that, but I think that it is important to know, because usually these crops are grown with a specific purpose in mind. Although it may sound like splitting hairs, it is important in terms of bureaucracy. If a farmer grows peas to be sent off to the canners or the freezers and he feeds the vines to cattle, does he have to produce books about what he has done with the vines if they are fed to cattle? It may be that my hon. Friend cannot go into such detail when he replies, but I thought it right to mention that rather curious point, because in years to come—one never knows —it may be that a farmer will be caught on this and will say " I was sending these peas for human consumption". "Ah", it will be said, "but you are feeding the vines to the cattle".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that some of the points that I have made appear small. However, I believe that in general we want our Ministers and the Government not only to make crystal clear the basis for the secondary legislation that they are introducing and placing before this House but
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
to give us also some of the reasons why it has been necessary, even if we do not think it necessary, and the reasons why the Council of Ministers thought it necessary to pass these regulations. I am sorry that my right hon. Friend did not take the opportunity in the age of open government to do so. I hope that what I have said and the questions that I have asked may be some small contribution in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) has made a useful contribution, and he has given me an opportunity to amplify some of the points which he raised. I said at the beginning of the Committee for the convenience of hon. Members that the order was a fairly simple one because it sought to add the word "agent" to the persons mentioned in the original order. I shall go into that in a little more detail in a moment. Secondly, I think I said that the subject of the order clearly applied to a principal in any transaction, but that experience had shown that this was not enough. It is sometimes necessary to require agents to keep the appropriate records and produce them on demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also mentioned in my opening paragraph the need to add peas and field beans to the order as well. That is a fairly simple matter but, as my hon. Friend says, there are various points which arise from it. I thought that I would weary the Committee if I went too deeply into all the aspects which might be raised. I am very pleased that my hon. Friend has touched on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will recognise that the order relates to the principle order, the Common Agricultural Policy (Agricultural Produce) (Protection of Community Arrangements) (No. 2) Order 1973 (b), to which I have just made reference and which it seeks to amend. The other point is that the order is not newly thrust on the House and the nation. The arrangements have been notified to Parliament by the usual explanatory memorandum. I would also point out—I am sure that my hon. Friend knows this, as he is both astute and conscientious in these matters—that the documents were made relevant to this year's price-fixing debate so that it was a part of the debate to include what we are doing here today. The House has had very good notice indeed and ample opportunity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
to deal with these matters. The order has been to the Scrutiny Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are merely now putting into legislative form what is already well known. As to notification to people affected by the order, I understand that the documents have been made available and that the intervention board has published leaflets dealing with the scheme, so that there is no doubt about that. The public can be aware of what is happening. I am quite sure that in any situation where there is likely to be some benefit to our people—our producers, retailers and wholesalers—they will very soon find out what aid is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important question is why we need these orders. It will be recognised all too well that substantial sums of money are paid out under the CAP and it is right that we should make appropriate arrangements to protect the funds which are available within the United Kingdom. Without the powers contained in the orders which we are discussing today, it would be impossible to check whether fraudulent claims were being made. When we have a chance to get some money from the Community, I am sure that my hon. Friend will not be at the end of the queue in pressing our claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that we use very similar powers in relation to our own deficiency payment schemes. This power is not new at all. It is merely being brought up to date. It may be noted that one of the Acts under which this amendment order and the principal order were made was the old Agriculture Act 1957, to which my hon. Friend has made reference. We are getting deeper into the roots of English agricultural history and on to firmer ground. That Act, of course, predated our entry into the Common Market by many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point I wish to make about the term "agency". The original order—the 1973 (No. 2) Order—referred to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every person who is engaged in the purchasing' selling or using of any specified commodity shall keep or cause to be kept…records"</p></blockquote>
and so on, and the words" every such person" "any person", and so on, are mentioned several times. It was felt that this definition might not include an agent who was acting between people. In the case of the fish producers' organisation, for instance, there are the people who catch the fish and the people who sell the fish, and in between there is someone
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
who conveys it and acts in the same way. He may be involved in the claims for Community funds. It is only right to say that he should be subjected to the same constraints as other people in the process. I think that my hon. Friend will accept that that is right. The phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons engaged in the selling of produce"</p></blockquote>
may be ambiguous—it can, in some circumstances, include agents and in others it may not. The amendment seeks to remove the doubt and we should welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main points with which I wish to deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He has largely dealt with my questions. Can he now go on to the main point about peas and beans? The regulation and order in effect sets up what is called a regime for peas and beans with a set price. Indeed, article 1 says that there will be a marketing year and that the price will be fixed before 1st June 1978. It sets out all the paraphernalia of the intervention system. That is also linked with the prices of soya meal. Perhaps my hon. Friend will tell us why the Council of Ministers thought it necessary to introduce this regime. There is a great deal of discussion about sheepmeat. Why was it necessary to have that regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the scheme for peas and field beans. This is a new production aid for peas and field beans used in animal feeding stuffs. That is the point of it. The aim is to enable the manufacturers to compete with imported soya meal. It will be paid to animal feed manufacturers who have made contracts to buy peas and field beans at not less than the specified minimum purchase price. Aid will be payable when the price of soya meal falls below the specified activating price and the rate of aid will be equivalent to 45 per cent, of the difference between the activating price and the soya market price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
