	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to amendment No. 2—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The room is totally unsuitable for the purposes of this Committee. This is a serious point. On a previous occasion we complained that the Committee room was too small, but I do not see why we should take up so much space on this Bill. If I am to make a vicious attack on the Government, I do not see why I should have to shout at the Minister or even the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat). Although some of us have an affection for this room, would it not be more convenient if the Committee met in a more suitable room?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon Gentleman's point, but it seems that the Scots are difficult to please. On the one hand they complain bitterly because of lack of space and now that we have adequate space they want to shift again. The acoustics of this room are sufficiently good for the Minister and Government hon Members to hear what the hon Gentleman says without his making any great endeavour. However, if the Committee presses the matter I shall raise it with the authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I apologise, Mr. Gourlay, for starting the new year with a point of order, but I require some guidance on amendment No. 1, which is not in your selection of amendments and will not, therefore, be debated. I recognise that the selection of amendments is within the Chairman's prerogative, and that no explanation need be offered, but I presume that that does not exclude the possibility of an explanation being given if the Chairman feels so inclined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled as to why the amendment has not been selected. I do not believe that it can be described as a wrecking amendment. It says that the power to alter the year of revaluation, to vary the quinquennial cycle, should remain with the Government, but that it should be a power to push the five-year date further on but not bring it nearer. In other words, the amendment is not to say that we shall have the revaluation in three years, but to leave the power to have it in, say, 7, 10, or even 304 years—whatever the Government may consider appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not, therefore, a wrecking amendment, although it is a limiting amendment. It is not, perhaps, phrased particularly happily. I can think of one or two ways in which it could be improved, but the intention
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
is clear. Perhaps you can therefore tell me, Mr. Gourlay, why it has not been called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the points put by the hon Gentleman. However, I shall act on the basis of precedent set by Mr. Speaker, in the House, and by myself as a previous Deputy Speaker. It is not my intention at any time to be tempted by the hon Gentleman to give the reasons why an amendment has not been selected. I am sorry that I cannot give him any better advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>" (3B) any order under subsection (3) above shall be made at least two clear calendar years before the commencement of the ' year of revaluation ' named in such order. ".</p></blockquote>
The clause raises important, wide-ranging issues, some of which can be raised on clause stand part. It may be—I think that I have been receiving little messages across the ether from the Minister—that the amendment was in any event unnecessary and redundant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like all the Opposition's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. If the Minister is setting out with that complacent assumption, he is in for a long, sad and disappointing series of sittings on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is the first of a large number of probing amendments to be moved by the Opposition. I make no apology for probing amendments. The Minister will accept that this is a complicated Bill, referring back to the multifarious layers of legislation on local government structure and powers that have accrued over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes difficult with the best will in the world—1 assure the Minister that the will on the Opposition side of the Committee is very good indeed— to follow the detailed intentions of the Government, or the detailed effects of general intentions which may themselves be perfectly clear. This amendment is moved against that background. Its intention is to make crystal clear that any assessor's department preparing for revaluation will be given two clear calendar years' notice of any change in the quinquennium on the year of revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason is simple. I have been advised by a number of assessors and contacts in assessor's departments over the years—I worked in local government at one time—that the quinquennium as at present envisaged involves a great deal of work for the staff of the departments. 1 am told that it is inevitably necessary to start at least two years before the date of revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the duty of the assessor to collect the rental evidence on which the new ratable values will ultimately be based. He must decide a fair and reasonable rent for commercial, industrial and domestic properties, given a balanced market. There is an enormous amount of chasing and reassessment involved in the work. It is self-evident, and, I think, not unreasonable, that we should finish one revaluation before we start the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might think that the revaluation of 1978 was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
ancient history, but the appeals date arising from that revaluation has only recently been extended—no doubt through necessity, and the ingenuity of the Minister's, and my, legal colleagues—to June 1981. Therefore, we are still tidying up the 1978 revaluation, although we are getting near to the next, which is due in 1983. This underlines the need to ensure that there can be no question of an unfortunate assessor suddenly finding that an order has been laid in Parliament to bring forward, or to vary, the date of a revaluation at very short notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter may work either way. This may be a convenient time for the Minister to clear up the point that would have been raised on amendment No. 1. It would be particularly unfortunate if suddenly the assessor were told that the revaluation was to be in one year's time. It would be equally unfortunate if he expected a revaluation in a year or nine months' time but was told that it had been postponed for three or four years. A great deal of work which might have been undertaken by the department in preparation for the revaluation would then become redundant, because the new date was so far ahead that the work would be irrelevant to the year of revaluation when it occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will accept that the loss to local authorities thus caused might be considerable. I do not have Scottish figures, but in July 1979, when the 1982 revaluation in England was cancelled, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, in reply to a written question, suggested that the loss at that stage—three years in advance of the expected date— would probably be about £5 million. I do not expect that the Under-Secretary was attempting to exaggerate the loss, as it was obviously a slight embarrassment to him that his actions had caused it. This figure illustrates that even three years before a revaluation a substantial amount of work had been undertaken and the change in the year of revaluation caused a significant loss to local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is self-evident and I do not want to labour it. The next revaluation in Scotland is expected in 1983. Assuming a run-up period of about two years, the assessors must even now be girding their loins and getting into the starting blocks, and if the clause is to be used in connection with the next revaluation—I know that the Minister will want to tell us whether that is the intention—we would have to have news, if the amendment is made, during the course of 1981. There would not, even now, be the two clear calendar years which the amendment suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to give reasonable warning of a movement either way. An advancement may not be possible, but in the case of a postponement there should be two years' reasonable notice from the original date of the quinquennium and two years' clear notice before the new date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could also say a word or two about what will happen in 1983 and whether he has any intention of upsetting the quinquennial pattern, which should make 1983 a year of revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Glasgow, Gars-cadden (Mr. Dewar) has indicated that this amendment is one of a series of probing amendments to this part of the Bill by which hon Gentlemen aim to ascertain some
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of the details of the Government's proposals in these clauses and the general matters that they cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon Gentleman clearly recognises, the amendment would impose a rigid requirement of a two-calendar-year period before any power under clause 1 could be exercised by the Secretary of State. Indeed, the use of the phrase "two clear calendar years" in the amendment suggests a period slightly longer than two years, because on the assumption that a calendar year runs from 1 January to 31 December—not an unreasonable assumption—about two years and three months' notice would in effect be required before an order could be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman's basic proposition is that if any Government intend to cancel or postpone a revaluation it is not only reasonable but eminently sensible to give clear notice of that intention, so that time, effort and resources are not wasted on a revaluation that in the end does not take place. I in no way wish to disagree with the hon Gentleman about that general principle, and I can assure him that the Government are 100 per cent, in accordance with his views on the desirability of such notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman recognised that if the Committee were to accept his amendment the practical effect would be to rule out any question of postponing the revaluation or any part of the revaluation due in 1983. He has asked me to indicate at this stage the Government's intentions in regard to that matter. I have to tell him that the Government have not yet made a decision on the question of revaluation for 1983. However, we recognise that it is necessary for us to come to a decision within the next few weeks or months, for the very reasons that the hon Gentleman has indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the period of two years which the hon Gentleman mentioned is a reasonable period for those required to undertake the work connected with a revaluation. It would therefore be the Government's intention to announce at a reasonably early stage whether there was to be a revaluation and, if so, whether it was to be a complete revaluation or only a partial one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment. It would introduce a rigidity which he himself recognised and which the Government consider to be unnecessary, for two reasons. First, the Government give an assurance that reasonable time will be given. Secondly, if there were any dispute about whether the time given was reasonable, any order under this provision will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses of Parliament there would be a full opportunity for Parliament to probe the reasonableness of the order and to vote on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, whilst I accept entirely the hon Gentleman's principal arguments about the need for reasonable forewarning to local authorities and those involved in a revaluation, I hope that he will accept that there is no need for rigidity, and that his amendment, if accepted, would rule out any possible change as regards the 1983 revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunbartonshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear how the Government view the provisions of clause 1. I understood that my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) was asking for clarification and saying that there was a need for a two-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
year period of notice, and that local government officers had difficulties because they were not certain about the time scale of revaluations. It is on that point that I press the Minister to say how this would work for the office of a regional authority charged with the responsibility of conducting the revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) is not a member of the Committee— [Hon Members: "He is."] It seems that he is a member of every Committee. In the hon Gentleman's absence I shall make my point. The hon Gentleman is fond of saying that he speaks from experience, having apparently carried out most functions in every sphere of existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to see the hon Gentleman arrive, because I greatly enjoy serving on Committees with him. I have just made the point that he often speaks from experience, which is what I want to do. Those in local government plan, organise and prepare to carry out a revaluation over a long period. The Government are fond of speaking about cuts in public expenditure. I read yesterday in the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> that Ministers see local authorities as being in the vanguard of reducing public expenditure, and think that it is there that their best opportunities lie. It should appeal to them to suggest that the planning of a revaluation is better organised on the present arrangements than to make the proposed alteration. Will the Minister explain why the Government are persuaded to make this change when patently organisation, manpower planning and everything else involved in revaluation are better structured within the present set-up than what is envisaged in clause 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that other members of the Committee will not follow the precedent set by the hon Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), who has just made a clause 1 stand part speech rather than a speech on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise to make it again at the appropriate time, Mr. Gourlay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: should regard that as tedious repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). The Minister appears to be taking on board the concern of Opposition Members. It has been clear from our discussions with assessors in local authorities that they wish to have departments running more smoothly and to ensure that they have adequate notice of any change in the quinquennial arrangements. If the Minister gives an assurance that reasonable time will be given, that there will be adequate notice, that "reasonable" means about 24 months—which could mean 27 months as a result of the amendment—and that the Government will undertake that the arrangements will not be altered, that will go some way towards clarifying that aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, local authorities are experiencing considerable difficulty, as the assessors do not form part of local government in many respects, although they
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
live under the roof of local government. Some have said that they are neither fish nor fowl. They are required to run affairs efficiently and have done so in the past. We will probably discuss that matter at greater length during the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would be grateful if both local government and the assessors could be assured that two years' notice will be given. That will have to be given quickly if the arrangements for 1983 are to be set in train. I go no further now, as I shall stray into the clause stand part debate, but the Opposition are grateful for the Minister's undertaking. I hope that in his reply he will ensure that that is known throughout the highways and byways of Scottish local government and the assessor's departments, so that their minds may be set at rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to acknowledge the points made by the hon Gentleman. The Government recognise that a period of about two years is needed for the preparatory work for revaluation. Secondly, we do not intend to put local authorities to enormous expense and effort if that is to prove unnecessary at the end of the day. We intend to explain the need for revaluation, whether whole or partial, in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, with that assurance, the Member for Garscadden will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Opposition's form of words is too inflexible. Clearly, there is unanimity on the need for proper warning, and agreement about what constitutes a reasonable length of time. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I know, Mr. Gourlay, that you have a reputation for being a strict Chairman. I have experience of your strictness, and I assure you that I do not intend to stray out of order as many of us were allowed to do on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) at first thought that the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) was not on the Committee. All Scottish Conservative Back Benchers are on every Committee. I notice that they are all distancing themselves from the Government. Perhaps they want to be nearer the door to escape, or it may be that the nearer we get to a general election the more they assert their independence and exert a little more influence over the Government than they have done up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is important as it proposes a fundamental change in the rating and revaluation structure, which is the basis of local government finance. It also adds to the number of affirmative orders needing parliamentary scrutiny. I am not making a party point. I have regularly had to defend affirmative orders as the highest and best form of parliamentary scrutiny that we have, although, as we all recognise, that is not very good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not belittle the admirable work done by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Dewar) and his colleagues in the Select Committee. However, I wish that instead of everyone fleeing to Select Committees we paid more attention to the basic bread-and-butter routine work of Parliament and provided a form of additional scrutiny for such matters as the one before us. This is a classic example of the type of measure that needs close scrutiny. Although the clause is short it is most important, and I should like to ask one or two questions about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am indebted to the Minister for distributing notes on clauses. I could never understand why a somewhat acrimonious issue was made of that practice during our sittings on a previous Bill. Notes on clauses merely tell Ministers and others what we are doing; they do not say why we are doing it. I wish to query that. Nevertheless the notes are valuable, if for no other reason than that the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reporters will find the references to previous legislation helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No reason has been given for the change being made by the clause. The Secretary of State did not refer to it in his Second Reading speech, and I doubt whether the Minister who wound up the debate referred to it either. All of the emphasis was on the housing support grant and the additional powers over the rate support grant, with which we shall be dealing in due course. Therefore, we are having to speculate why the change is considered necessary. I am sure that the Minister will take the opportunity offered by this debate to inform us. In a fairly lengthy Government statement during the Lords' debate on local government reform there was no hint that the change that we are considering had anything to do with such reform. In column 1219 of the 
	<i>Hansard</i> report of the Second Reading debate we see that the Secretary of State merely hinted in passing that clauses 1 and 2 might possibly be the basis of the forerunner of a reform of local authority finance. The Government seem unlikely to redeem at least one election pledge—to abolish rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is right, and I am grateful to him for intervening. That constitutional fact should be put on record. The Conservative Party discovered that the original commitment was silly. So much work has been done on the subject, yet I suspect that we shall be stuck with rates as the main basis of local authority income for a long while. That, of course, need not prevent the hon Gentleman and his colleagues getting the best of both worlds by hinting that the rating system could be abolished, while there is no commitment to abolish it in this parliamentary session or in any other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Gourlay, of course. I was making what I thought was a non-controversial speech. I was certainly not trying to waste time. I am genuinely grateful to the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East for refreshing my memory, I can remember in this very room the late Dick Crossman, a great reformer— I am not being in any sense cynical; he was a great reformer—saying when he was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government that he would make sure that the rates were abolished. He said that what had been wrong was that the Civil Service had not come up with the right answers because it had not been given the right questions. That was said at least 15 years ago and we still have rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of clause 1, all that I am saying is that the process of revaluation on a five-yearly cycle has not really been questioned or challenged since the last main piece of legislation on this subject in 1956. Therefore, the clause is fundamental. I am not suggesting that it is laying the basis for any great reform of local government—I do not think that it has anything to do with that. All that has happened is that the Government have been so embarrassed by the rate of inflation that not to revalue more often than every five years has become patently absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some reasons for the clause, I am sure that the Minister will tell me what they are. I am assuming either that the rate of inflation means that revaluation should be made in less than five years or that, for one reason or another, the Government think that the five-yearly cycle is a burden on local expenditure, so revaluation should be done in less than five years. I assume that either one or the other must be the reason, or both if the Government can get away with it. I do not understand why the Minister is raising his eyebrows. We have not yet been given any reason, so I am entitled to speculate on at least one or two of them. If 1 am wrong, so be it. But I suspect that I am somewhere near the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that in the past when there has been a revaluation authorities have always been tempted to raise extra expenditure deviously and to suggest that this is due to revaluation. There is nothing wrong with that. I have been party to local authority decisions where that method has been used. Nevertheless, 1 hope that it has nothing to do with this change, because in the present economic climate it would be wrong for the Government to use this legislation as a way of manipulating public expenditure. I hope that the Minister can disabuse my mind on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument, which I am not sure I ever fully understand, is that a revaluation always benefits the domestic ratepayer. In other words, because of the concessions given to the domestic ratepayer, if there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
an overall percentage increase in valuation in any rating authority—even of, say, 20 per cent.—the rate of increase for the domestic ratepayer is usually less than it might be for the commercial or industrial ratepayer. I am not sure whether 1 am right on that point, but we have not yet had an explanation of the real reason for the clause. I am not really complaining; it may sound as if I am, but that is just normal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must take on board that few Opposition Members, including members of the Committee, raised this question on Second Reading, because we were more concerned about the two more fundamental questions in the political sense. Nevertheless, this is an important question. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will respond by giving us, for the first time, specific reasons why this fundamental change is being made— albeit with a parliamentary safeguard, which in my opinion is totally inadequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient if I add a few questions to those of my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), and raise some issues to which the Minister may wish to make a preliminary reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a major debate. Other clauses in part I will, 1 believe, go through quickly, because they are non-controversial. But, as my hon Friend said, we are entitled to an adequate explanation of why such powers are being sought at all. Very little was said about them on Second Reading, and five-year revaluations are strongly favoured. If the Minister is adequately to explain why clause 1 should stand part of the Bill, he must rebut that presumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need hardly remind the Committee that the Scottish record is admirable. Revaluations took place in 1961, 1966 and 1971, although there was then a hiccup because the revaluation that should have occurred in 1976 was postponed to 1978. However, the reasons for that were exceptional—local government reorganisation. But, that special circumstance apart, Scotland has kept strictly to the envisaged programme. The contrast with England is sharp. After a revaluation in 1963, England struggled to a second in 1973, and the third— due in 1982—has been already jettisoned by Ministers south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case for keeping to the quinquennial pattern. The Secretary of State for Scotland recognised that on Second Reading, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" There is of course a strong case for regular revaluations of property to ensure a fair distribution of the rate burden."— 
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1219.]</p></blockquote>
Few of us would quarrel with that statement. Therefore, if that strong case exists, it is clear that, by bringing forward the clause, the Minister has seen positive reasons for departing from that presumption. The circumstances must be more than exceptional. If they were merely exceptional, he could have achieved his purpose by primary legislation, as happened during the local government reorganisation, in section 117 of the 1973 Act. That was a fair approach in those exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may propose that the matter goes to an order which needs an affirmative resolution of the House. I agree with my hon Friend's remarks about the reason for scepticism as to whether this is a meaningful check and review. Earlier, the Minister made references to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
this being a safeguard, but we all live in the real world and know that if the Government put down an order and whip it—particularly if they whip it on a United Kingdom basis—the idea that we could turn it back because of genuine discontent and disquiet among, say, local government officials or even a cross-party selection of Back Benchers is very slim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This piece of machinery will allow the Government to disrupt the existing and well-established pattern of quinquennial revaluations with less trouble. A strong case must be put forward if we are to allow this type of machinery to stay in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon Friend, I have been speculating about that case and I believe that three possible reasons are involved. I do not like most of them, but at least they can be argued, and I want to know which one of them, or which combination, is in the Minister's mind, so that we know whether we can afford to give a fair wind to the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason, quite simply, is one of expediency. It may be that keeping to the five-year revaluation cycle is administratively inconvenient and difficult, that assessor's departments just cannot deal with it and that the whole of the mechanics of the system are creaking. I believe that it is under strain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate I referred to the fact that right up to June 1981 we shall still be dealing with appeals from the 1978 revaluation. That shows what a cumbersome process it is and to what extent it needs streamlining. But I believe that, however difficult it may be to keep to the quinquennium, the consequences of departing from it are prima facie considerably more serious, because they are that the whole system of valuation gets out of phase and we have very serious distortions in the way in which the rate burden is levied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Revaluations have a considerable impact upon the share of the rate burden that is borne by the various sectors of property, if I may so put it. In a written answer to me on 19 December the Secretary of State said that the result of the revaluation of 1978 was an increase in rateable value for domestic properties of 174 per cent., for industrial properties of 300 per cent, and for commercial properties of 258 per cent. Interestingly, those increases were unusually large because we had a gap that was two years longer—a seven-year gap rather than a five-year gap. If we return to earlier revaluations—for example, that of 1971— we find that the relative figures for domestic properties were 87 per cent., for industrial properties 63 per cent, and for commercial properties 67 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that if we let the gap widen we shall have the sort of results we had in 1978, when there was a very much larger increase on industrial properties than on domestic properties. There is one of the answers to the well-founded impression that at least the last revaluation was of assistance to domestic ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that sort of change and shift of emphasis was justified by events, it was because of the lengthy gap between revaluations. It cannot have been a good thing that the system had got so far out of sync. It seems that if we are to have the clause in the Bill, with the presupposition that, quite frequently, we may have moves in the quinquennium, the danger that it will get out of phase is that much greater. 1 do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
anticipate any circumstances in which the revaluation will be moved to three years as against five years. I believe that the revaluations will be shoved out and that the periods will tend to become longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may clarify that point, because it is of importance. The effect of the clauses would be to enable the Secretary of State to postpone a date of revaluation, but he could do so only by naming an alternative date. Once that had been named the subsequent revaluation would still have to be five years after that. There is nothing in the Bill which alters the five-year period between revaluations unless, obviously, there is a subsequent order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for making that point. In other words, the gap cannot be closed, but only widened. My point about the distortions that may result is well made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go on at length about that point, because I am sure that it has been taken by the Minister, but I should like to present him with a consequence with which he will be very familiar—the impact over recent years of the domestic element in the rate support grant. I take the figures for 1980-81, because I have not made the calculations on the present round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England the domestic element is 8.75 per cent. of the total settlement. In Scotland it is now down to 1.09 per cent. That is because in the last revaluation we were able to help the domestic ratepayer. Not so long ago the domestic element was 31p. It has now dropped to 3p, because we have been able to keep to regular revaluations, despite that one hiccup which brought in the distortion, which we have eliminated. However, if we postpone the 1983 revaluation—that is clearly in the Minister's mind, because he said that a decision would be taken in the next few weeks or months—the sort of distortion that led to a 31p domestic element will creep in again, and the strain imposed upon an already unpopular system will be very large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other general point about the rating system, which I think is agreed by all those who examine it, is that one of its disadvantages is that it lacks buoyancy as a method of raising revenue for local government. This point was argued strongly in the Layfield report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not have revaluation, the system will be totally inelastic, with no buoyancy at all. It is only at revaluation that one can catch up, and build in an escalator. The only ways to achieve growth in revenue will be changes in rate poundage—not necessarily the best way—improvements in property, or new build. That would be the unfortunate consequence of extending, for expediency, the length of time between revaluations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of technical points to back up this argument. My hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) may want to mention one or two of them as they have occurred in his part of the world. There are circumstances in which a revaluation is made on the basis of the certainty of a quinquennial revaluation. For example, the fact that there will be a revaluation in five years has a substantial effect on the valuation placed upon mineral extraction workings. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
revaluation is then postponed for 7, 8 or 10 years, and if the rate of extraction varies greatly, there is no way of adjusting the rateable value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Claybank mineral case, of which I do not pretend to understand the intricacies, has proved that between quinquennial revaluations it is not possible to adjust rateable values to meet such circumstances. Those who have earned their pennies in valuation matters—as has, I think, at least one advocate on the Conservative Benches—will have more experience than I have of the inflexibilities that result from this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A final reason for looking carefully at this clause is that if we are to have about 10 years between revaluations social conditions clearly demand that the market economy, in which Government Members believe, shall have its effect on rental values. An area might be particularly depressed and deprived in 1983, but improvers could move in. There could be a social migration. For example, a rezoning under the Education Act might give the area a good school and force up property prices. If it is 10 years before the next revaluation, the fair market rental would certainly put rateable values up substantially, but if there is no machinery to do so between revaluations, the inhabitants get off with extremely good buys at the expense of other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading anger was expressed by hon Members from, I think, Argyll and Ayrshire about the effects of the last revaluation. I can understand that anger, but the reason for it was that there had been between 1971 and 1978 an unusually long gap and the change and the adjustment was peculiarly cruel to those who were out of line with current rental values. If we accept this clause, and therefore envisage that there will be a tendency to postpone revaluations for temporary expediency, because the mechanics of the system make it difficult to take the strain, we shall run into the difficulties which I have been outlining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen with interest to hear whether that is the reason why we are being asked to include the clause in the Bill. The Committee will have gathered that I find it a little unconvincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second potential reason which might lead people to think that there ought to be a postponement is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend satisfied that the Government are not taking powers to bring forward revaluation? The Minister made a point about carrying on for five years from a certain year. Is the Bill worded in such a way that there are no circumstances in which, even with the necessary parliamentary affirmation, the Government could bring forward the year of revaluation? I can see some merit in having such flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was obviously in some doubt on that point—hence the tabling of amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been given assurances by the Minister. I am relying not only on those but on his briefing, which presumably is considered. I shall certainly have another look at this matter. I cannot give a final view, but I share my hon Friend's doubts, or I would not have drafted amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to my second possible reason, also mentioned by my hon Friend, which must be given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
serious consideration. It is that this is a paving clause to reform, that it is necessary because there is a need for flexibility in the mechanism, and that at some point in this part of the Bill we may be seeing a fundamental reform of the rating system, which is a big subject. I again draw the Committee's attention to the useful column 1219 of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of the Second Reading debate. The Secretary of State said of the valuation and rating clauses in Part I:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Manifestly they do not amount to the thoroughgoing reform of the rating system which I know some hon Members would like to see, and which remains one of our long-term objectives. The Bill is not concerned with fundamental changes in the system of local government finance but with improvements … The powers conferred by clauses 1 and 2 might be required as a preliminary to more extensive reforms … Clearly there is no point in revaluing property if shortly thereafter rates are no longer payable on it, and it therefore seems sensible to introduce some flexibility into the arrangements for revaluations." —
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1219.]</p></blockquote>
As an ordinary man looking at an ordinary piece of English, I can deduce from that only that the Secretary of State had in mind that in about 1984 or 1985 domestic payment of rates would be abolished, or perhaps the whole rating system would be abolished. In those circumstances they need this clause in order to postpone a revaluation that would be a total waste of money. That was clearly in the Secretary of State's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was rebutted to some extent by the cold realism of the Under-Secretary of State. But I found his rebuttal somewhat unsatisfactory, because he told the hon Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram):
	<br><blockquote><p>" But I say to my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South that when he says that he supports a local income tax I am not sure whether he has considered whether he would really wish the local authority to which he has devoted his remarks to have control over the level of tax that he would pay on that basis."— 
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1329-30.]</p></blockquote>
That is not what one might call an argument of principle, the root and branch dismissal of the principle of rating reform or the introduction of a local income tax. It was merely another aspect of the obsession and the argument "ad authority", so to speak, which at present bedevils all discussion of local authority structure and finance in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not seem to me to suggest that the Under-Secretary was ruling out the possibility of rating reform at some future date. The Second Reading debate was splattered with pathetic cries of "There must be a better way" from Conservative Back Benchers. Therefore, given the fact that this was adduced as practically the only reason by the Secretary of State for introducing this clause, we are entitled to ask where the Scottish Ministers stand on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Provan referred to pledges on rating reform and abolition of local rates. I do not want to delay the Committee with history, but it is worth reminding hon Members that since 1974 there have been at least nods towards the possibility of rating reform from the Conservative Party. In 1974 it was more than a nod. I quote from a press release in October 1974, giving an extract from a speech by the present Prime Minister, who is coyly described in it as the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Conservative candidate for Finchley and Conservative Spokesman on the Environment."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The right hon Lady said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have decided to take the historic step to abolish the present rating system over a five year Parliament."</p></blockquote>
Nothing could be more categoric than that. The electorate did not allow it in that Parliament, but the right hon Lady is now in a better position to put that promise into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1977 we were told that there were some divisions among local government Tory leaders, but the present Secretary of State for the Environment then gave a pledge—and who am I to undervalue his pledges? In 1979 the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> admitted that there was Tory indecision and the present Secretary of State for the Environment was saying "We may have to wait". In the 1979 Conservative manifesto we were told not that the Conservative Party was abolishing the pledge about the abolition of domestic rates but that it would have to take second place to the more important priority of cutting income tax. I do not know whether the Government have finished with cutting income tax—we have not noticed very much as a result of their efforts—but it would appear that in the long term we are still committed to rating reform. Indeed, that very phrase was used by the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment in March 1980, and in July we were told by the Secretary of State for the Environment:
	<br><blockquote><p>" We have begun working on the alternative to the present system."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 30 July 1980; Vol. 989, c. 1501.]</p></blockquote>
There is dynamic action—five years after Layfield. We are glad to know that there is work on the system, and we now know from the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) that discussions are going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, at the end of the day, despite this long and perhaps rather irregular history, there has been a continuing commitment, at least in the long term, to the abolition of domestic rates and possibly to even more fundamental rating reform. We have the clause being introduced, we have had the Delphic references from the Secretary of State that it is a paving amendment to that sort of change and reform, and if that is what lies behind it we are entitled to know so that we may consider whether we want to give it our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us have been much involved over the years in the arguments about Layfield and the idea that there should be a local income tax perhaps running in tandem with some vestiges of the local rating system. Others have favoured a sales tax, some have talked about a poll tax, some have merely wanted the exclusion of domestic property rating and the rest to remain, and some have suggested that there should merely be a change from rental values to capital values in the rating of domestic property. There are endless variations, but we are at least entitled to know in general principle, if not in detail, whether it is now in the mind of the Secretary of State to introduce rating reform in Scotland and whether that is the justification for this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and final reason which may be behind this change, which we should like to have sorted out in order to give it priority or to reject it, is one I almost blush to mention because it may sound terribly cynical or perhaps unfair. I blush to mention it in the face of so many hon Gentlemen of independent stature in the Committee. However, very few of them are actually in the Government, so I belive it has to be given a run, if only to elicit the comments of the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The next revaluation is in 1983. It may be—I put it no higher than that—that the Government will manage to stagger to 1983 before we have a general election. The Under-Secretary pulls a face, but we live in a real world and I cannot help but think that the possible reason for this machinery is that we may have the unfortunate chance that the parliamentary quinquennium will come up at the same time as the revaluation and that, all too solidly, there will thud through the letter box the new ratable value, perchance on the same day as the local Conservative candidate's manifesto. That would be a very unfortunate juxtaposition of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However much one sophisticates or tries to explain that it is the rate poundage that matters and the ratable value is only a marginal adjustment of emphasis within the system, people are likely to be panicked if they find an increase of 200 per cent, in their ratable value just before the next general election. The ones who will be panicked will be those owner-occupiers who are already more than panicked and pretty disgusted by the Government's record in this area, by mortgage interest levels and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I put to the Under-Secretary that that would be an unworthy but, I fear, a real and plausible factor in the mind of Conservative planners which may well explain why we are now faced with clause 1. I ask for a straightforward response of those three issues and the others which my hon Friends will bring up. I want to know whether it is expediency in terms of the mechanics of the system—despite the distortions to which that will lead, which I have mentioned— whether it is a genuine paving amendment to try to enable us to go down the path of rating reform, or whether it is electoral convenience, a desperate attempt to ensure that at least one of the many disadvantages that Conservatives will no doubt have to face, if it is 1983, can be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to know the reason or combination of reasons, or whether there are other reasons that have not yet occurred to me, justifying this machinery which would allow the pushing back of the revaluation. The only other explanation that has been offered to me is that the measure is just bringing us into line with England—that it is a power similar to that which appears in section 23 of the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980. But I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State would not argue that we should simply follow the English example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to know, because so far as I know there has been no enthusiasm at all for this measure. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, at its meeting on 18 April 1980 and again on 20 June 1980, advised against the clause. I do not suggest that this is something about which the local authorities are very angry, although there are many other parts of the Bill about which they are indeed angry, but they have specifically, as a group, come to the conclusion that there is no case for this measure. They cannot understand the justification for it, and they have twice advised the Secretary of State to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fact underlines the need for an explanation, which has not as yet been offered and without which my hon Friends and I cannot make up our minds whether we should support the clause. If the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
offers us a fairly full explanation of the thinking behind it, we may be able to decide whether to attempt to remove it from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ayrshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slow to rise because I thought that there would be a huge rush of hon Members wanting to discuss this clause. First, I should explain that the absence of my name from the list of distinguished Members who support amendment No. 2 must not be taken to be in any way significant. I must confess that I received a letter from the hon Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel), but I understand that about 420 other hon Members did too, so there is absolutely nothing significant in that. I wholeheartedly support the amendment put forward by my colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great doubts about what the Under-Secretary of State and the Government are suggesting in clause 1. The Under-Secretary may have an aversion to five-year plans, and this is one introduced by a Labour Government in 1975. Following the visit of my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Brown) to Afghanistan, the Under-Secretary may be even more averse to anything smacking of any regime that is less than fully democratic. But 1 must point out that the quinquennial procedure was first introduced not in 1975 but in 1956 at a time when the country was safe from the Left-wing influence to which the Under-Secretary may think it was subject in 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am opposed to clause 1 also because it is one of the clumsiest clauses I have ever seen. The wording itself is clumsy enough. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), who is greatly experienced in this field and who has been a distinguished Minister with responsibility for local government, finds difficulty in interpreting this provision and deciding whether it means that the period can be reduced to three years. I still believe that that is a possible legal interpretation. I am no lawyer, but it seems to me perfectly possible that, in terms of strict legal interpretation, it could mean a reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister does not want the clause to bear that interpretation, not because it cannot do so but because it would be impracticable in real terms— on the grounds, in terms of operations with the assessor, with local government and so on. It is just not possible. It seems to be possible de jure, if that is the right phrase, but it is not possible de facto. Is that right? My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who is a lawyer of some distinction—I must get the nuances right—says that that is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still some doubt about the interpretation, and it is clumsy wording. It is clumsy in another way also, and I ask the Minister to consider this seriously. It is strange that, if it is accepted, we shall have a power given by clause 1 interposed into a general interpretation section of the 1975 Act. Is that legally correct? I presume that the draftsmen have looked at it and believe it to be correct, but it seems clumsy. If there is doubt, it should be examined on the basis not of law but of logic, which I prefer. It seems strange to have a power given to the Secretary of State included in a clause interpreting various words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued—and I shall so argue—that if the power to change the interpretation is included, it could mean that the Secretary of State could by order under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
subsection (3) change the year 1978-79. However much I might like 1979 to be changed or perhaps expunged from the record in some contexts—or however much I might dislike the idea of 1978-79 being expunged—it is a clumsy way to deal with this matter. There should be some other way. I shall come to the merits of the case in a few moments. If the Government are seeking to give the Secretary of State power, it seems a clumsy way to do it, and I hope that it will be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the substance of the matter. I, like my hon Friends the Members for Provan and for Garscadden, tried to delve into the mind of the Secretary of State—which is not easy—and that of the Under-Secretary of State to see in what circumstances this power might be used. I tried to envisage the circumstances in which the Secretary of State, sitting in New St. Andrew's House, might consider extending the period of revaluation.

I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will give specific examples—not just the general phrases hinted at on Second Reading. Let us assume the unlikely situation that the Government continue in office and— perhaps less unlikely—the Under-Secretary of State becomes Secretary of State, sitting at his desk in New St. Andrew's House. Will he give specific concrete examples that the ordinary layman can understand-not clouded in legal phraseology, generalities and the kind of phrase we so often hear in these discussions— of the circumstances where he would say that the revaluation should be postponed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as generous as my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden is. I did not think of three reasons. Perhaps that is because I am not as inventive as my hon Friend. I did not come up with the reason of expediency, although I think he put forward a sensible explanation of why that might be so. I did not imagine that the Secretary of State envisaged that it might be a preliminary to reform. I came up with the clear impression that it was political gerrymandering. The Under-Secretary of State can blow hot or blow cold if he likes, but I came to the view that the one concrete instance in which I could imagine the Secretary of State saying "We shall postpone the revaluation " would be that a general election was imminent and he was worried about what the effect might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may pooh-pooh the idea, but the issue is highly contentious. My hon Friend the Member for Garscadden referred to the cases in Argyll and Ayrshire. Interestingly, those in Ayrshire were primarily in the seat of the current Secretary of State for Scotland. Certain residential properties in Ayr and Troon and in the constituency of my hon Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Lambie) were substantially revalued—by 300 per cent, or more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the matter was highly contentious. The present Secretary of State was one of those most worried about the effect of revaluation—not just in terms of people's pockets but about the political effect, which was substantial. I remind the Committee—I would not have to remind the right hon Gentleman if he were here —that the Secretary of State has one of the slimmest majorities in Scotland. His is one of the most unsafe seats. He is very worried about his political future, and rightly so. I detect in the town of Ayr a groundswell of opinion against—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member suggests that the Secretary of State has a slim majority. But in the 1966 general election, when the present Secretary of State for Scotland fought the present leader of Strathclyde regional council, he won with a considerable majority. Indeed, the majority was enhanced, and that will certainly happen again at the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) seems to have a great facility for drawing red herrings across the debate. 1 hope that we can return to clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The red herring allows me to remind the Committee that while the present Secretary of State was doing relatively well in Ayr, the present Member for Aberdeenshire, East did very badly in Kilmarnock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was the only Tory in Scotland at that election to increase the Conservative vote and reduce the Labour majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Ayr, I can claim to be close to people's opinions. It may well be that the previous candidates to whom the hon Gentleman referred will be in the running again, to show the Secretary of State the effect of the unemployment that he and his Government are making people suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before being interrupted by the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East, I was arguing that the question of revaluation and its date and effect are highly contentious. There are enough arbitrary powers in the Secretary of State's hands. For example, there is his control over what will be suggested in respect of boundary changes, which will have a substantial political effect. There is also the Prime Minister's power to decide the date of the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it wrong to give the Secretary of State yet another arbitrary power, though admittedly subject to approval on a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. In view of the Government's majority in both Houses, that is a mere formality. The Secretary of State would be able to adjust, to manipulate and to gerrymander the position to make less unlikely the re-election of this unpopular Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, for the reasons adduced by my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden, and the one which I have added, I hope that the Committee will reject clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always enjoy listening to the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
that he preferred logic to law. I recall someone suggesting that logic is the art of going wrong with confidence, and the hon Gentleman has again justified that observation because his comments on the drafting of the clause are not of the sort to give the Committee any real concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon Gentleman and his hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) made an ungracious and unjustifiable suggestion that the reasons for clause 1 are of a political nature. I respond more in sorrow than in anger and would rebuke them, apart from anything else, for their lack of elementary arithmetic. They seem to have concluded that the date of the next general election must necessarily fall in 1983. I remind them that we have quinquennial Parliaments and, as the Government were elected in 1979, that would take us to 1984. I have no reason to believe that the next general election will be any earlier than 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, the whole basis of the rather absurd suggestion made by hon Gentlemen about the reason for the clause was unsubstantiated by previous experience. As the hon Member for Garscadden admits, the last revaluation benefited domestic ratepayers. Therefore, if there were to be any political effect in Scotland overall, that would be an argument for having revaluation and not for not doing so, unless the hon Gentleman has some reason to assume that it will be different next time and that it will not be the domestic ratepayer who will benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will accept that there is no way, I hope, that he can predict the result of the revaluation. It may go strongly against the domestic ratepayer, and the fact that there was a large swing in his favour at the last revaluation suggests that there may be a compensatory swing of the pendulum at the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ratepayer, whose feelings we are discussing, will be looking at a revaluation notice on his house alone and will not have comparative information about the placing within the total rates figure. Therefore, he will merely see a substantial increase in the valuation for his house, and I think that it would be difficult to persuade him that, although his rates have increased by 200 per cent., it is all right because certain other categories have risen by 240 per cent. I think that that would be little consolation to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is incorrect. If he recollects the last occasion when, as he says, there was much concern when the letter first appeared through the letter box, it was soon made clear that people need not draw any conclusion about their actual rate burden on the basis of a change in valuation. The only areas where there has been serious controversy as a result of the revaluation have been those where domestic ratepayers have lost out in relative terms. Unless we are talking of a general election actually on the same day as the notice of revaluation drops through the letter box, it is absurd to argue that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon Gentleman has acknowledged, at this stage no one has the faintest idea of the effect of the next revaluation on domestic ratepayers. I am sure that it is not a matter of dispute that there is no way of,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
knowing whether it will benefit the domestic ratepayer or be against his interests. On the experience of the last occasion, to suggest that that would have had any significant political effect is so absurd and devoid of any scientific or statistical evidence—or even pollster evidence, however doubtful that might be—that it deserves no further comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the more serious question raised by the hon Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), who requested an explanation of the Government's thinking behind the clause, as did the hon Member for Garscadden in his more constructive comments. I shall first deal with one more technical point before turning to the background to the clause. The hon Members for Provan and for South Ayrshire asked specifically whether the wording of the clause would enable the Government, if they so chose, to bring a revaluation forward rather than put one back. Technically, I believe, the wording of the clause makes that possible, as it refers only to the date of revaluation. In theory, immediately after a revaluation a Secretary of State could bring forward an order saying that the next would be in two rather than five years' time. Technically, there is nothing to prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government have no intention of using the power in that way. As I said to the hon Member for Garscadden, once the Secretary of State, with the approval of Parliament, has fixed a new date for revaluation, the next revaluation has to be at least five years later. The five-year period would not be affected unless there were a subsequent order, which would have to be approved by Parliament. I hope that it is now clear that the Bill does not alter the basic structure of quinquennial reviews of valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially, there are two reasons why the Government feel that clauses 1 and 2 are sensible and appropriate. The first is to avoid the need for primary legislation should circumstances arise which make desirable a change in the date of revaluation. That has already happened once when, as a result of the reorganisation of local government, the previous Government considered it appropriate to postpone until 1978 the revaluation that would otherwise have taken place in 1976. Primary legislation was required for that, although there happened to be a convenient Bill in which to insert the provision. It seems unnecessarily strict and rigid to require primary legislation for what may be, as it was on that occasion, a technical matter. It was generally agreed that local government reorganisation made in 1976 an inappropriate year for a revaluation. That is exactly the sort of circumstance in which an affirmative order submitted to Parliament would be an appropriate and sensible way of changing the date of revaluati.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one example, and I concede that it is a logical example, but, surely, the Under-Secretary does not envisage any major reorganisation of local government in the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply say that any number of reasons could arise for postponing the date of revaluation—not necessarily by years; circumstances could justify the date being changed by six months, by one year or by two. I see no argument necessitating primary legislation for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
We are not talking about a fundamental issue of tremendous importance to the nation, about the rights of individuals or anything like that. We are talking about a technical matter—the date of a revaluation of property. Quite properly, such a matter has to be submitted to Parliament. However, it seems perfectly sensible not to require the full panoply of a Bill, which would have to go through all the stages and satisfy all the requirements of full primary legislation. An order therefore seems more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pressed for concrete examples but the only example given so far has been a reorganisation of local government. In that event primary legislation would be required anyway, and revaluation could be dealt with there. Can the Under-Secretary give us one example, other than a reorganisation of local government, of an occasion when he envisages the power being used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give such examples in my subsequent remarks; they are part of my argument. Many hon Gentlemen have assumed that in practice we are concerned only with the revaluation due in 1983. If we were talking simply about the next revaluation it would have been easy for the Government to use this Bill to postpone, either indefinitely or until a specific date, the 1983 revaluation. There would have been no need to change the system. However, we genuinely believe that the existing system is unnecessarily rigid and that there is a powerful argument for the more flexible system using orders rather than full primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A separate issue—equally valid and equally relevant to the questions that I have been asked—is that at present there has to be either a full revaluation or none. There is no provision for a partial revaluation. I know that that is mentioned more specifically in clause 2, but it is relevant here because the two clauses are interlinked. They are essentially about the same matter, and I repeat that it would be highly undesirable if, for good reason, a partial revaluation were thought appropriate and primary legislation became necessary. The point about the order permitted under clause 1 is that it allows a delay in relation to both full and partial revaluations because certain categories of property can be classified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister realises that he is creating alarm, despondency and fear in the mind of every ratepayer. He has said that there is no intention to bring forward the revaluation date. He now says that powers are being sought to undertake possible partial revaluation. That is even more worrying. I know that he will come to the substance of his argument, and I hope that he will spend some time on it, because he has not so far given us a single reason other than the academic theoretical one about the need for flexibility. He has given no substance about the Government's underlying reason in relation to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman intervenes during my remarks, he cannot blame me if I have not concluded the points that I wish to make in response to the questions that he has raised. He will be able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
speak again when I have finished if he feels that my comments are inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were simply concerned with the 1983 revaluation, they could have used the Bill to announce a change—if there was to be a change—in the date of that revaluation. But, because we genuinely believe that the whole system is unnecessarily rigid in requiring primary legislation to postpone either a full or a partial revaluation, we believe that an affirmative order is far more sensible and flexible and does not deny any legitimate interest the requirement that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although COSLA has said that it would like the 1983 revaluation to take place, the authorities have not, so far as I am aware, shown any concern about the replacement of primary legislation by an order when determining how a change should be effected if a change is thought to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the more general point raised by the hon Member for Provan. He is correct in his assumption that there are reasons of policy, not simply relating to the mechanics of revaluation, which the Government regard as relevant here. Reference has been made to the Government's general position on domestic rates. In our 1979 manifesto we said that the abolition of domestic rates is for the longer term, but priority has to be given to reducing the burden of income tax in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a comment on the position at the time of the general election. The Government feel that, at a time when the whole future of domestic rates has not yet been resolved, either in terms of principle or of timing, it is sensible to have available a means to postpone revaluation if that is thought appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Secretary of State will soon have to consider whether it will be sensible to proceed with the 1983 revaluation in relation to domestic property. That matter will be announced when a decision has been reached. However, if there were a possibility in the foreseeable future that domestic rates could be abolished, it would seem sensible that some means should be available to ensure in a sensible, flexible and economic way the postponment of a revaluation which might prove to be unnecessary of wasteful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get the Minister's remarks absolutely clear. As I understand it, the Scottish Office is actively considering—the result will be announced within weeks or months—whether the 1983 revaluation should go ahead. The explanation is that the Scottish Office thinking about the possibility of abolishing the domestic rate paying system is so far advanced that it might be necessary to postpone the revaluation to make way for that reform. That is the basis of the present dispute or discussion about whether the 1983 revaluation should take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not what I said. I shall try to outline the position more clearly for the hon Gentleman. First, I said that the Government believes that the clause is desirable because it makes the whole system of determining the date of revaluation more flexible so that, if change for any reason is required, it can be done without the need for primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, on the issue of domestic rates, the Government have indicated in the past that there is an internal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Government review—not just within the Scottish Office, but including it—which is considering the whole question of the rating system, and domestic rates in particular. It seems sensible that any decision whether there should be a revaluation in 1983 should be determined in the light of our 1979 election manifesto commitment and the internal Government review currently taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister then say whether there is any other argument for postponing the 1983 revaluation apart from the looming imminence, we now gather, of a decision on domestic ratepaying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to ask the hon Gentleman to await the Secretary of State's decision on whether the 1983 revaluation should be postponed. The Committee is not being asked to consider whether there should be a 1983 revaluation. Nothing that the Committee agrees to on this Bill will determine whether there is to be a 1983 revaluation. Revaluation is a separate issue and once the Secretary of State has made his decision he will explain it to the House and will answer questions on it at that stage. But at present the issue is hypothetical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speculate on what might be the reasons for any decision that the Secretary of State ultimately reaches. When the Secretary of State is in a position to give a decision, that will be the time to give the reason for it, and the House, if it disagrees with his conclusions, will be able to act accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to embarrass the Minister, but I hope that he will read what he has said. If I understand him correctly, he said that the Government are now considering their election manifesto commitments—the 1974 one or the more recent 1979 manifesto. He said—I noted his words—that the abolition of rates was for the longer term. He is now talking only about domestic rates. That is the worrying aspect. I do not wish to be too suspicious, but is that all that is under consideration, or is it the total review of rates, including commercial and all other interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative Party manifesto of 1979 refers to domestic rates. It states that the abolition of domestic rates is a Government commitment for the longer term but priority has to be given to reducing the burden of income tax. The longer term means that it will certainly not be possible within this present Parliament. In talking about the next revaluation, we are referring to a revaluation which would begin, according to the hon Gentleman's hon Friend, when the next general election is due and would have considerable significance in regard to any change in the domestic rating system that might be made in the next Parliament, Whether there is any change in the domestic rating system, and whether it takes place towards the end of this Parliament or some time in the next Parliament, does not matter. It is still equally relevant to the question whether it might be sensible to have a 1983 revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am possibly being thick now, and I could not understand whether the hon Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) was agreeing with me or not. I cannot see a reform of the rating system, never mind the abolition of it, without it applying to all ratepayers—commercial, industrial and domestic. I want clarification. What is the intention of the Conservative Party? What are the Government playing around with at the moment in the discussions that are apparently in hand? We are entitled to an answer. The Minister has raised doubts in the mind of everyone in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon Gentleman is seeking conclusions where no conclusions have yet been reached. Therefore, I am not in a position to say what they are or what they might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said—it is as far as I can reasonably be asked to go—that our election manifesto referred specifically to an intention at some future date to abolish the domestic rating system. I referred specifically to the domestic rating system. I said, as has been said by previous Ministers in both the Scottish Office and the Department of the Environment, that an internal review of the rating system is going on. That is the correct position at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep interrupting, but I am sure that the Under-Secretary accepts that this is a subject of some fascination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly not press the hon Gentleman to reveal conclusions that have not been reached. I have great respect for his ability, but I do not expect him to do that. Nor shall I embarrass him by asking him to repeat in any detail the considerations involved. However, is he saying that the 1983 revaluation is under active reconsideration, with the possibility of being postponed? Is one of the issues being considered the possible reform of the domestic element of the rating system? If that is so, are there any other considerations which might lead to the postponement of this revaluation, or is it merely that particular round of discussions which is in issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) very reasonably suggested the construction of a model in which the Minister might suggest the kinds of issues which would lead to the postponement of a revaluation. We do not need to construct a model: the debate is going on now. We know one issue, which the Minister has been good enough to give us. I want to establish whether that is the only issue, because if it is, it tells us much, by inference, about the type or possible timing of changes in the rating system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to mislead the hon Gentleman or his hon Friends. They will wish to draw conclusions from what I say. I must say, without qualification, that no conclusions have yet been reached on the question of timing of the abolition of the domestic rating system. I ask hon Gentlemen not to draw any conclusions to the contrary, because I can assure them that they would be unsubstantiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the information that the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) was seeking, because the conclusions have not been reached. Therefore, it is not a question of not being willing to give them, as there are no decisions to be communicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On revaluation, I am willing to say that a major
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
factor that the Secretary of State will have to take into account in determining whether there is to be a 1983 revaluation will be the likelihood of any abolition of the domestic rating system, or of any fundamental change in the rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government and, I am sure, the Committee as a whole are concerned about is that there should not be a substantial amount of effort, time and expense going into a revaluation that may prove to be unnecessary or largely abortive because of either simultaneous events or events that take place a short time thereafter. That has to be taken into account, and these are the considerations which the Secretary of State will have to bear in mind when he reaches his decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stewart: 1 accept my hon Friend's explanation of the clause, although one must worry about his first argument that moving from primary legislation to affirmative order makes life more convenient for the Government. I am sure that that is so, but the function of the House of Commons is not in principle to make life more convenient for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to what my hon Friend said about the position on the reform of domestic rates, because that seems to be a central issue. I would be exceedingly concerned if what he is saying meant that the Government were moving towards the abolition of domestic rates while leaving the system for industry and commerce unchanged. That would have a number of exceedingly undesirable consequences, certainly for local authorities, as some would presumably have no local base of taxation, whereas others would have a substantial base of taxation, and for industry and commerce because they are not directly represented through the electoral system. There would obviously be a temptation for authorities to pile expenditure on the very narrow base of a rating system which was limited to industry and commerce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon Friend will have an opportunity to sum up again on points made by hon Members. I ask him to be more precise about what the internal review is doing. Is it limited to the domestic rating system or does it include the rating system as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure my hon Friend. I referred specifically to the domestic ratepayer because that was the only element referred to in our election manifesto, but the current internal review is of the rating system as a whole, including industrial and commercial rating. I can assure my hon Friend that Ministers are very conscious of the strength of the arguments he has just mentioned as to the possible effects of a partial repeal of the rating system on certain classes of ratepayer. That factor is certainly being taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: (Fife, Central): I hesitate to take part in these very technical debates. However, what the Minister has said has caused a lot of concern, no less on the Government Benches than on the Labour ones. In view of what the Minister has said, this might be a good case for investigation by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The more the Minister speaks on these matters, the more suspicious we become. I agree with the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) that if there is any suspicion that only domestic rates are to be abolished, industry and commerce have a right to be concerned, and so do we. Jobs are being lost daily in Scotland, and that process will accelerate if the suspicion is justified.

We all visit firms in our constituencies and hear every one of them complaining about the rate burden. They are already complaining about the threat of rate increases soon to be announced as a direct result of Government policies. As 1 said in the Chamber a little while ago, I listen with wry amusement to industrialists saying "We basically support what the Government are doing, but please protect us from the consequences of it." And that is what they are saying about rates. The rates will go up very substantially—there is no doubt about that—and, as a direct consequence, more jobs will be in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister has said this morning will arouse further suspicions about the reallocation of the burden of local taxation. If reallocation is to mean a heavier burden for industry and commerce there will be an extremely adverse effect on the industrial base, which is already being eroded to a worrying degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of his last speech I think the Minister used the words "ungracious" and "unjustifiable" to describe the suggestion that there might be some political basis for these changes. 1 have often been charged with being ungracious. I rather like it. We are here to make ungracious charges, occasionally, against the Government of the day. I make no distinction between Governments—in such matters I suspect them all. But the hon Gentleman must know that it is nonsense to say that there would be no political implications in a revaluation just at the time of a general election. Whatever irrationality there may be in the mind of the domestic ratepayer, when he sees his valuation doubling he immediately thinks "An intolerable burden is going to be put on me."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The owner-occupier has already been clobbered unmercifully by this Government, If he sees the prospect of his rate burden going up immediately on the eve of a general election, and if the increase is imposed by a Tory Government who have already put impossible impositions on him, there are bound to be political implications. Such people mostly vote Tory. One of the reasons why the Tories want more owner-occupiers is that as soon as people start owning their houses they for some reason or another think it more respectable to vote Tory. Things may have changed but the fact is that that has been the tendency. If people are turned into property-owning democrats they are turned into nice, little, respectable Tories. That is the Government's calculation, and for them to suggest that there are no political implications is nonsense, and the Minister must know it.

12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrast what the Government are doing here, for instance, with what they are doing with the Boundary Commission's proposals. They are not proposing any legislation to defer those proposals until 1983 or 1984.

	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
MR. HAMILTON On the contrary, they are speeding them up, because they know that there are favourable political consequences for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a marked contrast between what the Government are doing in this clause and what they are doing with the Boundary Commission proposals. I say no more than that, except that I hope that this has been a sufficiently ungracious speech as to be acceptable to my hon Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a " stand part" speech, I promise, Mr. Gourlay. This is a mark II version, but it is not the same speech, because, the points that I wish to make are different on this occasion. I shall, of course, be careful in future to be guided by you on the correct procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot has been said about rates this morning. I am one of those people who are cautious about rating reform. That is born of a belief that perhaps an old tax is a good tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is Conservative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all Conservative. There is a difference between being properly cautious and Conservative. I shall explain it on some future occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strengths of local government is the fact that it is able to tax and raise revenue locally, and therefore the whole question of accountability becomes more acute. If that accountability were to vanish overnight there would be a certain loss to local government. Therefore I am cautious. The Layfield committee sat on this matter for some time. It included some distinguished people from local government, such as Sir George Sharp from Fife region and Mr. Geoffrey Drain, whom I know well, and whom I know to be an authority on local government organisation. These people drew conclusions, but their conclusions have apparently not attracted the support of either the present or the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is about time we heard from the Government just what they intend to do about the Layfield report. If all the alternatives to the rating system do not find favour with anyone, what will the Government do? I hope that we shall be given answers to these questions. I would not attempt to make again those points so well put by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). I hope that the Minister will tell us what is happening on the question of rating reform and, in particular, what is happening to the Layfield report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted to the idea that the Government are playing politics with the matter. I hope that the Minister will deal with the point put by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Gascadden (Mr. Dewar). There will be considerable difficulty for the Government in about 1983. There is no prospect of the Conservatives doing well in Scotland again. I cannot recall when they ever did as well before—(An hon Member: "1955.") I am assured that 1955 was a good year for them. I cannot recall much of that election, except that my late father lost at South Angus. That was a pity, because I believe that he would have been a splendid Member for that constituency. However, that does not mean that I am making any comment about the present incumbent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a point that I made earlier about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
administration of revaluation. I should like the Minister to explain to us the impact of the clause on the planning, organisation, execution, collation of information and notification to ratepayers of changes concerning revaluation that will take place as a consequence of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. Perhaps it is better that I do so at this stage, to tell him that there will be no implications in respect of any of those matters as a result of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that there are serious implications. If he is not aware of their existence, it is a sad reflection on his briefing. All the organisation involved in revaluation takes a considerable amount of the regional assessor's time. Planning is needed in respect of manpower and how matters are conducted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is quite right. However, normally such planning begins about two years before the date of a revaluation. So long as the Government's intentions concerning a revaluation are stated to local authorities at about that time, there will be no implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to disagree with the Minister. The experience of local authorities in conducting revaluations has been within the totality of a five-year cycle. There is now a proposal to extend matters outwards. Local government officers and regional assessors are presently working within a five-year programme. The fact that matters can be put in limbo for some time produces difficulty, notwithstanding the two years' notice. If the Minister consults the regional assessors he will find that they share my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having spoken previously on the same point and having asked the Minister certain questions, I shall not take up any more of the Committee's time—except to say that this speech, like all my future stand part speeches, has been made at the appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon Gentleman. Perhaps I should put the record straight. I was the unsuccessful candidate in South Angus in 1955.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 have nothing to say concerning relationships, Mr. Gourlay. You are perfectly correct; my late father was the unsuccessful candidate in 1950 or 1951.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure, Mr. Gourlay, that you were a splendid candidate in 1955.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned by the comments that have been made about a possible delay as a result of a proposal to abolish only domestic rates. That worries me because many of my constituents in East Perthshire have commercial and industrial interests in Dundee. They will be most concerned at the thought that the rate burden could be removed from their domestic premises and yet in business they would be faced with the reactionary authority presently in control in Dundee, which would see this as a reason for thumping up the rates on commercial and industrial properties, with all the effect that that could have on job opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
It is noticeable that only in the past few weeks has the present authority become conscious of the fact that its public utterances on these matters affect confidence and have an effect on whether industrial companies will expand or contract in that area. We should, therefore, examine this matter very carefully, because it means, in effect, certainly in Scotland, that we shall be handing over to at least two reactionary authorities, and possibly others, the possibility of shifting some of the burden on to what they think is a broad back. That back, of course, is now very bent and in some ways near breaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that I should be delighted to fight the next general election on the existing boundaries. I am very happy with East Perthshire and, consequently, I am not worried in the least by earlier comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon Members who speak hereafter will not range too widely about the Boundary Commission and the effect of the abolition of domestic rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) that I have no designs on his constituency. In that respect, I would appear to be unique in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of my awareness and, I am sure, that of all members of the Committee, of the great need to make urgent progress with the Bill, I have no intention of wasting the time of the Committee in spending too long on this clause. However, I must dissent from what my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg), in his brief and eloquent speech, said about the rating system, because that is a subject on which I feel strongly. I believe that clause 1 should not stand part of the Bill. Indeed, I believe that a number of subsequent clauses should not stand part of the Bill, because they represent further efforts on the part of the Government to render the existing rating system even more obscure and difficult for ordinary people and ratepayers to understand and cope with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised that a number of Conservative Members in the Committee have already indicated their concern that the Government are thinking of abolishing domestic rating but leaving commercial and industrial rating in place. I share their concern, and it is a happy day when I find myself in total agreement with the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Stewart) on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general issue of the rating system, my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) has already referred to what was said in the past by the Prime Minister. She said a number of things in the handout that was mentioned. The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) said that that commitment did not hold good for the present Government. I shall again read what was said by the right hon Lady:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have decided to take the historic step to abolish the present rating system over a five-year Parliament."</p></blockquote>
Not that five-year Parliament but any old five-year Parliament, I contend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
again tries to widen the debate, I must say that I was about to pull up the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), because that matter is not what we are discussing in the clause stand part debate. We are discussing the change regarding postponement of revaluations, not the rating system or any undertakings or commitments given earlier. I have been lax in applying my ruling this morning, but I want to pull the Committee together and try to keep the debate in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I merely want to make a correction on what the hon Gentleman was saying. I said that the Government stated that they would endeavour to abolish domestic rates in the life of this Parliament, and the hon Gentleman suggested that I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>I am grateful to the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East for clarifying the issue, or even obfuscating it, whatever that may mean. I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, for your ruling. I appreciate your problem, and I am sure that you will appreciate the problems of members of the Committee in this respect. I was certainly under the impression that the debate had widened a little, and that was largely why I wanted to take part now to look at some aspects of the general rating issue, with particular reference to the effects of revaluation and its timing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that my hon Friend is being a little unfairly treated. In his speech on Second Reading, which was quoted by my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden, the Secretary of State said specifically:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The powers conferred by clauses 1 and 2"—</p></blockquote>
we are referring to clause 1 now—
	<br><blockquote><p>"might be required as a preliminary to more extensive reforms." 
	<i>—[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1219.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, in that context, it seems to me that my hon Friend is right and in order to refer to the need for, or not for, further reform of an existing rating system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Second Reading debate is entirely different from those held in Committee. The Committee is now debating clause 1, which contains the power to change the year of revaluation. I am prepared to accept remarks that are ancillary to that, but the debate is now beginning to range too wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that, 1 shall try to get on, Mr. Gourlay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much was said on Second Reading about the need to reform the rating system, not only by the Secretary of State but by the hon Members for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) and for Aberdeenshire, East, who has just left the Committee; evidently he cannot stand the pace. I shall not quote at length what they said, although I am tempted to do so. However, my hon Friends are free to intervene if they want clarification on the remarks of any Government Back-Bench Member on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My standpoint is that the system is fundamentally unfair and arbitrary: that rates paid by ratepayers bear
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
no relationship to the ability of citizens to pay— neither to their incomes nor to their spending. The present system is full of anomalies. This clause, as well as the others, does nothing to do away with those anomalies with regard to revaluation and its timing. Indeed, as the debate continues on this part of the Bill, I believe that we shall discover that anomalies will be aggravated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted to refer to anomalies that exist in respect of valuation in parts of my own constituency, notably, North Berwick. Practically everyone there seems to write to me from time to time. I have yet to receive a letter from the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) who also lives there, but many of his neighbours must have written to me about the problems of high valuations which are fixed on properties. Those valuations bear no relationship to the amount of services that are provided by any local authority in that area. The figures are based simply on figments of the assessor's imagination, as I think the hon Member for Argyll said in his Second Reading speech. It is difficult therefore for people to challenge such figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I think that it would be correct for the Committee to vote against the clause and also to decide that subsequent clauses should not stand part of the Bill is that, if we do not vote on the clause, it will be possible for certain Conservative Members to return to their constituencies and say that they spoke out in favour of a reform of the rating system, that they spoke out against the retention of the domestic, industrial or commercial rating system. This debate gives an opportunity for them to put their votes where their mouths are by voting against what is fundamentally an unfair system. By the removal of this and other clauses from the Bill, the Government would then be compelled to come forward with a much more thoroughgoing review of the system, which, as I said, is fundamentally unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to start by setting the record straight, since this is the first clause of the Government's first foray into local government legislation. The section of the Conservative Party's 1979 election manifesto dealing with the cutting of income tax refers to the rating system. The postponement of revaluation contained within this part of the Bill could assist in the abolition of domestic rating, or industrial rating if we take clause 2 as well. The manifesto states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Labour's extravagance and incompetence have once again imposed a heavy burden on ratepayers this year. But cutting income tax must take priority for the time being over the abolition of the domestic rating system."</p></blockquote>
The Government have so far been unable appreciably to cut direct taxation and it could be said that in the past few months they have increased direct taxation with, for example, the increase in insurance contributions and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statements made by various Government Ministers have been, to say the least, confusing on the Government's intentions as regards the reform of the rating system. There have been hints, nods and winks, but as yet there has been no clear statement. On Second Reading we had statements by the Secretary of State which were almost contradicted by the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
But I leave that argument for the moment to open up a different aspect of the debate—the role of the assessors. When my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and I met some of the assessors they expressed concern that this legislation would take away some of their rights. As I said earlier, the assessors enjoy a unique position, in that they are under the umbrella of local government but are independent of it. Their practice, and the manner in which they have sought to carry out revaluations over the years, has to a large extent depended upon having a quinquennial cycle in which to operate. Most of their calculations are made on this quinquennial cycle, which could be affected by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not take as an adviser on rating and valuation matters the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) with his fertile imagination, but look at the fact that the assessors in Scotland have a creditable record of service to local government in being able to provide at regular quinquennial intervals a valuation of property in Scotland. Their practices and techniques are being placed in jeopardy by the clause. We received the impression that they were extremely worried about the problems which could ensue if this clause were adopted in a cavalier manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that a Government with an effective majority somewhere in the region of 50 can get any order through if they choose to whip on a United Kingdom basis. One imagines they would have to whip on a United Kingdom basis to get a Scottish order through at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may well be some deepseated objection to the system of quinquennial revaluation. It was in the Parliament following the 1955 general election that the legislation to set up quinquennial reviews was introduced. Perhaps there is an electoral graph which suggests that since the 1955 Parliament—in which the Tories in Scotland did extremely well—and since the introduction of quinquennial reviews that is a reason for the subsequent apparent decline in their representation in Scotland. That may be a totally unwarranted assumption, but it occurred to me when we were discussing the political paternity, or otherwise, of my hon Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) that this was a consideration—that the 1955 general election which was the high-water mark of Tory fortunes in Scotland also saw the Parliament in which the legislation that we now seek to amend first introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I should like to emphasise that the corps of assessors is a body of public servants that has been able to make a singular contribution to the smooth running of our local government system. I should like to put a slightly different interpretation on the time scale of my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden. So far as I can see, the Appeal Court will have completed its work timeously enough for a quinquennial review to start in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem over appeals as the assessors' role and function become more complicated. I know that the hpn Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) takes a great interest in such appeals—at least, he did before coming here. As an advocate, he was doubtless able to offer his advice and help to those appellants who sought redress in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should take on board the fact that the five-year
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
system seems to work. To change it would in many respects leave matters open to even greater problems than simply maintaining the status quo would do. Therefore the Government have no reason for introducing the proposal on the grounds that somehow there is an inability to cope with the problems that are created. It is clear that the assessors are perfectly capable of coping with their difficult job; they are able to work within the five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the path to rating reform. Some anxiety has been expressed—not least by the hon Member for Renfrewshire, East, who unfortunately is not in his place at present. However, I am sure that he will read with interest what I say. I should like us to consider the Committee proceedings on clause 23 of the Local Government, Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill. The Minister for Local Government and Environmental Services mentioned the rate burden, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although, as hon Members know, we have our objectives on the domestic rating side, there is no intention that, in future, local government should be paid for entirely by commercial and industrial ratepayers and that there should be no alternative source either from the domestic side or from any other source to make up that domestic element.. . There is no question of trying to add that impost on to the commercial and industrial side."— 
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 6 March 1980; c. 382.]</p></blockquote>
That may well be so in England. Perhaps there will be an initiative in Scotland for a devolution in rating, or something of that sort. We may find that, after this complicated process of discussion and inquiry has taken place, there will be in Scotland some peculiarly Scottish rating system, and that this is merely the first step towards it. However, if that is so, those Cassandras in the chambers of commerce who are continually complaining about the rate burdens imposed on industry and commerce may well be proven correct— as the first Cassandra was. The hysterical outbursts from groups such as the chambers of commerce are clearly expressions of concern about the rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the same problem. If in 1983 there is to be a revaluation that takes account of the galloping inflation that has been coursing through our economic system since 3 May 1979 and which means simply that the value of a house has increased dramatically, there will be considerable anxiety. I know that the Under-Secretary, as an Edinburgh Member reads carefully, as I do—I live in Edinburgh—the columns of the 
	<i>Edinburgh Evening News.</i> The hysterical outpourings in that journal about every aspect of rating and local government expenditure contain little in the way of fact and moderate, cool-headed thinking. The climate of opinion in the country that would greet a revaluation in 1983 could result in great embarrassment to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an assurance from the Minister this morning that there will not be a general election before 1984. Indeed, perhaps now we shall be faced with an extension of the Parliament. I do not know whether another 1,000 peers would have to be appointed to get that measure through. Nevertheless, let us consider a time scale for any potential rating reform. I keep returning to the point that one of the main purposes of the clause could be that it is the first path along the road to rating reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
In the now famous press release given by the Prime Minister when she was environment spokesperson in 1974, she said that there would be rating reform by Christmas 1979. She also hinted at a 9½ per cent, maximum mortgage interest rate, and perhaps we can take that with the same amount of salt as we can rating reform. However, on that basis, if the Government were able to reduce direct taxation—say in 1982, when the benefit of North Sea oil is coming through and the revenue derived will afford opportunities for give-away Budgets—once they have fulfilled the first part of the manifesto commitment which I read out initially, it might be possible for them to rush through some kind of rating reform. The reform might be domestic or industrial, or Scottish domestic, depending on what terms the Department of the Environment and the Scottish Office can agree to. Certainly, in the Government's wild rush to pay off the electorate in some respects, or to bribe their own supporters before an election, by Christmas 1983 there could be an end to the rating system as we know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the misgivings expressed by the Layfield committee about the rating system, but like that committee, I am at a loss to come up with anything better. However, I do not think that the Bill and this clause will greatly assist the plight of the industrial ratepayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention was drawn by the assessor who operates in Central region, Mr. Lawson, to the Alloa glass works. Members of the Committee who are acquainted with the geography of Clackmannan will know that Alloa is in my constituency. The Alloa glass works is one of the major production centres of United Glass. The production of glass involves furnaces which literally burn on up to the point when they cease to have any effective life. This may seem a simple point, but it concerns a specific form of industrial rating which applies to a particular form of industrial activity which requires clear guidelines at the start of a valuation process. If the assessor knows that he has a five-year span within which to operate he can estimate clearly what will be the industrial valuation required for that piece of equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a highly specialised case. I think that you have glassworks in your constituency, Mr. Gourlay, and are doubtless aware of the problem. The Alloa glassworks case caused alarm at one time. It would appear that the 1961 revaluation procedure was introduced in such a way as to improve the position, which will now be further exacerbated. My hon Friend the Member for Garscadden has already mentioned the Claybank case in relation to mineral workings, and we would probably find innumerable examples if we chose to delve into the activities of the valuation appeal courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years we have been able to establish techniques of assessment and valuation in Scotland which have at their heart the quinquennial review. The quinquennial review will be grossly interfered with by this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that within a short time the Secretary of State will have to come to a view on whether the 1983 revaluation is to proceed. That in itself is not important, but if we do not have a revaluation within five years we shall begin to have the type of distortion which caused the problems that arose in Ayrshire and Argyll. We shall begin to have the difficulties in local government finance which have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
beset the English system. It is not for me to argue that everything in Scotland is superior to that in England, but it is fair enough for us to say in this instance that our system of quinquennial reviews has been very satisfactory, by and large, and that the manner in which appeals have been dealt with has been capable of allowing the next quinquennial review to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what is proposed is not being done for short-term political considerations, and in the unlikely event of the Government's being able to deliver an election promise, it is simply another example of their seeking to interfere in the activities of local government and, contrary to their pre-election claim that they do not want to introduce legislation to complicate matters further, with the men in the assessor's departments, who have carried out a first-class job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Opposition may well not divide on the issue, we are certainly worried about anomalies, which the quinquennial review has enabled us to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the valuation of rateable plant and machinery with a limited life expectancy, which in the year of valuation are subject to obsolescence and redundancy allowances, calculated in the knowledge that a proper revaluation is due in five years precisely.

We have tended in today's debate to focus attention on domestic ratepayers, but the clause is central to the worries of industrial and commercial ratepayers. Some of Scotland's processing industries use very expensive machinery and are dependent on a clear indication of what the valuation is likely to be over a five-year period. Those industries could well be jeopardised by the workings of the clause. We do not simply have a group of disaffected ratepayers living in middle-class suburbs to whom Government Members continually have to listen. We also have a substantial group of industrial ratepayers who have already been saddled with the difficulties of high interest rates, an overvalued pound and various other problems which they have had to deal with in their budgets.

Therefore, it is not unreasonable that those with four- and five-year plans will be reaching the stage by 1982-83 where they will have to consider investment in new plants and machinery, if there are still markets available for their products. These firms must be given some measure of reassurance. I do not think that the Minister has been asked to give that reassurance so far. Will he explain how he sees their worst fears being allayed? It is also incumbent on him to give us a clear indication that in the event of a decision being taken to introduce a different form of financing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry, Mr. Gourlay. I shall close my remarks shortly, and I shall veer away from the line that I seem to be transgressing.

May I ask the Minister for a reiteration of his assurance that the clause will not be used to gerrymander for election purposes in allaying the fears of domestic ratepayers? Will he also give us a categorical
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
assurance that the needs of industrial and commercial ratepayers who look at revaluation as an integral part of their forward planning will not be forgotten?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be some system of rating reform, will the hon Gentleman assure us that it will not simply be on the basis of fiddling the revaluation arrangements which have served Scotland well in the last 20 years? They have created within our system of government a group of men who are dedicated to the sensible and appropriate funding of our local Government system—the assessors. These men have over the years built up a body of law and a reputation in local government, and beyond, for being fair and sympathetic. They are a credit to the service which employs them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman finished on a eulogistic note, which I am happy to emulate. I am also happy to give him the assurances that he asked for in his concluding remarks. It will certainly be the Government's intention in reaching decisions on these matters to take into account the very considerations which the hon Gentleman so correctly referred to in his concluding remarks.

I hope that, with that assurance, the hon Gentleman and his hon Friends will feel able to approve the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>:I knew that there was a glaring omission in my earlier contribution. I was in the train last night—never a good start to the day—and was reading an article in the

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is out of order to refer to the absence of hon Members in order to prolong the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not just prolonging the debate, Mr. Gourlay. I want to make a comment on what has been an interesting and worthwhile debate. I shall keep in order, because I am reminded that clause 1 deals with power to change the "year of revaluation". I am not trying to be clever in any way about procedure, Mr. Gourlay, but you will recognise that the argument for possible changes in clause 1 is flexibility. Flexibility has something to do not with the changing of the rating system, which would be a wider matter, but for some reason to depart from a major Act which established that revaluation should take place every five years. I did not intend to stray. I genuinely believed that my remarks were relevant to clause 1.

What I was about to say on the question of domestic ratepayers, is that I am still not clear in my mind what the Government are proposing to do—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
