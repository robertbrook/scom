	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft African Development Fund (Seventh Replenishment) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft International Development Association (Interim Trust Fund) Order 1996 and the draft Caribbean Development Bank (Further Payments) Order 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Liam Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Mills, I see that, according to the Committee list, your knighthood has come a little prematurely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the three concessionary lending arms of multilateral development banks in the International Development Association provides concessional financing to the poorest developing countries, some 79 in total, with a population of more than 3 billion, where most annual incomes are less than $905 a head. We very much welcome the lead that the president of the World bank is taking in emphasising that the IDA's main objective is to improve living standards by reducing poverty, and that all its activities must be a means to that end. That is complemented by two supporting objectives: broad-based economic growth led by the private sector; and environmental sustainability. Those objectives are in line with the United Kingdom's aid programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IDA's funds are replenished every three years and negotiations provide an opportunity for donors to re-examine and agree policy priorities to guide the IDA's operations. Donors reached agreement in March this year in Tokyo on the 11th replenishment—IDA-11. New donor finance, combined with the IDA's own resources, arrears and unused money from the 10th replenishment—IDA-10—should enable the IDA to provide $22 billion to poor countries over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States' arrears to IDA-10 precluded the establishment of a fully burden-shared replenishment from IDA-11 for the three years from July 1996. Accordingly, it was agreed that, for the first year, an interim trust fund excluding the United States would be established, leaving the United States to deal with its arrears. For the other two years of IDA-11, a traditional burden-sharing arrangement was agreed. Subject to parliamentary approval, the total UK contribution will amount to some £477 million over the three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The purpose of today's order is to authorise a UK contribution of £177.6 million to the interim trust fund. I shall seek the House's approval for the remaining £299.4 million contribution next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IDA tailors its assistance, in consultation with each borrower, to the country's development needs, its capacity to implement projects and its demonstration commitment to sound policies and good governance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also consider that, for economic development and reform programmes to be sustainable, the IDA should intensify its efforts to ensure that Governments seek broad participation in their design and implementation. Participation should become an integral part of the IDA's operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their deputies' report donors reaffirmed that, in addition to broad-based economic growth, investments in health, population, education, water and sanitation are vital. They have welcomed the increased share of IDA lending for projects in sectors and recommended that each country assistance strategy explicitly considers the role of the IDA's lending for them. I am particularly pleased that emphasis is placed on education for girls, which has a uniquely catalytic effect on all other dimensions of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together with other donors, we acknowledge the importance of the IDA's continuing effort to integrate thoroughly environmental considerations across the spectrum of IDA projects. We are urging that the quality of environmental assessments continue to improve, and be integrated systematically into project design and implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK's view that private sector economic activity is the cornerstone of job creation and poverty reduction is now common ground. The IDA has a role in assisting borrowers to improve the environment for private economic activity through its policy-based lending and investment in training, institution strengthening and infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IDA's activities financed by the interim trust fund will be guided by all these objectives and will follow the IDA's policies, practices and procedures. Through our representation on the executive board, we shall continue to monitor its activities closely to ensure that the IDA meets all its objectives. The need now is to give the IDA the wherewithal to translate its policies and intentions into practice. I therefore strongly commend approval of the British share of that multilateral enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now wish to turn to the African development fund—that part of the African Development bank which lends on concessional terms. The UK was a founder member of the ADF in 1973. In recent years there has been a delay in reaching agreement on the seventh replenishment because of concerns about the financial status and management efficiency of the African Development bank group as a whole. In particular, high arrears among borrowers and poor management efficiency control led to a general lack of confidence in the bank. The UK was among those donors who declined to contribute to the replenishment of the fund until those problems were properly addressed. We and our fellow donors are now
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
confident, however, that under its new president, Omar Kabbaj, an excellent start has been made in restructuring the bank to make it more effective. Since taking up his appointment in September 1995, Mr. Kabbaj has reduced the size of the bank's staff and introduced a reorganisation to ensure that the bank is run more efficiently and prudently. Most important, the board of governors has agreed on a more rigorous lending policy to prevent a build-up of arrears. Taken together, those actions have restored shareholder confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh replenishment of the ADF, agreed earlier this year, raised special drawing rights of about £1·7 billion—in contributions from donors. The proposed UK contribution amounts to £70·2 million. Those donor contributions will also be supplemented by SDR 730 million of loan repayments and cancellations which are expected to accrue to the fund over the next three years. That will give an overall amount of £2·4 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the replenishment agreement between the African Development bank, management and donors to the fund, policy guidelines for the fund have been established. They are broadly similar to those for the IDA, with the emphasis on poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability. The African Development bank group has also followed the lead of the World bank in adopting a system of country strategy papers for discussion at the executive board as the basis for deciding a clear lending programme tailored to the needs of each borrower. Commitment to sound economic policies, good government and effective implementation are the agreed factors in determining the bank's relationship with recipients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Caribbean Development bank. That has developed steadily since 1969 when the UK became one of its founding members. We maintain a very strong interest in the CDB and have agreed, subject to parliamentary approval, to provide £10·6 million to the fourth replenishment of the special development fund. That maintains the UK share at 17 per cent. The overall replenishment will be $100 million—just over £60 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK has great confidence in the CDB's very experienced president, Sir Neville Nicholls, a Barbadian, who is well supported by a staff drawn exclusively from the Caribbean region. The CDB has proved itself to be a well-managed bank and a cost-effective vehicle for resource transfers. Its financial ratios compare favourably with those of the larger development banks in terms of profitability, liquidity and quality of loan portfolio. Its net income is growing and it enjoys a high credit rating. Special development fund resources account for two thirds of the bank's resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like all of the other banks, the CDB is increasing its efforts to help the poorest. In the process, it is shifting the emphasis from physical infrastructure to interventions in the social sector. Most of the CDB's borrowers are small countries that rely increasingly on the skills of their people in growing sectors such as tourism and financial services. The CDB is responding by increasing lending for human resource
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
development, environmental protection and public health. It is also providing assistance for capital market development and institution-building and supporting policy reform through increased sector lending. Inevitably, that involves a change in the way the CDB works and the type of expertise required of its own staff. The UK is helping by providing technical co-operation to alter the skills mix within the CDB to meet those new priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased to continue the support of successive British Governments to those important institutions dedicated to the relief of poverty and to sustainable development. I commend all three orders to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I have to address you, Mr. Mills, as such—I had hoped that the Committee list was right and that there had been an announcement from Buckingham palace. I trust that there will be one in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three orders are non-controversial. They contain nothing in principle to which the Opposition can object to. I am sure that the Government Whip will be pleased to hear that. Indeed, they involve money commitments to which the Government has already agreed. We are taking action to ensure that that money is available. As the Minister rightly said, the most important thing is the IDA interim trust fund and I have one or two questions about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IDA is the World bank's soft loan window for the poorest countries. As the Minister said, its beneficiaries are the people of the 79 poorest countries, which have a population of more than 3 billion people. The instrument is very important for development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is especially disturbing that the interim trust fund is necessary because the United States Government will default on some of their contributions and will contribute only to the second and third year of IDA-11. I hope that the Minister will suggest to us what pressure Her Majesty's Government are bringing to bear on the United States Government to meet their commitment. After all, they flex their muscles regularly, but often they do not come up with the money to match their rhetoric. I hope that the Minister will tell us that respresentations are being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several International Bank for Reconstruction and Development countries are not contributing to the IDA. What progress has been made to ensure that those countries contribute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that the IDA is focusing on poverty alleviation. However, our experience has shown that that is not always the case in practice. The Minister mentioned our executive director in the World bank—that gives us a great influence. It would be much better if that executive director were nominated by the Overseas Development Agency rather than by the Treasury. We would be able better to monitor the poverty focus—we could ensure that it existed—if the executive director were an ODA representative. Once the Labour party takes power after the next general election, we shall ensure that that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
One problem is that evaluation reports about the poverty focus are not made public. It would certainly be advantageous if they were published, as we would then know better whether the aspirations were really achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
IDA-10, which is coming to an end, contained a commitment of between 45 and 50 per cent. of its allocation to Africa. Will that continue to be the case? A great deal of money will be needed for reconstruction in Zaire and Rwanda as well as for all the other needs of the African continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suspension of the lending operation is mentioned in the report. As hon. Members who are involved know, that could be disastrous. Do the Government think that disaster is likely, and what measures will they take to avert it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can answer my questions about the IDA. We agree that it should be replenished, but the interim trust fund seems to be a worrying trend and pressure must be put on the American Government to meet their obligations. The country assessment programmes are to be welcomed as long as they do not take on some of the features of the structural adjustment programmes of the past, which have been so disadvantageous for many third-world countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the African development fund, according to the ODA's fundamental expenditure review, the British contribution to the African Development Bank and to the fund is expected to drop from £22 million in 1994–95 to £16.5 million in 2004–05. Is that really the right approach to a bank that is suffering severe funding problems in an area of the greatest poverty and need? I hope that the Minister will give that point some thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells), takes a specific interest in development in the Caribbean. I am happy to say that I agree with everything that the Minister said about the Caribbean Development bank. I have no questions and no quarrel with that. It pains me sometimes to have to say so, but occasionally that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the welcome for this statutory instrument, which meets the Government's obligations. In some cases we would have liked to have gone further, but I hope that the Minister will be able to answer my specific questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister, whose remarks I applaud, say something in his closing speech about good government—not in this country but in the recipient nations? It is important for us to ensure, as much as we can at this distance through intermediary bodies, that good government, in its turn, ensures that money is properly spared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to make a couple of comments, largely to reinforce those of my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). The Minister is relatively new to the subject but has beside him the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, who is certainly not new to the subject and with whom I have worked on the all-party group on overseas development for some years. I am sure that he will be able to assist the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three orders are non-controversial, but I should like to drive home the point that comes out in the briefings provided by the ODA for Committee members about the US contributions. In terms of a development within the IDA, it is serious that we have to set up interim trust funds specifically involving countries excluding the United States of America, at a time when the United States is short of its funding of a number of organisations, not least the United Nations. The UN is under considerable threat, needing considerable reorganisation and refocusing. That has been made difficult by the United States, which, it should be said, has the nerve to block the re-election of Boutros Boutros Ghali as secretary general on the ground that he has not been vigorous enough in his cost-cutting exercise. I may well agree, but for the United States to take that action, at the same time as saying that it will not make its payments, is hypocritical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States has ignored the international court of justice in the past. In the past few days, the United States said that if a tribunal set up by the World Trade Organisation to consider the operation of the appalling Helms-Burton Act and its effect on world trade makes a decision which the United States perceives to be against its interests, the United States will refuse to recognise it. We cannot have such a situation. I am pleased that the Government have finally stood up to the United States in voting against the Helms-Burton Act at the United Nations. That is encouraging and may well send a message to the United States that it cannot count on this country's unquestionable support on foreign policy issues.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I recognise the hon. Gentleman's point about the problems caused by the United States' shortfall, would it not be fair to recognise the massive contribution that the United States has made over the years, not only to development aid generally, but to the United Nations' funding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the hon. Gentleman is on the subject of sending messages to the American Administration, does not he think that his own leader could take advantage of his close relationship with the President of the United States? The shadow spokesman for overseas development also lamented over the United States, in a similar attack. Should not the Labour party turn its close relationship to better advantage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not an attack on the United States and it is not meant to come across that way. I want the United States to continue to fund its way and I use the word "continue" advisedly because, in the past, it has made a huge contribution. I want to see that contribution continue because we must recognise that country's relative economic strengths. Also, we should set it in the context of the role that the USA likes to see itself play: it likes to have influence north and south, east and west, and across the world. If it wants to do that—there is no country strong enough to prevent it—it must pay the bill, which means properly funding the United Nations, an organisation that is stationed and has its headquarters in the United States. I am certainly willing, as the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Whitney) suggested, to draw that to the attention of people in the Labour party. I do my best wherever I can to influence how the Labour party approaches foreign policy and overseas development aid issues, and I shall continue to do that. I am not criticising the Government on this matter; I welcome that fact that, for the first time, they have taken a more vigorous stand against the United States over the Helms-Burton Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should other countries involved in the interim trust fund be required, effectively, to bail out the USA? I should not have thought that the USA would welcome being in a position in which it had to be bailed out by the rest of the world, but that is the effect. The replenishment of IDA-11 cannot be effective until the shortfall in IDA-10 has been made up. That is why we are considering the order today. I think it is unnecessary. It is important that countries that have a good and long-standing relationship—it has often been called a special relationship—with the USA should use that to impress upon it that a shortfall of $935 million in its contribution, to be met by other countries no more able to do so, is totally unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley has raised other relevant points. It is important that IDA funding is replenished, that the poorest parts of the world continue to receive the assistance that they need and that the alleviation of poverty is the main aim of Government policy. The latest Foreign and Commonwealth Office report stresses the aim of poverty alleviation. I welcome that but, within that context, we must make our position clear to the USA. I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee what representations have been made, either to the US ambassador in London or to the US Secretary of State, on the specific matter of its shortfall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before coming here this morning, I decided to look back over debates on previous orders, in particular the order of the sixth replenishment of the African development fund, which took place on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee on 3 February 1992. While I was reading that debate, I was struck by a comment made by the late Derek Enright, the former hon. Member for Hemsworth, who, as well as speaking for the Labour party on development issues in the European Parliament for five years, was also the European Union's representative in Guinea-Bissau in west Africa for two years. So he spoke with considerable authority. During the debate, he emphasised the need to co-ordinate the aid policies and activities of the development banks, the EU aid programme, the Arab aid programmes, the UN aid programmes and bilateral aid in order to achieve a co-ordinated, cohesive approach to aid. When that co-ordination is not achieved, aid is inefficient and costly. In a context in which international resources for development assistance are being reduced rather than increased, and at a time when, in Africa, the need for development assistance is increasing rather than diminishing, we must try to eliminate inefficiency and duplication by aid agencies. In winding up that debate, the Minister did not deal adequately with Mr. Enright's point, which was important. I ask the Minister to share with the Committee today the views of the Foreign Office about how the co-ordination of aid programmes of different donor agencies can be better achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I read the order for the sixth replenishment of the African development fund right, the United Kingdom contributed some £79.1 million. In the seventh replenishment order we propose a maximum contribution of £70.2 million, which is less in cash terms but represents rather more of a shortfall when the difference is considered in terms of purchasing power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since Africa is a continent in which poverty relief programmes are needed, it is wrong to reduce the fund. I know that there have previously been serious problems about the integrity and management of the African Development bank, but they are being addressed by the new president of the bank, Mr. Kabbaj. Our contribution should reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley referred to the statement on page 176 of the ODA's fundamental expenditure review. It anticipates that the United Kingdom's contribution to the African Development bank and to the ADF will reduce from £22 million in 1994-95 to £16.5 million in 2004. However, our contributions to other international development banks, including the Caribbean Development bank—which we shall also discuss this morning—is not expected to reduce over that period. The need for development—and for a development bank in the Caribbean—is clear; I do not seek to argue against it. However, the standard of living of most people in the Caribbean is higher than that of most people in sub-Saharan Africa. I cannot for the life of me understand why we are reducing our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
contribution to the ADF—especially, if I may say so, on the day that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will get to his feet in the House and tell this country about the strength, vitality, vigour and growth of the British economy. I also do not understand why we should reduce our contribution to that fund but not to other funds for countries where standards of living, although low and requiring improvement, are not as low as those in black Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Foreign Office has to take difficult decisions about reducing the aid that is available. If it is serious about sending aid to the poorest, surely to goodness it should not be the soft loan window to black Africa that takes the cut. As a result of negotiations with other members of the banks why is the Foreign Office preparing to be less generous to the ADF than to some other international development funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Liam Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley for his support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad that negotiations on IDA-11 were overshadowed by the United States' budgetary difficulties and its arrears to the seventh replenishment. Congress allocated $700 million in the current fiscal year towards clearing those arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me a straight question about which representations had been made. The Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke to his counterpart in the United States to emphasise clearly the importance of all donors meeting commitments under the Tokyo agreement. I hope that, for once, the hon. Gentleman feels that he got a straight answer to a straight question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned poverty alleviation. He is of course aware that that matter has moved to the top of the United Kingdom's aid agenda. As we discussed in the House last week, there is a growing consensus among all political parties in the United Kingdom that our emphasis on the poorest and on poverty alleviation should be moved up the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) made a point about multilateral agencies, to which I shall return in a moment. There is no difference between the Treasury and the ODA on these matters. With all due respect to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, I think that it was a little bit of a red herring to mention that our executive director is from the Treasury. There are alternate executive directors from the ODA and there is close co-operation between the two. Anyone who has dealt with my right hon. Friend Baroness Chalker will know that she is a forceful personality. I would wager that there are very few in the Treasury who would be able to stand up to the force of her arguments on any of the issues—I reckon that her knowledge is far greater than that of anyone in the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The United Kingdom model is one that we must try to export more and more. We intend to do so through the considerable influence that we have in the World bank and other multilateral organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley asked specifically about structural adjustment. I know from discussions with non-governmental organisations and other organisations with an interest in aid that there is a great deal of interest in the structural adjustment programme and a feeling that it has often been applied too harshly. It is encouraging that the World bank is considering tailoring its programmes to individual countries and that it is examining poverty assessments, public expenditure reviews and national environmental action plans. It must be said that evidence from successive reviews shows that countries which consistently puruse reforms have improved economic performance and growth. At the end of the day, that is what we are trying to achieve—it will be the engine that will achieve poverty alleviation. Far too many countries continue to misallocate scarce resources by spending too much on military equipment and subsidies to loss-making state industries and too little on health and education. I was recently in Pakistan when we made those very points to the then Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely understand the sensitivities that have been expressed about the African Development bank. Its management hoped to achieve the same level as the sixth replenishment of the ADF. A sizeable reduction in the United States contribution, which is considered as the benchmark for burden-sharing, implied a replenishment total of about $1.1 billion. The United Kingdom's pledge of £51 million remained at 4 per cent. of the total, so we have been consistent. The hon. Member for York is correct that there have been difficulties with the ADF. I hope that those difficulties are behind us and that we can move forward. It is a great pity that it has taken us such a long time to return to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten) raised one of the most important points of this short but worthwhile debate—the question of good governance. Without the elimination of corruption in particular, it is impossible to fulfil our wish of sustainable growth in developing countries. We must do out utmost to eliminate corruption from the highest to the lowest levels—from the placing of a contract by the private sector to stopping at the traffic lights and being fined by a policeman—because it makes it impossible, with the best of wills, to function in developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To add a final point, we all have a responsibility as we approach the World Trade Organisation summit to ensure that we do the one other thing that we can: to open up the markets of developed countries to exports from developing countries. In that way, we can provide developing countries with the market incentive to make the desired changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather dismayed that the Minister seems to be drawing his remarks to a conclusion without addressing some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Valley and I made about the United States of America. The Minister said briefly that the problems seem to be behind us, but if that is the case, why do we need the interim trust fund? Surely the problem would be behind us only if the United States said, "Here's what we owe you—you can have it." If that is not the case, will the Minister outline the current situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister answer my earlier question and tell us what representations the Government have made either to the United States ambassador or to the US Secretary of State about the United States debt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not paying attention at the outset when I made clear exactly what representations the Chancellor has made on issues of debt. We have made constant representations on the question of United Nations financing. I know that on trips that other Foreign Ministers and I make abroad, we emphasise and try to lobby support for changes to United Nations financing so that we can return to the type of model sought by the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the main problem lies not with the US Administration but with the US Congress? The Republican-controlled Congress thwarts President Clinton and particularly those of his Administration who are involved in foreign affairs and overseas aid. Will the Minister consider making representations to Congress—and asking his colleagues to do so, some of whom have close links with Congressmen in the United States—to stop its dog-in-the-manger attitude, which is especially evident among some of the more right-wing, reactionaries—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People such as Newt Gingrich and Senator Jesse Helms are the flies in the ointment.

	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government apply pressure to their US allies whenever appropriate. I would have thought that the appropriate means of applying pressure was by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor speaking to his counterparts in the US Treasury. I shall not be drawn into the intricacies of the current American political situation. We were doing rather well on a non-partisan basis until that intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley on the United States and the interim fund, I made it clear that the US Congress has made $700 million available this financial year to reduce its $935 million arrears and that we shall return to the normal procedure in the two subsequent years. We hope that at the end of that period we shall return to the normal replenishment programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my answer was straightforward and I am sorry that I had to give it twice. We are discussing something of which the United Kingdom can be proud, whatever our political background, because we are giving a lead on issues such as debt relief and the type of aid programmes. The House should be proud of that because the United Kingdom is giving a lead. I commend the order to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
