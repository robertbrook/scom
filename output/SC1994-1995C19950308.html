</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lidington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that amendments Nos. 16, 6 and 7 would strengthen me penalties available to courts for criminal offences under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of our proceedings last week, I said that clause 12 would provide a defence of due care and diligence for someone who was accused of a criminal offence under the Bill. If the amendment were accepted, the accused person could plead that he had made every conceivable effort to observe the conditions of his licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill appears to create an absolute offence, so that if the terms of a licence were infringed, an offence would have been committed and the appropriate penalty would be applied. It is possible for the proprietor of an activity centre to be let down by members of staff whom he had entrusted to carry out specific safety requirements, and an appropriate defence should be provided in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 would relate the Bill to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. I am prepared to be told that the new clause is technically defective, but I want to require the Government to make an order under the 1974 Act to exclude the proprietors and staff of activity centres from its provisions. It should not apply to proprietors or their employees who commit offences under the Bill. I would be worried if someone who had been convicted of running an unsafe activity centre was able to set up a similar enterprise a few years later without having to declare the conviction and penalty to anybody—not even the licensing authority—because the conviction was spent under the terms of the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should also consider the Government's duty to make available information held, for example, on the police national computer about forms of employment that are exempt from the 1974 Act. It is sensible to make available, at least to the licensing authority, any information held on the police national computer, or in other records, about convictions for an offence under the proposed legislation. Such a provision would enable the licensing authority to make an informed judgment when it inspected premises, tested the qualifications of individuals and determined whether to grant a licence,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other times, the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) would have been a hanging judge. He wants to write steep penalties into the Bill. The danger in stating an exact sum of money, as he has done in amendment No. 16, is that will become out of date and need to be changed. I cannot therefore accept that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10 years in prison suggested in amendment No. 6 seems a draconian sentence, and in circumstances in which an offence was so serious, other parts of the criminal law would come into play—as they did in the Lyme bay case. If an offence constituted manslaughter,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
the appropriate sentence would be available to a judge. A case of such seriousness need not be covered by the Bill because it is covered by criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 47 is important because it makes defences available in certain circumstances for people who may be charged with an offence under the proposed legislation. Somebody running a centre—a good and honest person who had taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the centre was safe—could be thwarted by another person with criminal intentions. As a simple example, a good employer could be presented with a false certificate, wilfully forged by someone who became an instructor. The head of the centre could have examined the certificate carefully and looked into all the circumstances but still have been fooled. Amendment No. 47 would allow the defence that the head or owner of the centre had paid due and proper attention to all relevant matters but had been thwarted by the dishonesty of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the amendments argued for by the hon. Member for Aylesbury are attractive, but in the circumstances I cannot accept any of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow generally the promoter of the Bill. The specific desire of my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury to increase penalties is the main thrust of his amendments, but that would be more restrictive than me provisions that already exist in the Bill. If a higher limit is specified in the Bill, the existing possibility of the penalties being moved upwards in the normal course of events will be excluded. The Bill attempts to tie the penalties to the ranges available to magistrates which are generally reviewed from time to time. It also attempts to make those penalties broadly consistent with those applying in other health and safety areas. That is a sensible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have much sympathy with what my hon. friend seeks to do in his amendments, in some circumstances they might be counterproductive. Therefore, I cannot commend them. For similar reasons the amendment in the name of me Bill's promoter is straightforward and sensible and will add to the Bill's effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to amendment No. 12, my reading of the Bill is that the defence along these lines is already envisaged. However, as has so often been the case, in our discussion of the Bill, I believe that to leave the detailed implementation of that to the framing of the regulations will allow us better to reflect our intentions to provide that sort of defence in the knowledge of me consultation and the regulations in detail. That would be a more effective method than seeking to amend the Bill at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to new clause 2 and here I will read my brief. It says that new clause 2 seeks to exempt from the protection afforded by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 those convicted of an offence under clause 2 of this Bill. That seems straighforward enough. Then it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my view, such persons are effectively already excepted from the protection afforded by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act by virtue of paragraph 14 of part II of schedule 1 to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (SI 1975 No. 1023)."</p></blockquote>
My apologies to 
	<i>Hansard.</i> Here comes the meat of my argument:
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"That paragraph provides that any office or employment concerned with the provision to persons under 18 of accommodation, care, leisure and recreational facilities etc. is excepted from the provisions of the Act. A further exceptions order of the kind now envisaged is therefore neither necessary nor appropriate."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that tightly argued case will convince the Committee and my hon. Friend that his amendment is redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are straightforward and seek to remove the possibility of regulations being drafted to include transitional provisions. I propose that purely because I want the Bill to pass quickly on to the statute book and men swiftly into law and practice. I am a little concerned about the wide powers that the phrase
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
"may include transitional provisions" could give the regulations which might delay the main impact of the Bill for an indeterminate period once it is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I appreciate that the Bill will require considerable change in practice in many activity centres and related operations, it should not be unduly delayed. The pressure of the legislation should be for swift action, where necessary, in adventure centres and activity centres to ensure that they abide not only by the spirit but the letter of the new law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A later section of the Bill suggests a two month delay between the Act coming into force and the date on which it is passed, and I have tabled an amendment suggesting four months. In that case, there will be a gap anyway between passing and implementing the Act. In addition, the main thrust of the Act will lie in regulations that will no doubt follow. That, together with the consultation allowed for in the Bill, will allow all necessary steps to be taken in advance so that regulations can be abided by. There is, therefore, no need for transitional provisions. The Bill's purpose would be more effectively assured without them and if it creates greater pressure for immediate compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reason for my hon. Friend's amendment, but I think that he is being, if I may say so, unduly suspicious of what we envisage. In reality, there are about 3,000 activity centres of the kind that the Bill will cover. It is most unlikely, to put it no more strongly, that it will be possible on the day when the Bill is implemented, and everything is in place to license, to inspect every one of them immediately. That leads, inevitably, to the possibility of a transitional period during which we can make arrangements. I cannot yet envisage what those might be, but they may include a rolling programme, provisional licensing, a programme of inspections, priorities being set for the inspection licensing regime and so on. All of those things are probable and carry the implication that there will have to be a transitional period of some kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that I do not see that delaying unduly the implementation of the Act. One challenge that we face is finding a satisfactory way to reassure ourselves and parents that the centres are as safe as we want them to be while allowing a sensible phasing of provisions to allow centres to get in shape and introduce a proper regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The modest provision that the Bill may include transitional provisions is sensible. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my assurance that it will in no way impede or delay implementation of the Bill when it is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance on those points. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mr. Merchant) expressed the feeling that many of us have felt that we urgently need legislation on the statute book. The Minister rightly said that transitional arrangements are included in the Bill because, in our anxiety to get the Bill into law and to have centres operating higher safety standards, we would not want centres already working to high standards to go out of business because of the technicality that they have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
acquired a licence or even been inspected in the period available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will become an Act and that the regulations will be passed before the end of the year. I hope that the Minister shares my view that, in 1996, when the Act is in place and inspections and licensing are happening, reasonable time will be needed for the 3,000 or so centres to be inspected and to receive accreditation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that time, I hope that inspectors will concentrate on those centres that have caused anxiety in the past. The majority, which have high standards, would not then be forced out of business or commit technical offences if they have not been registered or inspected. I recommend that the Committee rejects the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would tighten the Bill's focus and speed up its practical impact. They are designed to obtain assurances and guidance on questionable matters. I am reassured by my hon. Friend the Minister who responded precisely to my point about the speed and detail of implementation. I understand the need for a period of adjustment, which, as I said, should be kept to an absolute minimum. The purpose of the Bill should not be lost in the complexity of its initial implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words of the hon. Member for Devonport about concentrating on centres where there are known to be problems. I would add centres where the activities carry the greatest potential risk, as activity centres can be divided into different categories. So long as that is done, I am happy that the purpose of the Bill will be pursued as rigorously as possible. In the light of those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d) may include special provisions in respect of Scotland".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would amend clause 3 to permit the Secretary of State to consult on arrangements in respect of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Scottish witnesses appearing before the Education Select Committee's inquiry on the subject drew attention to the challenges of activity centres north of the border. Mr. Nicholas Halls, a professional instructor associated with the Scottish Advisory Panel for Outdoor Education, said in his evidence to that Committee that it would not be sensible to have a single United Kingdom qualification for the operational management of activity centres. He said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"higher standards of experience and personal proficiency are desirable in a Scottish context because of the remoteness of many instructional sites and the adversity of the environmental conditions, particularly in winter."</p></blockquote>
In view of recent tragic events in the Scottish mountains, that message from an expert should be brought home to every member of the Committee. Those sentiments of Mr. Halls were echoed in evidence to the Select Committee from the Scottish Advisory Panel for Outdoor Education and the Scottish National Ski Council. I hope that the hon. Member for Devonport will be able to assure us that the Scottish dimension will be taken fully into account when the regulations and standards of proficiency required by the Bill are drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like my hon. Friend's attention to amendment No. 47—tabled by the Bill's promoter, to which we have just agreed. Amendment No. 47. Among other important provisions, is the flexibility to deal with the Scottish dimension to which my hon. Friend reasonably referred. The amendment makes cross-reference to the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, which provides sufficient flexibility to deal with the type of Scottish matters to which my hon. Friend referred. As I understand the matter, my hon. Friend's requirements will be dealt with under amendment No. 47.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand why the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment. I attended the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts when evidence was taken from Mr. Richard Arrowsmith, the chairman of the Scottish Council for Outdoor Education, Training and Recreation. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are particular regional factors which need to be taken into account. In Scotland we have much higher mountains, much more severe weather, colder water and so on."</p></blockquote>
He was correct. But when the safety guidelines for activities are in place under the successor to the Activity Centres Advisory Committee, they will relate to the risks involved in any activity, rather than the geographical location where the activity will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the west coast of Scotland, it is possible to find a warm, balmy climate, especially in spring, which presents no more risks than parts of England. I could take the hon. Gentleman to the heights of Dartmoor. They can be cold and windswept at this time of the year. Such places can be easily compared with areas of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was motivated properly by evidence taken by the Select Committee on the particular risks to be found in Scotland. However, the regulations will relate to any perceived hazard in an activity. If such a perceived hazard were greater in a place with deeper water or a colder climate, that would be taken into consideration by the guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would broaden the range of organisations that the Secretary of State would be obliged to consult before making an order, issuing regulations or giving guidance under clauses 1 or 2. At present, the Bill states that the Secretary of State should consult the Health and Safety Commission and such other persons, if any, as he considers appropriate. Amendment No. 17 would include the Office for Standards in Education in the clause; amendment No. 18 would add the National Council for Vocational Qualifications and amendment No. 19 would add the Sports Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reasons for the amendments derive from my reflections upon the evidence received by, and the ensuing debate in, the Select Committee on Education. Several witnesses gave evidence that they would like the Office for Standards in Education or some other body with a knowledge of schools to be involved in the framing of regulations and guidance under the Bill. Vocational qualifications were a recurrent theme of the inquiry. Witnesses argued, and the Committee accepted, that staff competence was an issue of the utmost importance in ensuring that we have standards that not only look good on paper, but are properly observed in practice. I shall not read out the whole of paragraph 36 of the Select Committee's report, but I draw it to the Committee's attention and shall quote a couple of sentences from it. The Committee stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We also note the value of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) and Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs) in outdoor education. The Sports Council argued that the development of NVQs would help raise standards of leadership and instruction in outdoor activities. The outdoor NVQ includes both assessment of technical competence and assessment of candidates' understanding of safety attitudes. NVQs can both build on NGB qualifications, and provide qualifications in activities for which there is no NGB award."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sevenoaks)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend support my view that the mention made in that extract of qualifications for safety and the development of attitudes towards safety and the testing of those attitudes in national vocational qualifications is valuable? I wish to support the general thrust of my hon. Friend's arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and agree completely with his remarks. All of us who support the Bill are keen to ensure that we not merely have an adequate written framework of safety regulations, but try to encourage a culture within activity centres and among those who operate and administer them which puts safety at the top of the list of priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for wanting to add the National Council for Vocational Qualifications to the list of statutory consultees is to recognise the importance of training and staff competence in the proper operation of the Bill once it is enacted—as I hope that it will be—and the importance of NVQs and SVQs in attaining that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 19, which relates to the Sports Council, derives from my concern that sports governing bodies should be fully involved at all stages in helping to frame the detailed regulations and guidance for activities that fall within the ambit of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman consider, when framing the amendment,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
drawing on the expertise of acknowledged experts in the area, including, for example, the Central Council of Physical Recreation or the national Association of Heads of Outdoor Education Centres? Where would he draw the line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly wish the Secretary of State to consult those bodies. However, the Sports Council is a statutory body funded by the Government, whereas the bodies mentioned by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) are voluntary associations representing different sporting interests. Successive Governments have chosen to give the Sports Council a particular role, so it seems reasonable to acknowledge that status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point is the expertise that can be drawn on rather than the status of an organisation or its source of funding. The question is whether such bodies can make a meaningful contribution to safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that that is why the Bill provides the Secretary of State with the power to consult any persons, other than the Health and Safety Commission, whom he considers it appropriate to consult. I do not seek to remove that power from the Secretary of State. I simply question whether we should limit to the HSC the list of bodies that he is obliged to consult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument could go on forever. Following the hon. Gentleman's argument to its logical conclusion, one could say that regional sports councils should be included in the Bill because the Government have given them more power. On that basis, why is not every sports governing body, including the British Canoe Union, mentioned in the amendment? It is impossible to list all the people that could be included in such a consultation. That is why I support subsection (3), which sensibly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"other persons … as he considers it appropriate to consult."</p></blockquote>
Surely, the hon. Gentleman can accept that logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) made a reasonable point in so far as one could make an exhaustive list of voluntary organisations to stand from now until the end of time. However, Parliament and successive Governments have looked to the Sports Council to provide a focus for their involvement in sporting life. Through the Sports Council, they have access to the governing bodies of the various sports. That, too, was mentioned in evidence to the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister and the Bill's promoter to consider widening the list of statutory consultees. As in our debates on the previous clauses, I am worried that we are giving great discretionary powers to the Secretary of State of the day. Although we shall receive assurances from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth), the present Minister on how he intends to implement the Bill, we have a duty to ensure that the Bill is properly implemented and guidance properly drafted and disseminated, no matter who is Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with what my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said in moving the amendment. My amendment No. 33 has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
slightly different emphasis, as it does not name individual organisations, but places the onus on the Secretary of State to consult educational organisations. I specifically steered away from naming them for the reason given in an intervention—that one could go on for ever. It is important to establish the principle that the requirement to consult should not apply only to the Health and Safety Commission. Significant though the commission's role is, another important party is involved in activity centres—the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Select Committee report on outdoor activity centres shows, many relevant and helpful submissions came from organisations that directly represent teachers—the National Union of Teachers, Professional Association of Teachers, Association of Teachers and Lecturers—and from the Association of County Councils, representing local education authorities. Teachers are at the sharp end, examining and experiencing activity centres from a specific point of view. Health and safety officials examine health and safety aspects. People who run centres are primarily concerned with operating their businesses and providing the services that they set out to provide. The education interests are the consumers. Teachers ultimately make the decisions on purchasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Department for Education is a suitable sponsor for the Bill, because outdoor activity centres for the under-18s are a valued and useful arm of the education process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is precisely my point. The purpose of activity centres is to give extra forms of education to children under 18, so the centres are part of the education service. Teachers assess activity centres from professional experience and expertise, and from a critical angle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Lyme bay disaster, many teachers involved in taking children to activity centres would have warned that considerable risks were attached, and would have told hair-raising stories about the inadequacies of those centres. They could have contributed that valuable input before the disaster. If the Bill is to achieve its purpose, it is important for teachers to continue to have a hot line to the Secretary of State of the day, and the ability to influence the course of inspections and regulations made under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers receive information all the time. I quote from two letters passed to me by a teacher who is involved in taking pupils to activity centres. Both letters refer to Devon and Dorset Adventure Holidays, a company that runs activity centres. I do not want to appear to be critical of the company—I know little about it and the letters do not show the holiday centres in a bad light. However, the letters draw attention to teachers' worries and to the information that teachers acquire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first letter, which is addressed to a teacher, refers to the need for instructors to be properly qualified. It states that part of the process that the centres are undergoing
	<br><blockquote><p>"included reviewing the training and qualification of our instructors, and re-examining the principles on which our training policies are based."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that is being done because of the pressure resulting from the Select Committee's inquiry and the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to qualifications for instructors, the letter continues:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a major breakthrough in our industry, for many activity centres have only a handful of qualified staff on site who oversee the work of their less or unqualified colleagues."</p></blockquote>
It then makes the case for proper qualifications, which we would support. The letter was from a person who runs an activity centre, informing teachers about other activity centres. That information reached me through a teacher. I am trying to stress the importance of the role of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second letter, from the same source, is even more worrying. It refers to the activity centre's former chief instructor, who seems to have been relieved of his post at some stage. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On one occasion, for example, he returned from leave to claim he had climbed the North Face of the Eiger by the direct route. We later found this to be a total fabrication."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that, while he was working part time for the company, towards the end of their association,
	<br><blockquote><p>"he fraudulently 'qualified' members of our staff and provided them with forged documents. He even managed to add credibility to this fraud by being extraordinarily strict in the standards he demanded from candidates up for assessment, often sending them back for further training."</p></blockquote>
Again, that is valuable information about qualification of staff—in this instance, fraudulent qualification—which has been made available to a teacher. It is extremely important that teachers' interests should be properly consulted. If the Bill is to require that the Health and Safety Commission be consulted, that should extend to teachers' organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to reassure my hon. Friends immediately by telling them that the Department for Education and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State are more and more in the habit of consulting widely—for example, on the special educational needs code of practice and on the development of under-fives policy. We consult widely as a matter of course because that is an important part of the process of developing policy and in our self interest. It would be inconceivable to develop policy on such matters without consulting all legitimate interests and all those who are knowledgeable in the ways suggested by my hon. Friends. The HSE is already holding consultations with ACCA and Ofsted—one of the bodies referred to in the amendments. The local authorities, also referred to, are already represented on the HSC. That means that some of the cover that my hon. Friends' amendments seek to provide already exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question teased out by Opposition Members, was whether we will add to the quality of policy development and the effectiveness of consultation by specifying in the Bill organisations about which we all have strong feelings. Every member of the Committee could no doubt come forward with a favourite organisation that absolutely had to be consulted. That would give rise to several dangers. One is that the inflexibility of writing names into the Bill would give rise to problems if one wanted to add to the list later—not that other organisations would be excluded, but that those already in the Bill would be in a higher echelon, as though it were more desirable to consult them than any others. We do not want to get into that business. However worthy the list—and, goodness me, it is worthy, for who am I to
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
say that Ofsted, NCVQ and the Sports Council should not be consulted?—we could all think of other bodies that should, and will, be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reassure my hon. Friend, let me say that there should be no doubt that the Secretary of State of the day will consult widely—not only the bodies named by my hon. Friend but many others covering sporting interests, the interests of outdoor activity centres, educational interests and those involved with health and safety. He will do that because it is in the Government's interests to do that to get the policy right. I recommend that the Committee resist the obvious temptation of naming worthy bodies in amendments and leave it to the self-interested discretion of the day, if I may put it that way, to cover those bodies and more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite taken by that Pauline conversion to consultation, listening to the interests of teachers and what have you. I shall be brief because I fully support what the Minister said—a rare moment of cross-party agreement. One version of the story is that Saul of Tarsus fell off his horse on his way to Damascus; in that case, we can assume that an equestrian society would have been best placed to give him advice on horsemanship for his future reference. We could go on ad infinitum listing the organisations that could advise a Secretary of State on how best to address safety in activity centres. It would be premature, as the Minister said, to include some organisations because that would exclude many others whose expertise is undoubted, and necessary to promote the kind of safety we need in those centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The value of the amendments is that they have given us the opportunity to air concern that consultation should be wide and include a large range of interested parties. I emphasise particularly the importance of not giving the Health and Safety Commission alone a dominant role in discussions. Its focus, as I have said before, is bound to be on health and safety and there is a danger that the educational and personal development opportunities provided by the centres could be diminished if health and safety, thinking played too dominant a part. That is why it is important to include the educationally interested, who are looking at what the centres can provide by way of opportunity for growth and development for young people, and to ensure that their role is not diminished as a result of the necessary statutory regulation that the Bill will properly introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally support the arguments expressed forcefully by the hon. Members for Aylesbury and for Beckenham, but, unfortunately, I cannot support their amendments, for the reasons that the Minister has given. A look at the Select Committee's report reveals that more than 90 bodies submitted evidence. The line in the Bill to which the amendment refers would have been rather crowded had we included those 90 and perhaps another 90 that would have liked to submit evidence or be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury says that amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19 would widen the list of consultees. I would say that the amendments could actually limit the number of consultees. Putting certain organisations on the face of the Bill could appear to rule out others. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not disagree that local education authorities should certainly be consulted, partly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
because they run centres and partly because they have profound responsibility for possibly three quarters of the children who attend the centres. We could have included independent schools, grant-maintained schools—which are in a different position—scouts and guides, teachers' organisations and governors, who have a special responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Bill gives the Secretary of State wide discretionary powers. That is the nature of primary legislation. We have to place considerable trust in the Secretary of State and the Minister, who will oversee the Bill's passage to the statute book. I was pleased to receive the Minister's strong asurances. For those reasons I ask the Committe to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comments of my hon. Friend the Minister and of the hon. Member for Devonport were reassuring. I was especially grateful for the Minister's unqualified assurance that he would seek a wide range of consultees before framing regulations under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) summed up the point of the amendments when he urged the Committee to take account of a wide range of interests, apart from health and safety. We should ensure that the consultation process is not too narrow and that one interest does not dominate at the expense of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have misgivings about including only the HSE in the Bill. As a general principle, I believe that when members of both Front Benches agree, it is time to start counting the teaspoons. However, I accept the assurances of my hon. Friend the Minister and of the hon. Member for Devonport, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have already expressed anxiety about the amount of discretionary power that the Bill affords a Secretary of State, and the extent to which Parliament, by consenting to an enabling Bill, relinquishes its power to scrutinise and amend proposals in secondary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require any regulations made under the Bill to be approved by an affirmative resolution of both Houses rather than under the negative resolution procedure. That would provide for greater parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the accepted practice in the House has been for the negative resolution procedure to apply to statutory instruments relating to safety matters.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make a judgment about whether we believe that the negative resolution procedure gives sufficient safeguards and would almost certainly be a faster track for the Bill or whether the Committee and the House should feel sufficiently uneasy about the Bill, for any reason, to put it through the more rigorous and long-winded affirmative resolution procedure. That is a matter for members of the Committee to judge. I believe, particularly in view of the precedent that I have just described, that the House has in the past been satisfied that safety matters can be dealt with satisfactorily through the negative resolution procedure. For that reason and the other balance of judgment that I have suggested, I hope that the Committee will feel sufficiently comfortable with the negative resolution procedure not to accept my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am strongly opposed to the amendment. The hon. Member for Aylesbury said that the amendment would give a greater degree of parliamentary scrutiny. I fear that it could open the door to someone who wanted to wreck the Bill or to weaken its proposals. The thorough scrutiny that the regulations require should properly take place in a Committee such as this at the statutory instrument stage. I hope that when the statutory instruments come forward, they will receive the careful line-by-line scrutiny that they deserve. However, when it comes to the Floor of the House, having the negative resolution procedure could delay the regulations and could allow an unsympathetic Member, in a way that did not reflect the general feeling in the Committee or the House, to wreck part of the Bill or to slow it down undesirably.

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
instead to make loans available. I make the suggestion on the following basis. We have heard a great deal about the companies that run activity centres. It seems to be generally accepted that there is a lot of money in this business. Charges are high and the demand is considerable and growing. Wherever possible, Bills of this nature should be financially self-supporting. We are dealing with profit-making centres and we are entitled to expect that the people who run them should maintain acceptable standards of quality and safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a lot of money to be made out of such centres, but, by and large, I do not believe that that is the reason why they are set up. From my knowledge, a large number of them operate not entirely from an altruistic motive, but for the benefit of the community, rather than from a profit motive. That is why I am particularly worried that the structure of the inspections should be such that it will not place too much burden on those centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend, although I accept that some centres are run primarily from altruistic motives rather than as profit-making centres. As with any business, often more than one motive involved. Profit is one motive, but people also choose to go into a particular business because, for one reason or another, they feel that they have an affinity with the service provided. With most businesses, there is an altruistic element, but profit is an important motive. All that I need do to justify my argument is to show that profits are made. There is money in the business and money is available. The onus should be firmly on the businesses concerned to assure people that their level of safety and quality is at an acceptable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Bill even came along, activity centres got together through their organisation and were prepared to put into effect their own safety system—their own inspections, standards, qualities and regulations—and to fund that system themselves. They accepted that would cost them money, but they also accepted that it was a necessary part of their credibility, as well as an important part of the service that they offered.

For all those reasons, I take what I judge to be a premise in the Bill—that the polluter should pay. In this case, the person providing a service in which safety is paramount should be responsible for ensuring acceptable standards. I am quibbling only about the means by which the process is pump primed because, according to the Bill, the grant would be for pump priming—not for the continuing process of regulation, which would be funded by the activity centres themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept that pump priming is necessary, it should not be in the form of a once-and-forever grant but in the form of a loan. That would put a fair onus on the business to repay it, albeit at advantageous rates and over a period of time. That would achieve the purpose of the Bill and would more clearly state where the responsibility lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled by the amendment for two reasons that are slightly connected. First, my hon. Friend's amendment would make the approach in that part of the Bill inflexible. It would specify loans and would not allow for the possibility of grants. The other aspect that
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
puzzles me—although I am assured that this is okay—is that, if my hon. Friend reads the existing wording, it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make grants".</p></blockquote>
It continues to state that
	<br><blockquote><p>"grants under this subsection may be made subject to such conditions, including conditions as to repayment".</p></blockquote>
I do not want to be pedantic, but I always thought that the whole idea of a grant was that it was not subject to repayment. I checked with my experts and they assured me that was not a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains a proposal inimical to the English language—a grant that is repayable. The Bill as drafted gives flexibility in that it offers the alternative of a grant or a repayable grant—I stick to that term, for the sake of the argument. Although I agree with the spirit of my hon. Friend's remarks, there may be circumstances in which a grant, in the traditional sense, may be appropriate in some circumstances and I want that flexibility in the Bill. However, I am reluctant to be too precise before we know the likely level of fees, costs and so on, which is germane to my hon. Friend's argument. I should be more comfortable with the existing form of words, provided that the Bill's promoter can reassure us as I understand that it gives the desired flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beckenham said that he had tried hard to drive a wedge between the Minister and me, but on this occasion he has not succeeded in doing so. The hon. Gentleman said much that was right: there are some large centres that are extremely profitable, highly successful and extremely well run. They charge reasonable fees to the users. However, some of the 3,000-odd centres are not profitable and, as the hon. Member for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer) said, they are run more for altruistic reasons than for profit. Such centres may find paying for a licence and accreditation a considerable burden. The Bill must draw a fine line between rightly making those who make a profit pay for accreditation and inspection and putting out of business those organisations that operate within a fine profit margin to high standards, but mainly for altruistic reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to the hon. Member for Beckenham that it is possible that the scout and guide movements as a whole—not individual packs—may have to be accredited. Individual independent schools may offer activities in the holidays. I would not want to place a greater burden on those smaller operators than was absolutely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will be a sliding scale of charges so that the biggest operators making the most money pay more than smaller centres operating much tighter units. There must be flexibility to allow the Government to give a grant to the licensing body to set up the accreditation scheme. Line 19 of the clause allows the Secretary of State, if he deems it necessary and possible, to seek repayment of the grant. If we accept amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 38, too many restrictions would be placed on financing which could jeopardise the operation of the regulations which we desperately want to be in place at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this will be my last throw in the Committee, I shall be generous to the promoter of the Bill and accept the gist of what he said. However, I must put on record one or two anxieties that remain. My hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
Friend the Minister rightly pointed out the curious phrase about conditions of repayment of grant which was precisely what drew my attention to the clause. I suppose that I could say that if grants can be repaid, loans can be not repaid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A student loan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Given that repayment had crept into the Bill, I thought it more logical to describe the sum of money that is to be passed from one hand to another as a loan rather than as a grant. The hon. Member for Devonport said that he was not sure whether I intended to make the provision more inflexible and that flexibility was a good principle. I accept that flexibility is a good principle, but I had intended to make the provision more inflexible. I was trying to restrict the grant-making authority primarily to making loans, while accepting that loans are sometimes not repaid and that special provisions are then required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to take up two other points made by the hon. Member for Devonport. As befits new Labour's approach to education, he made a point about independent schools and their fees. Independent schools generally operate on the basis that costs that they incur should be passed on to the consumers—the parents—and I see no reason why that should not apply in this case, as elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made another point that slightly concerned me. That may have been just because of the phraseology employed, but he gave the impression that he would like there to be a sliding scale of fees—I certainly agree with that—but that it should match the profits made by adventure and activity centres, or words to that effect. I would not want the scale to match profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I gave that impression, it was wholly wrong. I do not think that I said that. The scale of fees should reflect the size of the operation, not the profits. My point was that many small bodies make limited profits or no profit, and we would not want to penalise them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Merchant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that clarification, which entirely answers my point. I was about to say that a sliding scale of fees is a good concept, but that it should match the size of the operation, showing sensitivity to small organisations such as the scouts, which my hon. friend the Member for Dorset, West mentioned. I do not suggest that the scouts is a small organisation, but it operates in units—I am sure that that is not the right technical term, but I was never a scout—which are small organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sliding scale should match size, but not profits. The profit motive is important. Despite my criticism of activity centres, I do not want to give the impression that I believe that they should not operate as businesses, because they should. As long as centres abide by all the necessary regulations about quality, standards and safety, the profit motive is a good thing, because it encourages the most efficient to survive and grow. Having made those qualifications, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, I ask for clarification as to why it is proposed that the Bill should not extend to Northern Ireland. When that question was raised with officials from the Department for Education who appeared before the Select Committee on Education, they assured the Committee that the Government intended that the measures provided for under the Bill should be extended to Northern Ireland as quickly as possible, using the established procedure of secondary legislation. Having been a member of the Northern Ireland Committee, I find it profoundly unsatisfactory that we have to deal with Northern Ireland legislation that way. I hereby register my unhappiness that we cannot deal with the entire kingdom through this one piece of primary legislation. I ask for an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister and from the hon. Member for Devonport not only that Northern Ireland will be covered but that the same safety regime, with whatever regional conditions are appropriate, will be applied to the Province in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury has reflected the position accurately. It has become normal for us to allow our colleagues in Northern Ireland to implement matters in that unique way—by Orders in Council. Now is not the time to overturn that process. However, I undertake to write to my opposite number in the Northern Ireland Office to draw attention to the proceedings on the Bill in the House and in Committee and to express my hon. Friend's view, which I am happy to endorse, that Northern Ireland should consider the measures proposed in the Bill and hasten to implement as many of them as are relevant to Northern Ireland. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Aylesbury and by the Minister. It is significant that when I tabled written questions the year before last, asking for lists of centres in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, only the Northern Ireland office was able to provide me with one. That suggests that this is a matter of considerable importance to people in Northern Ireland. I am sure that the appropriate action will be taken there to implement the Bill's provisions in that part of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>ANNUAL REPORT ON OPERATION OF ACT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>"The Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament an annual report on the operation of this Act.".—[
	<i>Mr. Lidington.</i>]</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 would require the Secretary of State to lay before both Houses of Parliament an annual report on the operation of the Bill. It is necessary, for two reasons, to provide a procedure that allows parliamentary scrutiny of the operation of the legislation. First, Parliament should be able to consider the regulations as they have been applied in practice, to determine whether they are working adequately and whether the officials charged with their enforcement have acted properly and reasonably—or whether they have sometimes been too zealous or too lax. Secondly, Parliament ought to be able to keep an eye on the expenditure and the administrative structure of the licensing authority. If necessary, its accounts and its workings ought to be subject to the scrutiny of the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause suggests one way in which that objective might be accomplished. It requires the Secretary of State to produce an annual report on how the Bill operates. If the Government or the promoter of the Bill have an alternative measure in mind that would meet that objective, I would be happy to consider it, but there is an important principle at stake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, I want to express some doubt about the bureaucratic nature of the proposal made by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, although I accept its principle. Members of the Committee will have received representations from the Consumers Association expressing particular concern—like that expressed in the Committee on a number of occasions—about what will happen before the Act is fully in force and how users of centres can be advised of the status of each centre. Whatever proposal comes from the debate, and I look forward to my hon. Friend the Minister's comments, I hope that at least the problem of interim information can be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can immediately reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury that we envisage that this matter will be dealt with. I have in mind a formulation that the Health and Safety Commission, which already produces an annual report, would subsume within that a report on the efficacy, effectiveness and cost of the proposed new regime. That is probably more satisfactory, given the commission's independence and expertise, than having the Secretary of State report. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend the reassurance that he sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should give careful thought to the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, Northwest (Mr. Stern) because there will be an important transitional period which, in some ways, has already started. We want to make sure we have the best means of providing information to satisfy schools and parents now, in advance of the full operation of the Act after consultation, regulations and the transitional implementation period. Some of that is in place, but I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West to give an up-to-date report on how I see
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
things now and indicate how we see things going ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his reassurances. He has met the objective that I sought in tabling the new clause. I think that this will be my parting shot in Committee, so may I say that I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Devonport for the constructive way in which they have responded to debates on the Bill? I have found their comments and assurances helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>Title</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>To provide for the regulation of centres and providers of facilities where children and young persons under the age of 18 engage in adventure activities and for the establishment of prescribed minimum standards of safety in the provision of such activities and the maintenance and use of equipment and premises for the purpose of such activities</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in line 1, leave out "Provide" and insert "Make provision".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 55, in line 3, leave out from "activities" to end of line 6 and insert

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move the amendment to adjust the long title of the Bill so that it is in keeping with the contents. The long title was written when the Bill was presented to the House and the Bill was then a comprehensive, self-standing piece of potential legislation. Had we been discussing that in the Committee, this would not have been the last Committee sitting and we might have been sitting late into the evening and next morning. I am sure that hon. Members on all sides would have welcomed that on a matter of such importance. However, because we are dealing with a piece of enabling legislation. The long title must reflect changes to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will notice that although some items have been removed from the long title because the Bill no longer covers them—for example, the prescription of minimum standards of safety in the final three lines—amendment No. 55 would add the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"including provision for the imposition of requirements relating to safety",</p></blockquote>
so that extremely important aspect of safety is still in the title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With your leave, Mr. Hill, I too shall say some parting words as we come to the end of our proceedings. I am most grateful to the Minister, for whom I have infinite regard, for having graced the Committee with his usual highly refined dress sense. I noticed today that my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is wearing a tie almost as loud as the Minister's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for the crisp eloquence with which he graces these occasions. He must have had an extraordinarily good Christmas this year, because when I spoke to him before Christmas he was not minded to accept the measures in the Bill. Perhaps it was the Christmas lunch served up by Mrs. Forth, or the fact that she is a lawyer and a mum that changed his mind. I welcome his change of mind and thank him, his Department and the civil servants who have been extremely helpful to him and to me in putting the Bill into a form that can gain widespread acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that it is traditional for a Minister to treat members of the Committee to champagne after the proceedings have closed. He should not break with any long-standing traditions of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Members for Beckenham and for Aylesbury for tabling many amendments that allowed proper discussion and debate on important matters. Their comments are on record, and I am sure that they will be taken into account when we come to produce the regulations. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland), although she is not with us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Sevenoaks and for Bristol, North-West made testing and helpful interventions to tease out moving amendments and to extract further information that has been extremely useful to the Committee. The hon. Member for Dorset, West has a personal involvement in the matter and we were fortunate to have the benefit of his long experience—especially as the tragedy that sparked off the need for the Bill happened so near to his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Porter) kept a stern eye and a still countenance on our proceedings. His contribution in producing the Select Committee report has been highly valuable. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Streeter) is not with us at the moment but I am grateful for his support over the past two years, as a fellow Plymouth Member. He was fortunate enough in the first week of the Committee to have had a debate on the Floor of the House about the live export of animals—another issue that is important to Plymouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me refer to my hon. Friends, who are, strangely, on the opposite side of the Committee. I am grateful to my hon. Friends, who have shown so much interest in the Bill and have supported me. The hon. Member for Beckenham mentioned new Labour. I assure him that the Labour Members in Committee were chosen for being old socialists. I feared that if I included too many new Labour Members, they would have tabled so many amendments to clause 4 that we would have been debating the Bill until 29 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has a great deal of canoeing experience. Within hours of the tragedy, he visited me and we have held discussions almost every week since then. His detailed knowledge of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 was useful, especially when we considered the early clauses. I am grateful for the assistance of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), whose knowledge of the HSE's work and his understanding of
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
children's education was valuable not only to the Committee but to me during the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were fascinated by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcasfle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding), who clearly has an intimate knowledge of the sea and sailing. None of us will forget the "little things at the end" and the "holes in the side". In years to come, many of us will take out the record of our second sitting and read it with amusement. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) who kindly provided the proper names of the parts of the boats. She, too, has been a source of assistance and support during the past two years. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) has kept a stern eye on our proceedings. She has a great deal of experience in education and interest in matters that relate to children. I thank her for her support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Front Bench has been supportive to me and to the families who lost their children in the appalling tragedy. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Walton for continuing that support and for his contributions to our proceedings. Who knows, he may be responsible for implementing part of the Bill in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a pleasure to serve under such an experienced Chairman as you, Mr. Hill. The subjects that we discussed are relevant to your constituency in Southampton and to that part of the country, where many sports on the sea take place. Therefore, our proceedings wil have been of personal interest to you, Mr. Hill. Your experience with the Royal Fleet Auxiliaries will have contributed to that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education Select Committee's last recommendation and conclusion reflects all our views. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be possible to implement legislation which reduces the level of risk in such activities to a minimum without reducing the opportunities for young people to participate in them. Above all, we hope that the passage of legislation will help entrench among providers—and users—of activity centres the culture of safety which is ultimately the best defence against tragedies like that at Lyme Bay."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the alterations to the long title that the promoter suggested. They bring the title into line with the spirit, thrust and detail of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing so, I congratulate the promoter of the Bill for having so skilfully steered it through both its Second Reading and Committee stage. It is a great tribute to the hon. Gentleman's persistence in something in which he has always strongly believed, that he has been able to persuade not just the House but the Department and all others involved that the Bill is the appropriate response to what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must just correct one thing that the hon. Gentleman said. He is mistaken about tradition. Generally, the promoter of Bill and the role of the Minister coincide. It is always the promoter of the Bill who provides generous hospitality after Committee meetings—not, I regret the Minister. That is something that he and I may have to sort out later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add my own words of gratitude to you, Mr. Hill. It is in no small part due to your skill, forbearance and firmness in dealing with us in committee, harmonious though most of it has been, that we have been able to conclude detailed consideration of the Bill in such good order and in reasonable time. If I may say on behalf of all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder, Mr. Hill, whether I may exercise the prerogative of which you will know only too well of being the doyen d'age of this Committee to say a few final words to the hon. Member for Devonport. Our interest was triggered by the fact that it concerned our constituents and our constituencies. Those tragic events of two years ago are in our minds and will remain there for the foreseeable future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay a tribute to the hon. Member for Devonport. I do not believe that another person in the House today could have carried through the task with the good humour, common sense and dedication over the last two years, particularly during the sittings of the Committee. Conservative Members recognise his attributes and I hope that someone from the Labour Whips Office might have marked his card and that he will at some point be able to play a more active part in such Bills. He has a quality that I have found very rare in the 23 years that I have been in this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
