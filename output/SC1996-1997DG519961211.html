	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to consider the draft Social Security (Child Maintenance Bonus) Regulations 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Sir Roger, as the Chairman of our deliberations today. It is a pleasure to serve on the same Committee as you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to the regulations that provide for the introduction of the child maintenance bonus scheme. As members of the Committee may recall, provision for the introduction of a child maintenance bonus scheme was made in the Child Support Act 1995, which received Royal Assent in July last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic principle underlying the Government's child support reforms has always been that all parents should take financial responsibility for their children whenever they can afford to do so. That principle commanded all-party support when the original Child Support Bill went through the House in 1991, and it has continued to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the creation of the child support system and the Child Support Agency, however, the Government have listened carefully to comments made and concerns expressed by members of the public, interested organisations and Members of Parliament. The Child Support Act 1995 was designed to deal with those parts of the system that had given rise to particular concerns. One of those concerns was the perception that parents with care on benefit did not gain direct advantage from the maintenance that was paid for their children. That has never been the case. Child maintenance offers real help to those on benefit who are trying to re-establish themselves in work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we decided that there was a need to make the advantages associated with the payment of maintenance clearer to parents with care and to absent parents. The child maintenance bonus is intended to achieve that. However, that is not all that the new initiative will achieve. It has also been designed as a part of the Government's work incentives campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, parents with care are not required to seek work if they have no wish to do so. However, we believe that it is right that we should be fully supportive of parents with care who wish to improve their family's standard of living by taking
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
employment. The child maintenance bonus will be an extremely useful and attractive incentive which will encourage parents with care to find employment and give substantial practical help to those parents with care when they make the transition from benefit to work. That is the context behind the regulations that introduce the child maintenance bonus, which is provided for in the Child Support Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to discuss the regulations in great detail—I shall confine myself to outlining their main provisions. The basic rules of entitlement to a child maintenance bonus comprise three elements: the receipt of a qualifying benefit, the receipt of child maintenance and the return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The qualifying benefits are income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance. The parent with care or her partner must be entitled to one of those benefits. The second prerequisite for entitlement to a bonus is child maintenance, which must be in payment, whether it be paid direct to the parent with care or collected by the Secretary of State. Thirdly, to receive a bonus, the parent with care or her partner must start work or increase the hours that they work so that they stop claiming the qualifying benefit. The parent with care will be paid a child maintenance bonus as a lump sum when she leaves benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that the parent with care's maintenance assessment is £5 or more, the bonus will build up at the rate of £5 for each week that a parent with care is on benefit and child maintenance is in payment. Where the child maintenance that has been paid comes to less than £5 per week, the bonus is equal to the total maintenance paid. That means that, in those cases, the bonus is equivalent to a full disregard in the benefit assessment. Furthermore, in those cases where the absent parent is unemployed and making a contribution to maintenance from his benefit, that contribution will be counted in working out the bonus. The maximum bonus will be £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make the impact of the scheme on real individuals clearer, let us look at an example. What would the scheme mean for a parent with care who returned to work after spending, let us say, a year on benefit? It could mean a tax-free cash lump sum of up to £260. I am sure that members of the Committee agree that such a sum would represent a useful incentive to seek work, an encouragement to take what is often perceived as the risk of entering the world of work and a considerable contribution towards the costs incurred in leaving benefit for employment. The reason why we decided to link the amount of bonus to the actual payment of child maintenance is simple. By so doing, we have ensured that the bonus will act not only as a work incentive, but as an incentive to all parents to co-operate with the Child Support Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental principle behind our child support reforms and the Child Support Agency—that all parents should financially support their children whenever they can afford to do so—is right. It is right, too, that all parents should co-operate with the agency, and right that entitlement to a child maintenance bonus should depend on the co-operation of both parents. I believe that the bonus scheme will be an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
effective measure in encouraging both parents with care, who will receive a direct cash benefit from maintenance paid for their child, and absent parents, who will see their child benefiting from the maintenance they pay, to fulfil their responsibilities and co-operate with the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second package of regulations before The Committee today is a package of miscellaneous child support measures, which simplify and speed up the handling of applications. This package also includes a measure that will act as an incentive for parents with care to co-operate with the agency. A parent with care in receipt of a relevant benefit who refuses to cooperate without good cause may have her benefit reduced. That reduction is known as a reduced benefit direction. The regulations improve the effectiveness of reduced benefit directions by removing the provision that allows a reduced benefit direction to be suspended where there are already other deductions from her income support for arrears, such as a social fund loan or rent and fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government introduced the suspension provision in January this year, having announced it during the passage of the Child Support Act 1995, they did so on the basis that relatively few parents with care would be affected and that the provision would prevent undue hardship for those few parents with care who already had other deductions made from their income support. However, experience since January has shown that more and more parents with care are having their reduced benefit directions suspended. In October, for example, more than half of all reduced benefit directions imposed were suspended—about 1,300 out of a total of 2,500 a month. It appears that some parents with care may be seeking to have deductions made from their income support for the sole purpose of avoiding the effect of a reduced benefit direction. That was certainly never intended to be the effect of the suspension provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, I am introducing a regulation today which will close that loophole by removing the suspension of the reduced benefit direction in such cases. Of course, it is still the case that reduced benefit directions apply only where the parent with care has no good cause for refusing to co-operate with the agency. The answer always lies in the hands of the parent with care, if she has good cause for refusing to co-operate, she can avoid a reduced benefit direction by explaining to the agency her reasons for believing that pursuing child support would cause harm or undue distress to her or her children. If not, she can decide to co-operate with the agency and the reduced benefit direction will be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as those changes, the package includes a regulation to defer the reintroduction of fees until April 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fees for the services provided by the Child Support Agency were originally suspended in April 1995 to enable the agency to concentrate on improving the quality of its work. That suspension was due to be lifted in April 1997. The agency has made significant strides in improving the service it provides to its clients and, to allow that momentum to continue, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Government have decided not to reintroduce fees for another two years. That will allow the agency to continue to focus on its key business of assessing, collecting and enforcing child support liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Child Support Act 1995 included a provision for the introduction of an additional sum to replace interest where arrears of child support were due. Our expectation at that time was that regulations would be introduced to bring the provision into effect from April 1997. For the reasons I have just given, however, for deferring the reintroduction of fees, I shall not be bringing forward a regulation to introduce the additional sum at this stage. For the time being, absent parents who are unco-operative and owe arrears will be expected to pay up to 40 per cent. of their net income under the formula in a combination of assessed maintenance and arrears, depending on their individual circumstances. Absent parents who are being co-operative will continue to benefit from the Secretary of State's decision to limit payments, including arrears, to 33 per cent. of net income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I am also introducing a regulation that will enable the agency to provide a speedier service for those parents with care who are on family credit or disability working allowance. In those cases, the parent with care will no longer be required to provide details of her income and housing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the most significant changes contained in this package of regulations. Once again, I do not intend to weary hon. Members by going over the regulations one by one, especially as they are for the most part of a highly technical nature, but I shall be happy to answer questions on any of the regulations before us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When making changes to the child support system, there are three adult parties whose interests must be taken into account: parents with care, absent parents and taxpayers. The two sets of regulations will benefit all of them. Parents with care who have been receiving maintenance and who leave benefit for work will receive their child maintenance bonus—a cash lump sum of anything up to £1,000. Absent parents will see their children benefiting even more from the maintenance they pay. Taxpayers will find eased the burden placed on them by parents who refuse to comply with the Child Support Agency as more and more parents, encouraged by the measures that I have presented today, agree to co-operate. The regulations are good for parents, good for children and good for the taxpayer. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Wicks 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Sir Roger. I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, not least because my intelligence sources tell me that at least one parent on the Government Benches is anxious to take his children to the carol service at 6 pm. There would be an element of hypocrisy if the Minister was not able to be there with his children because he was in Committee discussing parental responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I want to raise two issues. The first concerns the child maintenance bonus. The Opposition have been worried since the inception of the Child Support Act 1991, which of course we support, that parents with care—typically mothers on income support—do not receive a net benefit from the child maintenance policy. That is because every extra amount of child maintenance collected by the agency is deducted pound for pound, penny for penny from their income support, so there is no net addition of resources for either the mother or the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important because the great majority of one-parent families—about 70 per cent.—are on income support and therefore subject to the provision. We have always contended that it is unfair that those families do not gain from the child maintenance policy. That is not intelligent social policy. Child maintenance policies, as evidenced from the experience in Australia, need the co-operation of parents, in particular mothers, if they are to work. If mothers understand that they will benefit directly through co-operation, it is more likely that they will give that co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always argued for what is known technically as a maintenance disregard, namely that an amount of maintenance—not the great proportion of it—should be disregarded for income support purposes so that mothers and children benefit directly. We support that policy and it is our preferred option. Nevertheless, the child maintenance bonus is a step in that direction and we support the Government for introducing the regulations. They bring some fairness into the system and aid the strategy, to which we are committed, of enabling parents with care to move off income support if they wish to and move towards independence through waged employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy, however, is not altogether fair. The mother—the parent with care—who chooses to stay at home rather than seek work, perhaps because her children are babies or one or two-year-olds, may well say, as many mothers do, that she does not want a job at that stage because she wants to be a full-time mother. That group will not benefit from the child maintenance bonus, which creates an inequity between different groups of mothers. We think, therefore, that a policy of maintenance disregard, which would benefit the parent who chooses to stay at home to look after tiny children, is the preferable option. Nevertheless, we support the broad strategy behind the child maintenance bonus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second set of regulations contain a number of measures, one of which is of particular importance. The matter of benefit deduction was considered by another statutory instruments Committee earlier this year and the Minister has outlined that policy to the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy relates to the issue of collusion, which arises when there is evidence that the parent with care—typically the mother—is not co-operating with the Child Support Agency because she is receiving some support from the father. She may be getting £20
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
or £30 a week in cash, but is not declaring it. In return, she does not co-operate with the agency. She does not supply it with the father's name or his whereabouts. That is collusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are against collusion, which is a politer word for fraud. We want it tackled effectively. The Government's original position was that, where other deductions were being made from income support—when the person was in arrears with her rent or had a large electricity or gas bill to pay—the 40 per cent. deduction would not come into force. The regulations would change that policy and so there would be a 40 per cent. deduction, even if the parent with care may already be losing some of her regular income support to pay back gas, electricity or rent arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, we oppose collusion and support all measures that crack down on fraud, but I remind the Committee that we are dealing with a delicate issue. It is vital that officials of the Department and the Child Support Agency are able to make clear distinctions between the woman who is colluding because of fraud and the woman who is in genuine fear of her former partner and of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some women who have been battered by former husbands or partners have been told by those husbands or partners that, if they co-operate with the agency, they will be battered again. The agency and Department recognise that fact and, therefore, a proportion of mothers every year are enabled not to produce details of the father or his whereabouts. We need to question the Minister today to find out whether he is convinced that that policy is working well in practice, or whether there might be some confusion in saying that a woman is colluding when in fact she is in genuine fear of violence. Although the attack on cheats is of the highest priority, the safety of mothers who fear violence is, in our judgment, paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In July, when we considered these matters in Committee, the Opposition opposed the regulations and opposed a 40 per cent. benefit penalty. Instead, we urged another strategy based on more home visits. We had that debate at that time and, on this occasion, I will not be inviting my colleagues to oppose the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that debate, we heard the view of the Social Security Select Committee, as presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) on 10 July, that a new policy could be implemented, whereby the same process would be used to govern benefit applications and child support assessments. Child support assessment would start on the same day that a mother applied for income support instead of a few weeks later. What does the Minister feel about that view? The Opposition are sympathetic to the idea and would like it to be investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about the cumulative impact of the 40 per cent. deduction when the mother might already be losing some of her weekly income support because she is paying off gas, electricity or rent arrears. That is no small matter. I am informed that in November 1996, about 1.7 million claimants to income support
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
had more than one deduction from benefit. The average amounts are startlingly high, given the low level of income support. I am told that in 1994, the average level of weekly deductions from benefit was £11.99 for electricity, £10.49 for gas, £4.90 for rent arrears and other housing costs, £5.83 for water and sewerage and £6.37 for social fund loans. Given that some mothers could face a 40 per cent. benefit deduction while also repaying electricity bills and perhaps rent arrears, one does not need to be very good at arithmetic to deduce that some of those mothers would be expected to live on very low sums indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is genuine collusion—where fraud is taking place—and the mother is receiving money from the children's father, the question of poverty does not arise. But it makes the point again that the Minister must be very clear indeed that the agency is now sophisticated and efficient enough to distinguish genuine cases of collusion from people who are not cooperating for other reasons, such as a fear of violence. Otherwise, we could plunge many vulnerable families into the depths over Christmas. I wonder whether the Minister could provide us with more information on some of those important points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not hold up the Committee's consideration of these important matters for long. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on the improvements that have been made in the Child Support Agency. I must say, in the same breath, that more improvements are still needed as there are still innumerable cases—as I am sure that every Member of Parliament can bring to mind from memory—of constituents who have had their cases and finances misanalysed and where the agency's rules have not been applied properly. I hope that improvements will continue to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, there should be better action on the matter touched upon by the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks)—better investigation of whether payments to parents with care are fraudulent or genuine, whether through collusion or on their own initiative. We should make quite certain that those points are taken into consideration when the Child Support Agency helps parents to get further support from the absent parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fact also applies in those cases that have nothing to do with benefit. That point might be wandering rather far from the subject of the Committee, but it is worth making in this context. There are instances where people have jobs and are earning more than they are declaring to the Child Support Agency and, therefore, the absent parent is being asked to pay more to the parent with care than is necessarily fair or correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must also be said that better and more precise measurements are needed of the absent parent's wealth and ability to pay. That applies especially to the self-employed, whose income might go quite abruptly up or down. It is extremely difficult for an organization
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
such as the Child Support Agency to keep in touch with that, but there should be a mechanism for doing so more exactly and speedily that is presently the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need a better and more effective allowance for maintenance and other agreements that have been struck between the two parents at the time of either separation or divorce. There is still enormous genuine confusion in parents' minds and I believe that that is often compounded, not eliminated, by the advice by the Child Support Agency on what has been agreed between parents and how that affects the amount of child support that should be requested or given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter that I wish to raise, which touches on this afternoon's subject, is the different treatment for benefit purposes between those with repayment mortgages and those with endowment mortgages. Two people in virtually identical circumstances—one with an endowment mortgage and another with a repayment mortgage—are treated differently. A constituent of mine, who is a mother with two children, is still trying to extract from her separated husband—she is not yet divorced—payments for child support and a continuation of what he has agreed to pay unofficially—it is not legally binding—in terms of the mortgage payments. Her fear is that not only will the CSA not move quickly enough so that she will get the support to which she is entitled, but that when the CSA extracts the support from the absent parent, he will discontinue the payments that he has made specifically for the mortgage and which cannot be allowed for in law—they have to be within an envelope of maintenance. That will mean that only the interest payments and not the repayment payments will be picked up, so that the wife will lose the house eventually. In turn, that will make her and her children a cost burden on taxpayers' shoulders. It will disrupt her family and make it extremely difficult—near impossible—for her to rebuild her life and resettle properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will bear those points in mind when he considers the administration of the regulations that we are discussing this afternoon, which are welcome overall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Rathbone) and to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West for their remarks on the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall not dwell in detail on the points that he made, which are not directly relevant to the matter before us. I welcome his recognition of the improvements that have been made in the performance of the Child Support Agency. As the Minister with day-to-day responsibility for the CSA, I have seen a significant increase in its workload—the number of cases on its books—and a decrease, overall, in the number of difficulties and complaints. The difference is stark. There is no doubt that the CSA has improved, and is improving radically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
My hon. Friend asked me to give a commitment that those improvements will continue and that there is no question of the CSA resting where it is today. I am happy to do so. There is no question that the agency needs to improve further and the package of regulations that we are discussing will be part and parcel of that improvement. My hon. Friend mentioned salaries and the assessment of income. I believe that significant progress has also been made there, not least in the simplification of the process. Perhaps it would help my hon. Friend if I say that if he has any significant cases, especially the last case he mentioned involving the lady who is in danger of losing her house, I should be grateful for details so that I can consider them myself to see what can be done in terms of our policy and administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West, raised two points, the first of which related to the maintenance disregard. As he is well aware, that debate has been going on between our parties for some time, especially during the Committee stage of the Child Support Bill 1995, when I was the Whip responsible for its passage. He will know that the child maintenance bonus was born out of those discussions. It is not a maintenance disregard, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said; it was invented by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It is a subtle and clever way of dealing with many of the arguments in favour of a maintenance disregard without having to suffer the disadvantages, with which the Committee will be familiar. First, a disregard is expensive. I am advised that in 1996–97, a £20 disregard would cost £150 million and a £10 disregard would cost £90 million. Secondly, a disregard is not an into-work measure; in some ways, it increases the obstacles in the way of getting into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West will recognise that we have significantly enhanced family credit: we have reduced the qualifying hours, increased the amount of help with child care costs and ensured that there is a disregard in the family credit system. Arguments over principle will no doubt remain but, as the hon. Gentleman was good enough to say, the child maintenance bonus is an encouragement and a help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's principal point related to the reduced benefit direction. He said that there is a great difference between those who are colluding and making a fraudulent arrangement—he made it clear that he supports the Government's widely welcomed crackdown on such fraud—and those who are genuinely at risk of violence. As I said when we debated the matter in July, the agency has been enormously successful in ensuring that those who are genuinely at risk are looked after through the good cause provisions. We know of no case in which there have been problems with that. During the passage of the Child Support Bill 1995, hon. Members from all parties were concerned that the good cause provisions should be effective and workable and that they should ensure that no one was placed at risk. I believe that they have fulfilled those criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The regulations are designed to tighten up measures that have been abused—as is widely recognised by hon. Members, not least by the Select Committee on Social Security, whose members are moving towards a consensus that benefits should be conditional on proper compliance with the agency. In its report, the Select Committee said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Moving to making benefit wholly conditional on co-operation would require primary legislation"—</p></blockquote>
that is, of course, correct—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and would be a longer term goal."</p></blockquote>
The regulations do not do anything that would not meet with the approval of the Select Committee. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have undertaken to keep the Select Committee informed about progress and we certainly will be doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CSA staff who deal on a daily basis with parents with care are clear that those women who set out not to co-operate with the agency are well aware of, and are not slow to exploit, the loophole that has opened up. That is done by ensuring that they have a deduction in place from their income support as quickly as possible, solely as a means of avoiding the effect of a reduced benefit direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West asked us to provide evidence to support the view that we are putting forward in the regulations. I can tell him that the proportion of such parents with care who have deductions from their income support is already at least double that of the general lone parent population. That reinforces the view that parents with care who choose not to co-operate are ensuring that they have early deductions in place from their income support with the express intention of negating the incentive effect of the reduced benefit direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that the behaviour is occuring against a background of significant fraud and collusion among lone parents. The Benefits Agency's comprehensive and statistically valid benefits review, which was published last year, showed that almost 20 per cent. of lone parents were claiming, or suspected of claiming, benefit fraudulently—the highest proportion of any client group. The CSA's review of good cause, which was published earlier this year, showed that almost half the 72 cases of those parents with care with a reduced benefit direction who were investigated appeared to be claiming benefit fraudulently. The Committee should remember that 45 per cent. of all parents with care who have a reduced benefit direction imposed fail to contact the agency during the whole of the good cause process, yet more than half are able to contact the Benefits Agency to ensure that they have a deduction from their benefit as quickly as possible so as to avoid the effect of a reduced benefit direction. That cannot be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West spelt out the implications of that change on the level of benefit that might be left available to parents with care who have a reduced benefit direction on top of other deductions. However, the answer to that potential problem lies in the hands of the parent with care—if she chooses to co-operate with the CSA, the reduced benefit direction will cease to have effect. If she has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
genuine reasons for not wanting to co-operate, she can be confident that the agency will treat her case sympathetically. The requirement for a parent with care to co-operate with the CSA unless she has good cause not to do so is the cornerstone of the child support scheme and commands the support of all hon. Members. We must not let those parents with care who cynically set out to prevent the agency from seeking maintenance on their behalf undermine the child support scheme by purposely negating the effect of the incentive to co-operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the 40 per cent. deduction has a direct financial impact on the mother in cases of collusion; how successful is the Benefits Agency in ensuring that the father in such cases pays child support? We do not want a policy that places all the impact on the mother and none on the father.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Child Support Agency passes cases of suspected fraud to the principal agency for dealing with fraud, the Benefits Agency. As the hon. Gentleman will know from answers to parliamentary
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
questions and the statistics released by the Department, the Benefits Agency is increasingly successful in cracking down on fraud and in achieving reasonable results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the hon. Gentleman the commitment that we gave the Select Committee: we shall keep those matters under close review. Ministers would have been failing in their duty, however, had they not moved quickly to close a clear and obvious loophole and that is the reason for the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
