	<div class='legislation'>Draft National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, MR. Olner. Although it is usual to take the orders together, I believe that the order that amends the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 is ultra vires. Therefore it might be for the convenience of the Committee if that were dealt with separately, prior to the second order being debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Olner. The instruments are not ultra vires. They have been before the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which considers issues including vires. The Joint Committee found no defect whatever in either instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have taken advice from counsel from the House of Lords who deals with affirmative resolutions. I pointed out certain elements of the instruments which he said he was unaware of before he gave advice to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. He believes that there is an arguable case on whether they are ultra vires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the Committee that only the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments can rule on that. The information before me is that the instruments have been considered and were not found defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Olner. Before we reach a decision on the proposal that they be taken together, would we be able to debate both for a combined period of three hours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Hon. Members will be aware that one and a half hours may be taken for each instrument; there cannot be three hours' debate on one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Olner— I assure you that I am not trying to be difficult—do we therefore debate the substantive regulations first, and the amendment regulations subsequently, if we wish to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee may determine both and debate them together, in which case the time limit will be one and a half hours, or they can be debated separately, with the agreed limit of one and a half hours on each.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, Mr. Olner. Finally, are we now to debate the substantive main regulations rather than the amendment regulations at this stage, without prejudice to the time that we take to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that hon. Members had read the Standing Orders. If there is an objection to their being taken together, the regulations are automatically taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I therefore object to their being taken together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
I wish to make a substantive statement to the Committee because the regulations and the work done on them by Ministers' officials, employers' organisations, trade unions and others involved in the process cannot be overestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud that we have come almost to the end of a road set out on nearly 80 years ago, when first the Labour party tried to divide the House on the then King's Speech to introduce a national minimum wage. It is true that, occasionally, matters grind on slowly in this place, but there can be no slower wait than an 80-year wait for justice for generations of low-paid workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government gave an election promise that they would introduce a national minimum wage. We are now on the brink of delivering that promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hardly anyone in Britain, except Conservative Members, opposes the principle of the minimum wage or the way in which we are introducing it. We will doubtless see today the dying embers of their opposition to the national minimum wage and their support for poverty pay in the workplace and for those employers who are prepared to pay as little as 80p an hour to a homeworker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said that we would consult on these regulations, and that is precisely what we have done. The whole process that we have followed has been one of consultation and transparency. The noble Lord Haskins, the chairman of the Better Regulation Task Force, congratulated the Department of Trade and Industry on the way in which it has carried out this process. The result is the draft regulations before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee will know, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 provided the framework of powers to establish a national minimum wage. The draft regulations before us use some of the powers to put the detailed technical arrangements in place. I shall explain what they will do in a little while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, who has obviously been watching the charm with which his colleague, the unpaid Secretary, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), deals with these matters. Why, when the DTI has placed a note before the Committee saying that consultation finished in November—we all welcome the fact that the Government moved from their original intention on consultation—are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
we discussing the regulations less than a month before they come into force? A large number of organisations have made changes to their operations in line with what the Government originally intended, rather than what they now intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, unlike the previous Government, whom the hon. Gentleman proudly supported, when we consult we are prepared to act on the results. Secondly, given the nature of the consultation, no one could seriously suggest that the Government came to conclusions about it over a weekend. The process of consultation in the sense of receiving information may have ended in November, but we have continued to sit down with small business organisations and others to go through issues surrounding the regulations in meticulous detail, either clarifying their submissions or considering how the Government will balance them. The time has been spent getting the balance of the regulatory regime right within the context of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since June 1998, no one has been in ignorance about the rate of the minimum wage or its starting date. I am pleased to say that, from that moment on, large numbers of employers in Britain started to uprate and pay the national minimum wage. Some 200,000 workers at least who would have been covered on 1 April 1999 will not be covered in the sense that their employer acted in good faith, wanted to be in line with the minimum wage and has already started paying it. Those employers should be congratulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We estimate that two million workers will benefit from the regulations. Employers have welcomed the regulations. John Cridland of the Confederation of British Industry has said that the Government have made a number of sensible changes that will help to keep down administrative burdens. Trevor Dixon, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, has welcomed the approach that the regulations take. As the regulatory impact assessment shows, we estimate that the changes that we have made as a result of the consultation should save business some £200 million in potential costs without jeopardising the benefits of the minimum wage or protection for workers in claiming it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister told the Committee that he estimates that two million workers will benefit directly from the application of the minimum wage, can he now tell the Committee how many people he estimates will be rendered unemployed as a result of not being employable at the rates required by the national minimum wage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman. He has not so far during debates on these issues fallen off the deep end as a complete right-wing ideologue, but that is the most stupid question that I have heard. Since the national minimum wage was announced, tens of thousands of new jobs have been created in sectors such as hospitality. Since the minimum wage announcement, 400,000 new jobs have been created and unemployment among young people and the older unemployed has halved. The latter group was left on the scrap heap by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The minimum wage has been good for employment and will continue to be so. I will make the business case for the minimum wage and set out in spades why that is good also. I was going to say that all Committee members have welcomed the minimum wage. However, as the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that that is not the case, I think that I will scrub such a remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Business regards the minimum wage as making good business sense. Low wages do not make sense, as they lead to a vicious circle of low morale, low performance and low productivity. That damages the capacity of small and medium companies in the local marketplace to receive or retain contracts for goods and services because they are competing not on the basis of quality, but by undercutting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A prime example is a contract cleaning company in my area, which pays its workers well: they receive more than £3.60 an hour. The company trains its workers, gives them qualifications and allows them time off to go to college. However, it must compete with an employer who is paying £1.10 an hour, and so loses contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That anti-competitive practice is additional to matters of social justice raised by the minimum wage. In a flexible economy, employers must not be allowed to achieve advantages over their competitors in the marketplace through a cycle of continuing low pay. That is why an overwhelming number of employers now support the national minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poor morale is a real cost: estimates from the Confederation of British Industry indicate that absenteeism costs British businesses up to £25 billion a year. That is 10 times more than the estimated impact of the minimum wage on the wage bill, which is £2.4 billion. Wages mean that resources are going into the economy—especially local economies—and that money is spent on local goods and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £2.4 billion figure is not a loss to the British economy, but represents an extension or gain to it. With that come goods and services, especially from small and medium companies, which work almost exclusively in their own local areas. Such companies exist against a background of lack of purchasing power for low-paid workers and people who are on benefit as a result of the failure of Conservative policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff turnover and recruitment are a real cost and a real burden in the low-pay sector. The London School of Economics estimated recruitment costs in 1997 and 1998 at £150 to £700 per vacancy. Some low-paying companies have employee turnover rates of 130 per cent. per year. That is equivalent to the whole work force disappearing every year, along with a third of the new work force. As a result, training and recruitment are continuous. That is a huge burden, which is caused mainly by the low morale and commitment to companies that results from low pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Low pay is a massive burden on employers. The minimum wage will help to lift that burden and give employers a better opportunity to make a return on their investment in their staff. It will also help to improve the quality of goods and services supplied to customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members should not lose sight of the significant, long-awaited benefits that a large number of low-paid workers will receive for the first time. Such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
workers include pieceworkers, agency workers, cleaners, caterers and security guards. We heard many stories of outrageously low rates of pay in those sectors when we debated what was to become the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. The regulations are designed to deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum wage is part of the broader picture for ending low pay and attacking poverty. It forms an integral part of our overall strategy to promote work incentives and make work pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workers will benefit in April from the minimum wage. Many will benefit again in October, when the working families tax credit comes in. It will guarantee that every working family will have an income for full time work of at least £190 a week. The tax credit will include a new child care credit up to £150 a week for families with two or more children. There will also be a generous disabled person's tax credit which will provide a guaranteed minimum income of at least £150 a week for a single disabled person who moves from benefit to full time work earning the minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are significant steps to end in-work poverty and I cannot for the life of me understand why there is so much opposition to the proposals from Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister remind the Committee that the cost to business of the working families tax credit is estimated at about £100 million a year, yet it will make no more difference to the income of the vast majority of recipients than family credit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another example of the Tories weaving—perhaps I should say spinning—a cloud. Under the Conservatives, low pay cost employers millions in tax take which went into the benefit system to subsidise low-paying employers. Good employers had to compete against low-paying employers and to shell out tax in subsidies to them through the benefits system. That is not economic sense, never mind social justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government have already put in place the lowest tax regimes for companies. Corporation tax is 30 per cent. or below—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am happy to allow a wide-ranging debate on the national minimum wage, but I will not allow debate on various other tax measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you say, Mr. Olner. I was making a bid to become a Treasury Minister. It is the accent—I sound like the present Chancellor, although I may not look like him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have spent much time taking thorough consultations on the regulations. I am not making excuses: I made it clear during the Bill's passage through Parliament that there would be qualitative consultations and that we would reflect as broadly as possible on any anxieties and issues raised. I shall refer to those matters later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Since 18 June 1998 there has been no doubt about the rate for the minimum wage and the date of its introduction. A survey carried out by the Hong Kong and Shanghai banking corporation showed that many employers have already increased wages in advance of the minimum wage. The report also stated that when firms acted to pre-empt the minimum wage there was no evidence of higher costs leading to price increases or large-scale job losses in those companies. There is evidence in spades to counter the argument of the hon. Member for Daventry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Regulations will inevitably be complex in some places because they need to cover the great variety of working and pay arrangements. For example, they must cater for pieceworkers at home and in the factory, people who work on commission, workers who are in seasonal employment and workers who do long or unusual hours, as well as their employers. That is where the complexity comes in: life and work are sometimes complex. In this respect, these regulations are no different from other areas of employment law which must cover exceptional as well as standard cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can, however, assure the Committee that for the great majority of businesses and workers who operate on the basis of regular work patterns, with regular pay, the regulations represent a straightforward approach, in line with the definition of pay and working hours recommended by the Low Pay Commission in its report published last June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Government are committed to ensuring that employers are aware of their obligations and that workers are aware of their rights under the minimum wage. We have decided to spend some £5 million on telling people about the national minimum wage in the run up to 1 April and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like clarification. The Minister mentioned a moment ago that a helpline had been set up. The West Midlands Low Pay Unit states, in a communication dated yesterday, that it understands that the helpline has yet to be set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand that, because 3,000 inquiries have been made to the helpline in the past week. It is open seven days a week. Perhaps it was so busy that those concerned were not able to get through. The helpline is definitely open and the relevant material is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The helpline is giving preliminary guidance and answering inquires on the overall scope and effect of the minimum wage. It is being used by employers and employees. Most of what is said is about the practicalities. It is not a matter of whether people are for or against the minimum wage. The helpline staff are effectively providing information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, subject to the approval of the Committee and the House, the regulations are passed, my Department will issue detailed guidance and shorter leaflets designed for employers and workers. Specific arrangements are also proposed for people from ethnic minority groups with different languages and people with disabilities. A range of tools will be available for informing businesses and employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked businesses what they wanted in such guidance and we have aimed to produce that. We sought advice from the key sectors, where the minimum wage would make the biggest impact, about types of information and presentation and the materials and vehicles to be used to convey it. There is no point in providing information packs without involving those with whom one wants to communicate. The process was worth while for the organisations concerned and officials in the Department. The materials produced are the better for the consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the Minister's recitation about the marvellous consultations, I wondered whether he nevertheless, regrets the way in which the draft regulations came out? Does he agree with the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) with whom I engaged in a debate about au pairs last week, who said that excluding them from the regulations was merely good, practical common sense? Would not it have been wiser to exercise good, practical commons sense before issuing the draft regulations, rather than putting everyone through the hoops of the consultation process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be coming to au pairs in a moment. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that we do not excuse ourselves or apologise for what are in my opinion the most comprehensive consultation documents to be produced on any legislation, by any Government. The consultation process is intended to allow the Government to set out their intentions and to ask people about the principle, the practicalities and whether there might be another, better approach that would not damage the principle. If that is not consultation, we do not have an elected parliamentary democracy. We have improved on the practice of the previous Government. Our consultations are genuine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. St Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I cannot stay for the whole debate and I am not a member of the Committee, but I should like to point out that on the very day that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced that au pairs would be excluded from the regulations, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), was writing to an hon. Friend of mine to say that they would be included. That clearly demonstrates that the Government did not consult in the way that the Minister describes. They make up policy on the hoof and, at the last minute, they do U-turns as if there were no tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman again talks nonsense. The Government have done no U-turns on any aspect of the orders. We shall consider au pairs in a moment. It is interesting that Conservative Members want to speak about au pairs, not hundreds of thousands of low-paid contract cleaners—they will ask for exemptions for nannies next. It is pure self interest. I have to hand it to the Tories: they not only oppose the minimum wage, they get—to the nitty gritty—to ensure that their personal circumstances are unaffected by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's throwaway remarks, I make it clear to the Committee that I have never, to my knowledge, employed an au pair or a nanny to care for our children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never been an au pair although my accent is almost Swedish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department is developing a package of literature including CD-ROMs and case studies. We are carrying out workshops and seminars, that are aimed especially at small businesses in the low-paying sector. After discussions with the Department, the National Hairdressers Federation is organising a range of advice seminars across the country about the way in which hairdressers should implement the minimum wage. That organisation should be congratulated. It has been prepared to go out and sell the minimum wage, and help people to implement it. That sort of spirit is currently abroad. It is a good spirit, not a mean spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall talk about some of the key issues that emerged from the consultation, and the action that the Government intend to take. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), who is about to leave, may want to listen. I am about to talk about subjects in which he may be interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxieties have been expressed about the accommodation offset. Its value can be counted towards the national minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission recommended that it should not exceed £20 per week. The regulations reflect that recommendation. The Government have asked the Low Pay Commission to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the minimum wage and to report by December 1999. We have no plans to change the current offset. However, in view of representations, we have asked the commission to examine and give advice on accommodation offset, as it will on other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now consider au pairs. The hon. Member for Daventry has a smile on his face for the first time today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I should clarify, for the avoidance of doubt, the position of work that is done in a family context. The regulations provide an exemption for work undertaken by people who work and live as one of a family in their employer's home. That could, for example, include many au pairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear, however, that the exemption applies only if the worker is treated as a member of the employer's family, especially in the provision of accommodation and meals, and the sharing of tasks and leisure activities. If au pairs, or any other workers, live in their employer's household but do not enjoy the benefits of being treated as part of the family, the national minimum wage will apply. I believe that that approach is balanced and family friendly, and encourages fair treatment of workers in the home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chidgey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the regulations provide for exemptions on the basis of the au pair's age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the normal rules will apply to age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister realises that the Opposition welcome the Government's exclusion of au pairs from the minimum wage. We made such suggestions. However, counsel in the House of Lords, and those in the Library who examined the matter were surprised that the Department of Trade and Industry had found a loophole in the tightly drawn Bill. Defining work rather than workers as different is the key.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister absolutely satisfied—and will he pay the difference, if not—that if people take on an au pair for two years under the normal system but the courts find that it is illegal, the Government will compensate those employers for having broken the law? Any court of law examining the way in which "work" has been redefined in the English language as it has in the Bill might find that the provisions are not within the spirit let alone the letter of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman goes back to his own point of order, but the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has given these measures a clean bill of health in terms of status and standing. The hon. Member for South Dorset could help the Committee by advising us whether he is intending to pay his employees—including his house worker to whom he referred extensively in the debate on the Employment Relations Bill—the national minimum wage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman already knows the answer. Paying £15 for less than four hours' work is well within the national minimum wage; and holiday pay is provided as well. I am pleased that the Minister clearly said worker rather than female worker because my employee is male not female.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pretty near the bone—the hon. Gentleman is a bit of a skinflint. It is not as though he earns only an Member of Parliament's salary. What of all his other little jobs? Perhaps he could give one of them to one of his workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The position is similar to that of a family member who lives at home and does household chores or works in the family business. We are talking about work that is done strictly within the family context. The employer must be a member of the family—an incorporated company does not count—and the member of the family must be living in the alleged employer's family home. If, in those circumstances, the family member does household chores or helps out with the family business, that work will not count as work that must attract the minimum wage. That is a sensible approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that none of my hon. Friends in this Committee has ever employed an au pair, but many Labour Members will be breathing a sigh of relief that they are not being implicitly accused by their own Minister of employing cheap labour—now that au pairs have been excluded—because some of them have employed au pairs in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset? In a debate last week, I was promised by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Margaret Hodge) that I would receive an answer from the Minister's Department about whether the ruling on au pairs was bomb-proof in relation to EU directives and legal changes—but I have still not received that critical reassurance, which I would have expected to receive before this afternoon's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assurance lies in the scrutiny that has taken place of whether the proposals are vires or not vires—and they are vires. The hon. Gentleman can try as many tricks as he wants, but he will not delay the introduction of the minimum wage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Olner. I have had clear advice that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments looks as best it can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That point has been discussed, debated and deliberated on many times before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Olner. I was advised by parliamentary counsel that it is for this Committee to decide whether these provisions are legal and that we cannot rely on the Standing Committee to make such a ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I advised earlier, the provisions were considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and found not to be defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
We decided not to proceed with a requirement for employers to provide a statement of the minimum wage on every pay slip. It is preferable to wait and see whether that should become necessary in the light of experience. In any case, employers will find it in their own interests to ensure that their staff know about the minimum wage— in order to avoid confusion and unnecessary disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department is including in the guidance a model poster, which I hope that employers will want to display at the workplace. That seems a sensible approach and I believe that good employers will adopt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to ensure that workers are aware of their rights and employers of their obligations. We recognise that the Government have a role in that process and the national minimum wage provisions require us to publicise the minimum wage—an issue referred to by the hon. Member for Guildford. We are spending around £5 million to ensure that people know about the national minimum wage, who can receive it and when it commences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided to require employers not to keep specific records but to keep sufficient records instead. It will be left to the employer to judge what counts as sufficient in the first instance. We considered the issue carefully, because some businesses told us that they would welcome knowing precisely what records should be kept, while others told us that they wanted a light touch. As a result, the guidance will contain advice on the sort of records that might be regarded as sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a sensible starting-point. It should not reduce protection for workers, because they will still have a right of access to records if they believe that they do not receive the minimum wage. In the event of a dispute, it will still be for the employer to prove that he or she has paid the minimum wage, rather than for the worker to prove that he or she has not received it. It will still be an offence not to keep records or to keep or produce false records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In providing for annualised hours and term-time workers, we recognised that special rules should apply for workers who receive an annual salary in regular payments but who work irregular hours at different times of the year—for example, workers who work only during school terms but are paid a regular amount through the year. Representatives of employers and workers confirmed the need for such rules, which we have devised for the regulations. The effect is to treat annual working hours as though they were evened out across the year, reflecting the evening-out of pay received. As a result, it should not be necessary for employers or workers to restructure existing arrangements. Both the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress have welcomed that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have shown that the Government have taken pains to listen to responses, and have adjusted the regulations when appropriate, without reducing protection for workers or affecting the integrity of the minimum wage. As a result, I am confident that the regulations will achieve our main aim—the elimination of unfairly low pay—with minimum knock-on effects and disruption to existing arrangements. The cost, as estimated in the regulatory impact assessment, is confined purely to the impact on the paybill, at around 0.6 per cent. of the total United Kingdom paybill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I hope that I have said enough about setting the rate of the minimum wage, which will be £3.60 for those aged 22 and over; £3.00 for those aged 18 to 21; and £3.20 for those aged 22 and over who are undertaking accredited training in the first six months of a new job. In that respect, the regulations also define what counts as accredited training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also define what counts as pay the definition is broadly in line with the Low Pay Commission's recommendation. It is absolutely essential to do that, for the sake of certainty and to ensure that the rate amounts to the same thing for every worker and employer. The starting-point is gross pay, including, for example, incentive payments or bonuses as well as tips paid through the payroll. Accommodation can be counted, up to a maximum of £19.95 per week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tips must be paid through the payroll to count towards the minimum wage. Tips that are channelled through informal systems whereby, for example, a troncmaster, rather than the employer, pools and redistributes the tips himself, will not count towards the national minimum wage. The system must be properly monitored—the Regulations encourage that. Tips received outside the payroll will not count, towards the national minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also define what counts as hours and the calculation of hours and workers' rates of pay. I hope that I shall be able to answer hon. Members' questions and that, ultimately, when we have passed the regulations, people will feel satisfied that the Government have done a great deal of work to ensure that the minimum wage is implemented effectively, with maximum support from industry, including both workers and employers. To that end, I commend the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.9 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, Mr. Olner, I welcome you to the Chair. The members of the Committee meet quite regularly in this Room to debate employment legislation; for the first time, we do so under your chairmanship. I also thank you for clarifying the complexities of debating two orders. To avoid doubt, I shall primarily address myself to the main regulations; indeed, I shall have to do so to remain in order. I shall probably touch only slightly on the other regulations, but I shall not feel it incumbent upon me to make a second speech. However, my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset may wish to do so, and I shall listen carefully to what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister to our debate. As the House has decided upon having a minimum wage, we share his wish that it should be implemented as smoothly and effectively as possible. It is good that we are able to debate the orders, but we have reservations about the structure of the debate because we are, perforce, not allowed to amend the regulations. This is the last throw before the legislation comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern, which may be considered in a wider context, is evident in the response of businesses—not within the Department's consultation loop but outwith it. The process of developing the minimum wage has not been continuous like the development of a new car model. From Second Reading to today, it has been a stop-start
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
process, with periods of consultation or consideration in Whitehall. The regulations will come into force in four weeks' time, with the ink, at least metaphorically, hardly being dry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that we debated the general issues of the national minimum wage fairly extensively last year. It would certainly be inappropriate for me to wish to reopen those debates. Nevertheless, since the National Minimum Wage Bill passed into law, the Department is on its third Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are delighted that the Minster of State is still at the Department; he is part of the scenery—and a necessary part of the old Labour front, which accompanies the new Labour front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I a not a member of old Labour but a member of little Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, Mr. Olner, I have the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that a number of modifications have been made, most of them welcome. However, although the regulatory impact assessment appended to the regulations makes the assumption that the continuing compliance costs will be as near to zero as makes no difference, it also assumes a direct increase in labour costs of £2.4 billion. The Minister dwelt on a recent survey undertaken by HSBC, which said that many companies have adapted to that, and that many of them have anticipated the changes. However, the impact is differential; it is often concentrated in sectors of an industry or in different industries rather than being spread across industry in general; it will depend on the pattern of pay in those industries. It may have particular effects on different firms or sectors, and the firms in the greatest difficulty may hold out until the last moment before they make any changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his interesting remarks, the Minister also said that the orders would not result in money going out of the British economy. That is perfectly true; it will be redistributed within the British economy. It was interesting to note that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry opined the other day that he is now more interested in wealth creation than in redistribution, so we must consider whether the national minimum wage is likely to support wealth creation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that low-paid workers, in their endeavours for a company, help to create some of that company's wealth? They simply do not get a fair share of that wealth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard that argument before. I hope that companies will pay workers as well as they feel able to do, and as well as their work justifies. However, there are some economic problems. I am conscious of the time, because I know that other hon. Members will want to speak before we conclude our first debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
By any token, the figure that I mentioned will have a significant economic impact on business turnover. It will be accompanied by other changes that the Government are making. The Government calculate that the so-called stealth taxes and regulatory interventions will amount to a burden of £40 billion on businesses over this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often consider that regulation is a secondary stream of taxation. That is certainly how business people see it. It tends to be particularly regressive, almost more regressive than the national non-domestic business rate, because it tends to impose a greater burden on the smaller business. It has heavy compliance costs and, as the papers for the National Minimum Wage Bill showed smaller businesses tend to pay less and find it more difficult to pay higher rates. The regulations would particularly impact on smaller businesses, which are the lifeblood of future expansion in the labour force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has helpfully instructed the Low Pay Commission to consider the longer-term impacts of the process, although I concede that it will be quite difficult to tease out the precise economic impact of the proposals. I do not think that we shall go from the saloon bar, with firms making a meal of declaring some demonstrative redundancies; indeed, I would advise them not to do that. But I have no doubt that the regulations will impose a toll on businesses and on jobs. I am sure that the studies that the Secretary of State has commissioned will tend to show that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be a little more concrete about the real-world effects of what is proposed in the regulations. When debating the National Minimum Wage Bill, Conservative Members constantly warned that a minimum wage could not do justice to the complexity of the economy and the multifarious employment arrangements within it. I acknowledge that the Minister of State worked constructively on that Bill, particularly in relation to voluntary workers, but the regulations will still hit traditional charities hard, especially those that cater for the socially excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State may be aware of correspondence from the Leicester Childrens Holiday Centre that was sent to the Prime Minister's office. Every year, that charity takes about 350 disadvantaged people to Mablethorpe. It wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we cannot have a stage in between the full national minimum wage and the volunteer basis the cost to the charity will be crippling and we might well have to consider whether the Charity could continue to be viable."</p></blockquote>
That is a disturbing but not, I fear, unforecast consequence of the rigidity of the minimum wage. The Minister needs to see what, even now, he can do about such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case is eloquent about the real economic and social costs of the regulations, which must be compared with the rather bloated claims for social justice that Ministers have made. I say that because, undoubtedly, the greatest single beneficiary of the proposals will be the Chancellor of the Exchequer; as the Minister has conceded, he will be clawing back a proportion of benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the regulations make progress in shaving down the cost of implementation and are much better than they were at the pre-consultation stage. I do not always
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
accept compliance cost assessments, but the Minister's estimates of £125 million a year on the current costs and £85 million on set-up costs are plausible. Any reduction is welcome to business, but it pales into insignificance compared with the direct economic costs which, by definition, are likely to be incurred by the most vulnerable sectors of employers. The situation is analogous to the Minister picking my pocket, taking my cash and credit cards and then—after a due period—thoughtfully returning the wallet with a request that I thank him for the flexibility and consideration with which he removed my cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole process needs to be viewed and tested alongside the Prime Minister's reported remarks to the meeting of European socialist parties yesterday in Milan. He called on Europe to be more like America and urged other European leaders to adopt the culture of free enterprise and deregulation. However, as Graham Mackenzie of the Engineering Employers Federation said in response:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He seems to be saying one thing and doing something else. The message he is trying to give Europe is about entrepreneurialism and freeing labour markets while at the same time your average small engineering company is being buried under a tide of legislation and paper".</p></blockquote>
The same could—indeed, is—being said by thousands of hairdressers and small hotels. That is Opposition Members' primary concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade and Industry Ministers are very good at telling businesses how to do their job: in the words of the former Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), they have to "sharpen up their act". However, they are not so good at running their own show. The clearest possible example, already referred to by my hon. Friends, is that of the au pair sector. Although we thought of most relevant topics in our debates last year, that one passed us by—it came to light only at a later stage, after exhaustive debates in Committee. Two weeks ago, the Secretary of State finally rescued himself and his Ministers from severe embarrassment by exempting most au pairs from the provision—but on virtually the same day as his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) said that they were included and a few days before his Department issued guidance to such organisations as activity centres that au pairs would be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government sought to explain those anomalies away in another place by saying that the guidance was only preliminary and that we needed to wait for the definitive guidance. The preliminary guidance, which contradicted the Secretary of State, has been withdrawn. However, we do not yet have the definitive guidance; as far as I know, all the guidance has been pulped. I do not know whether it will be issued over the next four weeks, which is when the regulations came into force and people have to get their act together and decide what the regulations mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what the Minister said, in his accompanying notes and in our debate, it seems that in solving the au pair problem he has gone further and virtually exempted family workers living in the same house. If that is so, it answers one of the points that we made at some length—
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
and at a late hour—in Committee on the potential for embarrassment in the employment of spouses, for example, not so much in terms of payment as in the event of a marital breakdown, when it might be used as a weapon in the family argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also disturbed that the Minister has been so coy about giving a clear assurance on the proclaimed relaxations that he and the Secretary of State have made and that matters such as coverage, record-keeping and weekly pay slips will not fall four of a legal challenge for no longer meeting the stem criteria in the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. You were right to remind the Committee, Mr. Olner, that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments considers the vires of such issues. You and Ministers and their legal advisers will know that a mere certificate from the JCSI does not guarantee successful litigation in the courts. As my hon. Friends have said, it would be seriously embarrassing if such a case were brought and the entitlement of au pairs and of others had to be reopened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that small businesses may still not have the foggiest idea about the detailed operation of the national minimum wage system. I am sure that the Minister wants to try to address that problem and that the measures that he mentioned today will do that to some extent, but we have a long way to go. The two statutory instruments before us, which run to almost 40 pages, are unlikely to help that much. I invite the Committee to read regulation 37(2), for example, where the words "work", "worker" and "working" are mentioned eight times in one jumbo sentence of 101 words. I do not understand what it means and I am not sure whether the Minister of State does, but I am certain that anyone trying to run a small business will find it difficult to understand. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State is perhaps more confident than I am about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dwell on the point, or make it in irreverence to the Committee, but one of the first casualties of the system was the Crown Estate, which advertised a residence at Windsor rent free, but on the conditional acceptance of certain obligations to work. I do not need to make a judgment about whether that was a satisfactory arrangement in the past, but the national minimum wage has blown it out of the water. The somewhat meagre daily accommodation allowances are insufficient to recover the situation. I do not know what will happen now, but it is back to the drawing board for the proposal. If the Crown Estate, which is well advised and sensitive, is unable to get it right first time, it is extremely likely that that body will be one of many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman is confirming my point. The truth about the regulations and the history of the national minimum wage is simple. Ministers are very good at giving press releases. They believe that once they proclaim the new Jerusalem it will—or already has—officially taken place. Any reservations that we may have on economic costs or administrability are discounted until the very moment when the Government run into a politically indefensible

case. Ministers then backtrack hastily and try to claim credit for their alleged flexibility. They must hope against hope that those who have read the small print and understand the regulations will not use them too literally to take aim at small employers whose ignorance and the economic stress of running their businesses causes them to trip up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers must hope that the economic consequences of the measures are too opaque to pin the blame on them. We shall make our protest in due course. The regulations will set the seal on the legislation, but Ministers, employers and, ultimately, employees will be left to face the consequences in the loss of jobs and the loss of illusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.29 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chidgey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to say that the Minister has treated us to one of his most expansive speeches—almost a bouffant performance. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If any hon. Member wants to intervene, I am more than happy to give way. I was about to congratulate the Minister, because I know that the minimum wage is dear to his heart, and it must be important for him to debate it now in committee. He claimed that he was not so much old Labour as little Labour. Perhaps the best term is little old Labour; it suits him very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know—his colleagues will not; they did not stay up most of the night on several occasions as we did—that the Liberal Democrats support the minimum wage. We disagree about its method and style and about who it will apply to, how and where, but we have never disagreed with the concept. So my speech will be brief; I shall deal with the specific issues that arise from the regulations
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the regulations on employers' records have been simplified. That will ease the burden, especially on small businesses. We long argued for simplification in Committee, and I am glad that the Government have moved on that issue. We can rightly claim to have had crystal-clear vision—with foresight, rather than hindsight. However common sense is now needed on how to proceed with the regulations. Perhaps this debate will show us how the Government will deal with the Employment Relations Bill, which we have been debating in Committee in this Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are still complex and detailed, and the language used is legalistic. Those employers who do not have the resources in their administration and management systems will find the regulations difficult to understand without seeking and paying for professional assistance. That problem will affect small firms especially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister waxed eloquent on the amount of consultation that he has undertaken. I have no reason to doubt what he says, but there is still a lack of communication and some concern at the different ends of the spectrum—from the Engineering Employers Federation at one end, to the west midlands low pay unit at the other. None of us lives in a perfect world, and it would be wrong to assume that the Government's consultation process is complete in itself and clear to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
To ensure that the national minimum wage is introduced positively, it is vital that the guidance that the Department of Trade and Industry issues is clear and straightforward and that it is published as soon as possible after the regulations are approved. That will help because little time is left between the publication of the guidance on the regulations and their implementation on 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly said that it was clear in June 1998 what the minimum wage would be and when it would be introduced. Despite that—human nature being what it is— it is also clear, from the feedback from industry and commerce, that large numbers of employers and employees are unsure about what is happening and when the national minimum wage will be introduced. The Government have a yard to go before they complete the mile that is the task that they set themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the publicity campaign is under way and that the Government are spending £5 million on it, but the feedback—I am sure that tit is unbiased—from the seminars that the Engineering and Employers Federation has held in the past few days shows that not one of the firms present knew when the national minimum wage would begin. In no way do I mean to accuse the Minister of being wrong in saying that the Government are taking steps; I am merely saying that more needs to be done, is he satisfied that sufficient resources have been allocated for that campaign?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Criticisms have been fed back to me that only small field support teams, staffed by people from the Inland Revenue and from the Benefits Agency, have been made available to promote the message. The Minister said that people did not know about the helpline because it is permanently engaged. I realise that he was being jocular, but it is a serious point. If that is the case, we need more resources to man those helplines, so that employers and employers can be clear about their rights and duties. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is interesting that hon. Members who have not taken the Bill through its various stages over the months and years feel able to comment from a sedentary position without contributing to the debate, but I shall pass over that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Judging by the experience of the wages councils, the success of the national minimum wage is dependent on three main factors—first, widespread dissemination of information on entitlement and rights; secondly, enforcement of the legislation; and, thirdly, effective action to prosecute employers who flout the law. There is also a fourth factor—the monitoring and modifying, if necessary, of the national minimum wage itself, recognising its effectiveness for employees, which we welcome, its impact on business, which is a cause for anxiety, and its possible impact on jobs, of which the Government were aware when they set differential rates for different age groups. I am therefore still slightly disappointed that the Government have not confirmed that the Low Pay Commission will be a permanent body responsible for monitoring those three things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems extraordinary that the House can debate in great detail and read in-depth reports about introducing a minimum wage, while we must protest to have just three hours to discuss the regulations. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Government have decided on a minimum wage; the Committee will not change the thrust of their proposals. However, the regulations are important and need to be watertight, so that, in obeying the law, as they must, employers are not challenged on matters that are not properly covered in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took advice from counsel in the House of the Lords, and I am sorry to say that we were at odds in describing what this Committee may do and what the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments may do. The latter checked whether the regulations are in order. When it did so, it did not find a problem. Counsel made it clear, however, that this Committee may take its own view about whether a matter is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other hon. Members, I welcome the fact that the Government genuinely consulted a wide range of people, and seemed to listen to the points made by hon. Members to try to ensure that the minimum wage was directed where the Government intended, and that unforeseen consequences would be eliminated wherever possible. The National Minimum Wage Bill was drafted with great care to eliminate loopholes for employers or for future—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that my hon. Friend did not participate in the Committee deliberations of the National Minimum Wage Bill, but I draw to his attention the fact that I and several of my hon. Friends offered the Government opportunities to provide relieving powers, which, almost without exception, they declined to widen during our consideration of the Bill in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the Bill came back to this House from the Lords with clauses that would have allowed the Government to do what they are doing now. In an extraordinarily ingenious way, the Government are trying to change the English language to get around the criteria that were set down and which were not allowed to be varied by regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read the regulations, I thought immediately, perhaps for the wrong reasons, that they were ultra vires. It seemed that the Government were relying on the regulatory powers in section 4 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 to change section 3 of the Act. However, I discovered that the Library had been told that the Department of Trade and Industry was using section 2(3)(a) of the 1998 Act to determine what was work. The Act has made it watertight that the Government cannot redefine workers to exclude au pairs. At the end of sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act that deal with regulatory powers, it is repeated for the benefit of clarity that
	<br><blockquote><p>"No provision shall be made under this section which treats the same circumstances differently in relation to—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) different areas"—</p></blockquote>
I assume that that means foreign areas as well as the United Kingdom, but importantly—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) different sectors of employment;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>undertakings of different sizes;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) persons of different ages; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) persons of different occupations."</p></blockquote>
Under the heading of "standard occupational classification", the Library has a definition of what is meant by different sectors of employment. The definition
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
of au pairs is No. 659 and comes under the general heading of "Other Childcare and Related Occupations". It states that an au pair is a person of different occupation and that it is a different sector of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draftsmen in the Department of Trade and Industry were so ingenious that both the Library and counsel considered, on their initial consideration of the matter, that the DTI had got it wrong. Instead of defining a different sector of employment or trying to get away from the measure before us, the Department used section 2(3)(a) of the 1998 Act, which is a regulation—making power on the basis of workers who are being paid the minimum wage. It allows the Government to work out the
	<br><blockquote><p>"circumstances in which, times at which, or the time for which, a person is to be treated as, or as not, working, and the extent to which a person is to be so treated".</p></blockquote>
That section determines the hourly rate of remuneration, but the Government have used it to exclude an entire sector of employment—au pairs living within the family home. Au pairs are not mentioned in the regulations, which give instead a set of circumstances. The defence used is that the regulations are not defined to cover every au pair because some au pairs will fall foul of the detour in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are making regulations under section 2(3)(a) in a part of the 1998 Act that has nothing to do with defining what is, or what is not, work. That is where the drafting is ultra vires. Anyone who has worked as an au pair for two years should take the matter to court. I hope that the Minister will confirm that he personally, or perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer who may have a few more pounds than the Minister—indeed, the Minister may be the Chancellor at the time—will reimburse employers who have relied on what is a defective power. People are relying on a power that does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To further exacerbate the problem, someone going to court in two years' time to try to get the minimum wage will be able to read the press release that the Government issued when they came up with the ingenious camouflage about not dealing with au pairs. The press release mentions a group of workers like au pairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) said that it was a matter of common sense. In our debate on 25 February 1999, she said that that group of workers had been excluded for good commonsense reasons. They probably were, but unfortunately they are not legal reasons. Conservative Members are urging the Government to do something for au pairs, but they cannot do it using defective legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have a sneaking feeling that my daughter is currently residing in his constituency, so he had better be nice to me, as she might take exception to him if he is rude.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for keeping the debate on the straight and narrow, Mr. Olner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that I am not trying to pervert what he should do. The Government can change the draft regulations, even if we cannot in Committee. They have to be draft orders because we are making one order on the basis of another that will be made 24 hours after it has passed through both Houses. It is okay to discuss making an order even though the other order has not yet been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to make the regulations because they are appropriate and sensible, but I regret that we do not have sufficient time to debate them properly or to debate their constituent parts in detail, in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent part of Sunday reading the regulations. I know that people might ask "Haven't you got a life?"—I often wonder that. At first glance, I saw that we would not have time to debate every regulation. However, I should be grateful if the Minister would address a couple of problems when he winds up the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem was found in regulation 8 on the meaning of payments. Sub-paragraph (b) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any payment by way of a pension, by way of an allowance or gratuity in connection with the worker's retirement or as compensation for loss of office"</p></blockquote>
will be excluded from the minimum wage.

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. At the start of our debate, I called the Committee's attention to the fact that we were considering the draft National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999. Members have been speaking to those regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Olner. I realise that the Minister will need time to wind up this debate. My remarks, which interlink between the two regulations, would be better made in the second debate. I therefore conclude my remarks and ask the Minister to respond. I shall not spend much time on the next order, but I can speak in more detail about those items that I have just commented on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about there having been three Secretaries of State. It is rather like waiting for a bus: one waits 18 years for a new Secretary of State, then three arrive almost at the same time. However, I have managed to cope with the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about taxation and deregulation. We could go on for some time swapping statistics, but according to a recent survey by KPMG, the United Kingdom has lower taxes on business than Germany, France, Japan and the United States. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about matters European; and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister spoke recently about the United States. The United States has had a minimum wage since the 1930s, but President Clinton recently proposed a federal minimum increase of $1 an hour in the minimum wage over the next two years. When it was last increased, millions upon millions of new jobs were created. The US economy has a great deal of experience in implementing a minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Daventry made a more serious point about charities and religious communities. The hon. Gentleman was right; we spent much time trying to get all-party consensus on the matter of people who work for charities, but we excluded genuine volunteers. No genuine volunteer is included in the national minimum wage: they are all excluded. However, low-paid workers who work for charities are not excluded. That is what the minimum wage is about. That is supported by charities and religious groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have been supported by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Community Service Volunteers and other major charities. We shall be sitting down with the charitable and religious sectors to give them special guidance about how they should implement the national minimum wage. We have also been flexible in other respects. For instance, homeless individuals who volunteer to work for a charity will be explicitly excluded form the minimum wage. We have worked hand in glove

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; I am conscious of the time.

We need not debate that further now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman.

The hon. Member for Eastleigh raised a number of issues. I assure him that the guidance will be user friendly; it has been written with the organisations and reflects their views on what they want it to contain. It will be simple, but effective, and we shall provide various methods of drawing on it. Of course, that service will be free, so no small business need pay for advice on how to implement the minimum wage. The DTI is prepared and willing to provide that advice. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that we must issue common-sense, clear guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall ensure that resources will be available to maximise the use of the helpline, which will be open seven days a week. No one knows about the peaks and troughs in its use, but its work load will increase significantly when the national publicity campaign commences and people seek information, help and advice.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Dorset cleverly continued a discussion that we have had before. I have explained, with extreme clarity, why the Government issued the regulations in this way. We did so after consultation. Any difficulty would have been picked up in the review of the regulations. No difficulty has arisen, so I have confidence in the regulations. I know that the hon. Gentleman will not agree with me, but that is a matter for him. I have received legal and other advice as a Minister, and I am confident that the regulations will be effective and that they will conform to the 1998 Act. We are not in the business of creating loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Gentleman for suggesting that I can be ingenious with the English language. No one has ever said that of me before, and I accept the compliment in the spirit that it was meant. If he wants to write to me about
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
any matter, I shall correspond with him. My job is to ensure that the minimum wage is implemented effectively, and I will go to great lengths to ensure that it is. We have had a good debate and many important issues have been raised. In my opening speech, I gave a full explanation of the Government's intentions, so I hope that the Committee will now agree to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The second set of regulations has a narrower scope, in that it will give the Secretary of State the power to prevent certain classes of people, aged 26 or more, from qualifying for the minimum wage. We are considering the merits and drawbacks of giving the Secretary of State the power to exclude specified groups from receiving the minimum wage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The slight problem is that the titles of the draft instruments are the same. I hope that I can draw my remarks to an end in a spirit of some co-operation.

This narrow order would enable the Minister to carry out the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999. Regulation 8(b) of those regulations excludes pension or redundancy money from the payments for the purpose of the minimum wage. A group of workers in my constituency have reserved office employment within the Ministry of Defence. An individual who takes redundancy from the Ministry can put down his or her name for a reserved occupation. Part of the payment for that reserved occupation is made in the pension. The regulation might work to the advantage

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
of such individuals, but perhaps the Minister will consider that matter with his colleagues in the Ministry of Defence to find out what the position will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that regulation 13 effectively excludes new dealers from the minimum wage regulations? In the past, the Government have tried to make it clear that they want people employed under the new deal and the subsidised jobs regulations to earn a proper wage for the job. An employer can receive £60 of subsidy for them, but it is not intended that the trainee would receive only that amount. However, regulation 13 excludes younger people who are studying for national vocational qualifications from receiving the minimum wage for six months. I do not think that the Government necessarily intended that to happen—or perhaps they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regulation 19(1)(c), I am confused, as other members of the Committee will be if they read it. It seems that an employee staying on at the workplace to do an evening class, perhaps run by the local technical college, after the employer had asked for volunteers to do so—an employer will often say to an employee on low wages at the start of his or her career, "You go to night school in your own time and I will pay for it"—would, under the regulations, be deemed to be working. However, an employee who voluntarily attended the same training course at the local technical college, similarly provided by the employer, would not. Even if no other work were taking place, an employee attending a course held at the place of employment would be caught by the hourly regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other, extremely important, issue is the wording of regulations 30 to 37 on what remuneration can be excluded from the minimum wage. The normal definition of wages is the amount paid before statutory stoppages; I think that we would all accept that tax or national insurance paid on top of the minimum hourly rate of £3.60 should be the employee's liability. However, the regulations do not allow an employer to discount statutory deductions before paying the minimum wage to an employee. I ask the Minister to reconsider that, because it seems to provide that the minimum wage is £3.60 after statutory deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was my understanding from having read the regulations for a few hours on a Sunday. I am disappointed that we have so little time to discuss them and it was strange that the enabling power was discussed second, not first. However, I am most grateful for the tolerance that you have shown me, Mr. Olner, in allowing me to make my points, which I hope the Minister will take in the spirit in which they were made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for South Dorset for his contribution. His point on pensions and reserved officers was a fair one; if he writes to me, I shall clarify the position. I am not dodging the issue, but I am not certain whether a reserved officer who is employed as a non-civilian in the armed forces is covered by the minimum wage regulations. If the person were not an officer but a civilian, the matter would be covered by his terms and conditions of employment. If the hon. Gentleman writes to me about the specific case, I shall respond fully, frankly and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The hon. Gentleman also raised issues about accredited training under regulation 13; the regulation is important because it clarifies the rate for those who are on the new deal. It does not cover those who are not on the new deal because we do not want to encourage training that is poor or ineffective or which is a means of getting round the payment of the minimum wage. We are trying achieve a balance between increasing the quality and effectiveness of training and encouraging employers to take people on and train them to high standards and the provision of the national minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised issues that should properly have been debated under previous regulations; nevertheless, I shall respond to him. Elements of pay that could also be excluded are overtime and shift premiums, allowances that are not consolidated into basic pay, the provision of tools, a uniform or other equipment needed for doing the job. That is fair and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also essential to define what hours count when the minimum wage is payable, a matter to which the hon. Gentleman referred. In general, the times when a worker is at work and required to be at work will count, as well as time taken travelling or training during working hours. That is only fair. Employees in such circumstances are under the employer's control and direction, and what they are doing related to their employment. They will therefore be covered by the minimum wage. That is important for employees on, for example, zero hour contracts without such definitions. Such exploitation could otherwise continue. It is generally accepted that the way in which we define the hours that count for the national minimum wage is reasonable and sensible, and has the support of the business community, as has the way of calculating a worker's hourly rate of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues that the hon. Gentleman raises are important, but because we shall provide quality information and guidance for employers, any anxieties about those matters will quickly evaporate. Our work with employers is designed to help them and give them advice, as are the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In working with employers, we have a responsibility to ensure that the training that is provided is quality training. One of the side-effects of the introduction of the minimum wage and the regulatory regime relating to trainees will be to give a big boost to quality training and effective training as they will clarify what constitutes training and define quality. A significant amount of work involving employers' organisations and the Department for Education and Employment has gone into the regulations that deal with training to ensure, for the first time in the United Kingdom, clarity in defining quality of training. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will—I am sure that employers will—find the regulations that deal with training helpful in driving up the quality of training and defining who can receive the minimum wage during training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
