	<p>	<b>The Committee met at a quarter-past three.</b></p>
	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Aberdare)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a few remarks on our general procedure which may be helpful to the Committee. The procedure is as far as is possible the same as for a Committee of the Whole House. Your Lordships should speak from a standing position and observe the same degree of formality as we do in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of proceedings this afternoon is being made from a tape-recording. Therefore if you would please try as far as possible to talk into a microphone it would help the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a Division in the House it is for the Committee to decide whether we adjourn for a fixed time or until the result off the Division is known. Previously we have found it best to adjourn for 10 minutes and I would recommend that arrangement if Members wish to divide when the Whole House divides. Members of the Committee are, however, fairly equally divided between the parties and may feel that it is not necessary to go to the Division of the Whole House. If they do wish to attend, I would recommend that we allow 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the function here of the Chairman of Committees? Is it the same as the noble Lord on the Woolsack and no more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is exactly the same. He has no control over Members at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do noble Lords agree that it would be appropriate to adjourn for 10 minutes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Noble Lords</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we have a Division in this Committee the doors are locked six minutes after the Question has been put and challenged unless all Members of the Committee are present. A Division in this Committee will be broadcast throughout the House on the annunciators and Strangers are not required to leave the Committee Room when a Division is called. Six minutes after the Question has been put, or when all Members of the Committee are present, the Chairman will say, "Lock the doors". As soon as the doors are locked he will put the Question for the second time. If it is still challenged, the Clerk will read out the names of Members of the Committee and each Member will reply either "Content", "Not Content" or "Abstain". Then the Chairman will announce the result of the vote in the usual way, the doors will be unlocked and we shall continue with the Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a Member of the Committee abstains, is that abstention recorded in 	<i>Hansard</i> or any other record of these proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would think not. The record will be exactly the same as it is for normal voting procedures in the House. For the purposes of taking the vote here, if the Member is present he should simply abstain to indicate that he is not wishing to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the programme of sittings, today it is proposed that we should sit until six o'clock this evening and thereafter from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. tomorrow and Thursday. Next week we shall sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Do Members of the Committee find that agreeable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. This is a punishing regime. I believe we are entitled to some explanation as to why we are being given this strenuous task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unusual for a Committee of this kind to be set up. It is the first that I have experienced in the 18 years I have been in this House. It is customary in another place for the Committee itself to have some discussion on the convenience of the programme for Members and on the accompanying circumstances of the Committee stage. In that way at least Members would have some say as to what we are being asked to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the rush? Are we expected to finish this Bill before Christmas? Are we going to sit in Christmas week? I believe we are entitled to know what the plans are and be given an opportunity to discuss them before we agree to anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee sits is entirely for Members to decide. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, that it is a fairly unusual experience, but we have held Committees off the Floor of the House before and it has been found convenient to sit in the morning. The consensus that we have taken through the usual channels has been that it would be more convenient to sit in the morning rather than having our business clashing with the business in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proposing that we sit from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., but it is entirely in your Lordships' hands if you wish to differ.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a good deal of sympathy with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Houghton. What concerns me is that we have a bit of an overdose with three mornings a week without first seeing whether we make more progress than is evidently feared. We had no notice of this before and suddenly we are to have three days in one week. I, for instance, would find tomorrow very difficult, and I hope that we might try two mornings a week rather than three and see how we get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether any member of the Government would like to say a word about this but we are anxious, as I understand it, to get the Bill through and the arrangements have been made so that we can avoid sitting in Christmas week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would hope that the recommendation, if recommendation it is, from the Lord Chairman will be accepted. I certainly understood there had been some form of informal discussion through the usual channels as to what time this Committee should meet. Ten o'clock to one o'clock is not an unreasonable regime. There is general agreement—or maybe there is no general agreement—that to make decent progress with the Bill, and given the number of amendments that have been put down, this is necessary. What is being proposed is in my judgment reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a relatively new event; admittedly it does not set a precedent because this has been done before. Frankly, whatever is suggested is inconvenient to somebody somewhere, but it at least gives us the advantage of being able to sit three days running. Sittings are only for two and a half hours and it is not as if they will run from three o'clock until the end of the day. I have no doubt that if indeed we found that the work was expedited, we need not sit the last day. This pattern is desirable. I am sure it is in everyone's interest to try to get the Committee stage over by Christmas. Whether we do is entirely up to your Lordships, but I support the noble Lord, Lord Harris, in hoping that we will be able to keep to the recommendations which have been canvassed through the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support that. This is a Bill which everybody who spoke on Second Reading thought desirable to have enacted. I took the view when I was asked about this that it would be a good idea to get the Committee stage out of the way if at all possible before the Christmas break. To do that we may need six sessions, we may need five or we may need more than six. To aim at this stage to have six sessions, one this afternoon and thereafter two this week in the morning and three next week in the morning, seems to me desirable, and I support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the balance in the Committee is that we should sit in the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another point I wish to raise. In this House, unlike the other place, noble Lords who are not Members of the Committee may attend, speak and move amendments. Therefore, those who are not Members of the Committee but who come in to pursue their own business here can in a sense be in control of the time of the Committee. They can speak for as long as they like; they can introduce as many amendments as they like. The Chairman cannot stop them; and here we sit, like a lot of prisoners waiting for others to do their business before we can get on with ours. What is the function of those who are not Members of the Committee? They can come and go. They have no responsibilities here; but we have to stick it out. Is this what experience shows to be desirable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Lord Chairman replies to the noble Lord, it occurs to me that we need to know what is a quorum of this Committee. Presumably the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
quorum will be composed only of those Members of the Committee who have been nominated by the House to serve on it; the quorum could not include those who have decided to come in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on my feet, may I raise another point? You, my Lord Chairman, pointed out that we shall of course be bound by the usual rules of procedure of the House. But it is one of the courtesies rather than a rule of procedure that the order of speeches should enable each of the parties to be heard and that no one party should deliver three speeches and then another party deliver two speeches. We go across the Floor of the Committee. Observing the geography of the room and the way that the seats are occupied, it would seem that that arrangement will be somewhat blurred unless a better way is found of distributing ourselves. Bearing in mind that the House has appointed a rough balance between Government and Opposition, it would help us to observe the courtesies if Members who are supporters of the Government were to sit on this side of the Committee and Members of the Opposition were to sit on the other side, and those few of us who are Members of the Cross-Benches were to to sit at the Cross-Bench table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that much will depend on your Lordships' good sense, as it does in the House. I do not think that we should try to split ourselves up into various groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One other point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just answer the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, I am afraid that if one wished to change the arrangements one would have to go back to the Procedure Committee. All we are doing is putting into effect the rules governing Public Bill Committees and I can only try to do what we have done before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quorum is three and only the names of Members of the Committee are called out, so it will be three of the Members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can now move on to the Bill; otherwise we shall spend so much time on these points that we shall never get on with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Young of Dartington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it permitted for a noble Lord who is not a Member of the Committee to ask a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Young of Dartington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it turned out that noble Lords did not accept a specific amendment, would it be up to the proposer of the amendment to decide whether to press it to a vote or would that decision have to come from a Member of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision comes from the voices collected by the Chairman from the Members of the Committee. So it is up to the Members of the Committee whether they wish to accept or reject an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that quite answers the noble Lord's question. If one is not a Member of the Committee, presumably having argued
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
one's amendment the moment then comes for the proposer of the amendment—the person whose name is at the head of the amendment—to put it to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I apologise. I did not quite get the point. It is up to the proposer of the amendment to decide whether he insists upon it or withdraws it. However, it is up to the Members of the Committee when the voices are taken how they treat it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall we be sitting in this funereal room all the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a glorified funeral parlour, and some of us are rather tired of looking at the mythology of the Old Testament around the room. You can never get away from Moses. We have been looking at him for 18 years when we have come in this room and it is about time he delivered the Ten Commandments. There is no fresh air, there is no ventilation and there is no natural daylight. Do we not have a Committee Room where we can open the windows and see outside or wander in the corridor? This is quite shocking when you consider what accommodation is now being provided for Members of another place. We are confined to the traditional conditions under which this House appears to have sat for the last century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could just remind the noble Lord that it is the Charities Bill, and I suggest that he speaks with a little bit of charity on this. We are here in this building. It is a very agreeable building, and the noble Lord need not look at the picture opposite him so much. He can always concentrate his mind on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or even sit on the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we might start with the Bill now. The title has been postponed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 1 agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Young of Dartington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No.1:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause:</p>
	<p>	<i>("Role of Charity Commissioners</i></p>
	<p>.In section 1 of the Charities Act 1960, for subsection (3) there shall be substituted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In order to strengthen their role the Commissioners shall (without prejudice to their specific powers and duties under other enactments) have the functions of—
	<ol>
	<li>generally fostering and supporting charities;</li>
	<li>encouraging charitable giving;</li>
	<li>drawing attention to needs which could be more fully satisfied by charities;</li>
	<li>advising the Secretary of State on the policy, including taxation policy, which should be adopted towards charities;</li>
	<li>drawing attention to the good practice of particular charities from which others could learn;</li>
	<li>promoting the effective use of charitable resources by encouraging the development of
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
better methods of administration, by giving charity trustees information or advice on any matter affecting the charity and by investigating and checking abuses." ").</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The noble Lord said: I should like to begin by reading the subsection of the Charities Act 1960 which this amendment seeks to deal with. I think it is the only section of that 1960 Act which deals with the general functions of the Charity Commission. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners shall, without prejudice to their specific powers and duties under other enactments, have the general function of promoting the effective use of charitable resources by encouraging the development of better methods of administration by giving charity trustees information or advice on any matter affecting the charity and by investigating and checking abuses".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>To my mind at any rate the case for the amendment is fairly straightforward. The Bill as it stands has, it appears to me, an unduly negative cast to it. Anybody who came wholly afresh to this scene might easily imagine that charities are riddled with abuse and that a Charity Commission is needed in order to check that abuse.</p>
	<p>The Explanatory Memorandum of the Bill starts by saying that its whole focus is to strengthen the role of the Charity Commissioners. However, it then goes on to say that it will do that by extending their existing power to investigate charities and to check abuses. The first new Bill on charities for 30 years should not have such a complete emphasis on abuse as that, important though it is. The role of the Charity Commissioners certainly needs to be strengthened but not just so as to increase their regulatory powers. There is surely an old-fashioned pre-Thatcher assumption here about the role of the state which is being buried in the Bill; it is that organs of the state are to regulate and nanny enterprise, not to foster it.</p>
	<p>The Government have in other of their policies recognised that charities have a far more important part to play in a modern society than they used to have. They have been helped by tax concessions and by government grants. Charities are being seen as partners both by the state and by private business, so is it not anachronistic that the Charity Commissioners as the chief and chosen instrument of government policy should be cast here just as a regulatory body? Let the commission be associated with the general run of charities which are doing a good job and not with the field of abuse. Let it be the friend and supporter of charities and it will be of much more use to society. If it were not just a policeman but also a friend and comforter of charities, I think its necessary regulatory functions would be more readily accepted.</p>
	<p>So to the detail of the amendment. It starts with the statement taken from the Explanatory Memorandum about the general objective, which is to strengthen the role of the Charity Commissioners. Then comes paragraph (a), which is the first addition to the clause. It would give the commissioners the function of generally fostering and supporting charities and make it quite clear that their function was to do this in general and not just in relation to any one particular charity which might call upon their help.</p>
	<p>The second function, which would be a new function, or at least stated here for the first time if it got through in an Act of Parliament, would be to give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
them the function of encouraging charitable giving. I think that they would speak on this subject—obviously a very important subject—with an authoritative voice in support of the Charities Aid Foundation, the NCVO and other bodies which are already promoting charitable giving. The commissioners could give advice to solicitors who are helping people draw up wills; they could buy some of the giant European foundations like Volkswagen, Agnelli and others which may extend their sphere to Britain after 1992, and they could also do the same with many great North American foundations.</p>
	<p>In many other ways too they could lend support to all those who are trying to increase the amount of charitable giving there is so that the charities that exist now and the charities which might exist in the future would have more sources with which to work.</p>
	<p>Moving on to paragraph (c), the function here would be to give the commissioners the power to draw attention to needs which could be more fully satisfied by charities than they are at present.</p>
	<p>The new Chief Commissioner of Charities, who has made such an excellent start, spoke recently in a lecture named after Lord Goodman about the far-sightedness of Joseph Rowntree who set up a charity which had as its general objective the relief of poverty. He pointed out that the shape that poverty takes and the kind of needs that particular poverties give rise to are constantly changing and need to be scrutinised, and that there is always a need for new ways in which old purposes can be served. I think it would apply to many fields of charity as it would be of very great value to society if the commissioners had a function to point to gaps in what is at present provided.</p>
	<p>Paragraph (d) speaks for itself. If this function were operative all charities would have a spokesman when it comes to taxation and other policies, and I am sure that most charities in the country would greatly welcome it if they thought that the Charity Commission was acting in this way on their collective behalf. Paragraph (e) could mean that the commission had a particularly useful role in spreading good practice and not go in the other direction from what we hope it will do in checking abuse. It would seek out good practice—it will hear of good practice anyway—and let other charities know what that good practice is so that they may consider whether they wish to adopt it.</p>
	<p>Paragraph (f) only repeats what is already in the 1960 Act and I think that if this amendment were accepted it would be necessary to repeat that. This is my submission. I beg to move.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like in principle to support this amendment very much and it is pure chance that I happen to be sitting next to the noble Lord, Lord Young of Dartington, because we not disposed as we normally would be; but I would like the Committee to think that this support, coming from the Back Benches of the Conservative Party rather than from his own party, shows that there is an across-the-Chamber view on this particular point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Young of Dartington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how very much I appreciate what the noble Lord said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I supported this on Second Reading when I heard it for the first time. I believe the idea is excellent and I believe that it is important the Charity Commissioners should have a somewhat wider vision of their role than they have in the 1960 Act. It is important that they should promote charities rather than just be seen as a regulator and nothing more. I do hope the Committee will therefore give the principle of this, if not the text, all the support it can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should confess, as my noble friend Lord Ferrers said at Second Reading. I have a responsibility with regard to the 1960 Act but that does not close my mind to improvement. Indeed, I welcome the Bill as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I greatly appreciate the work which the noble Lord, Lord Young of Dartington, like other noble Lords on this Committee, has done in helping charities. I wish I could go along with him in supporting this amendment. If I may say so, it seems to me good in parts, and I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I go into some detail in considering it. But, taking it in the broad, I am very much afraid that if we added this to the law it would cause confusion, controversy and some doubts in interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the detail. Let me take each of the paragraphs in this new subsection in turn. In Paragraph (a) the word "fostering" is innocuous. I certainly would not object to it. The word "supporting", however, has certain implications. If the Charity Commission, which has no financial powers—it has never been voted money for paying out to charities—was asked to support charities in general or in particular, a controversy would arise at once as to whether its support was to be financial, which is what so many charities are seeking, or what other kind of support it would be? I should be chary of having the word "supporting" put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Encouraging charitable giving" is fairly innocuous. It is something which the Government do anyway and which Chancellors of the Exchequer—especially the present Prime Minister when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer—have made provision for by giving really great incentives in charitable giving (for example, in the Finance Act of, I think, 1989) to enable anyone who gives anything from £800 to £1½ million to deduct it from his general taxable income. That is very supportive and encouraging of charitable giving. As I say, paragraph (b) is fairly innocuous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am very worried about paragraph (c):
	<br><blockquote><p>"Drawing attention to needs which could be more fully satisfied by charities".</p></blockquote>
Where would the priorities lie? There are vast numbers of suggestions that could be made and we enter in then to the realm of party political discussion and, indeed, controversy as to which needs should be more fully satisfied by charities, which should be less fully satisfied and so on. That is not something which I think the Charity Commission should be asked to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We should bear in mind, if I may mention in passing, that the members of the Charity Commission and those whom they employ are nearly all civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then I come to paragraph (d):
	<br><blockquote><p>"advising the Secretary of State on the policy, including taxation policy, which should be adopted towards charities". That is the only paragraph in the subsection which I would be broadly in favour of. But I rather doubt whether it is necessary to state it in the Bill. I consider, rightly or wrongly—I stand open to correction—that this is something which the Charity Commission could do in any event at present.</p></blockquote>
We then come to paragraph (e):
	<br><blockquote><p>"drawing attention to the good practice of particular charities from which others could learn"</p></blockquote>
I think that is inviting a comeback. "Particular charities" would mean named charities. If it were to say in its annual report, in very broad terms, that there are some charities which have a good practice for doing this and that, and that it is a pity some other charities do not follow it, that would be all right. But for us to have it as part of statute law that specific charities should be mentioned from which others, the lesser brethren, should learn is something which we should somehow try to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore come on to paragraph (f):
	<br><blockquote><p>"promoting the effective use of charitable resources by encouraging the development of better methods of administration".</p></blockquote>
Innocuous down to there, but they are then invited to go on,
	<br><blockquote><p>"by giving charity trustees information."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust the noble Lord, Lord Renton recognises that these words are copied out of the 1960 Act? They are not something new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the first part of that, as I say, I find innocuous; but they are to have a responsibility or function—which is the operative word—of,
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving charity trustees information or advice on any matter affecting the charity."</p></blockquote>
May I say that I have a great deal of charitable experience. I have been to the Charity Commission and I have sometimes asked it questions and requested information. I have sometimes sought advice and I have sometimes had it, but there appeared to be no obligation on the part of the very limited staff to give that information or advice. By all means let us hope that it will be in a position to do so, but—I hope that this is not a diversion from my main argument—it really does need to have a large increase in staff and an increase in the training and quality of the staff if that is to become a statutory obligation—"a function", as the opening words of the new sub-section state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is all linked up with resources. It may well be a good thing that the commission should do this. It already has the power to do it and it attempts to do so, but whether we should make it an obligatory function is another matter. Of course, in regard to investigating and checking abuses the commission already has the power and, indeed, the duty to do so. Therefore, it is doubtful whether we need to write those words into the Bill by means of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I have great sympathy with the motives of the noble Lord, Lord Young, in this regard and it is with some reluctance that I feel obliged to express the doubts that I do, but I do think that we must be very careful, bearing in mind the importance of that part of the Charities Act—it will be at this part of the Bill—before we add it to the Bill. As I say, we want to avoid controversy and doubt to the extent that we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Young of Dartington, wanted in putting down this amendment. He gave some very good reasons why he thought it should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said he thought that the Charity Commission should not be too much of a policeman and ought to have a rather softer image. I think that the Charity Commission has to be a policeman but in the same way that police in normal life are friends of the community, though periodically they have to take action against them. The Charity Commissioners will act in a similar way in regard to their responsibilities. They will be friends of the charity world but periodically they will have to take action against some people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Renton made a clear exposition, if I may say so, of why we would also have doubts about having these words in the Bill. My noble friend said he thought it would cause confusion, controversy and doubt. I think that is correct. I think that some of the functions of the Charity Commission should not, as he said, be made obligatory. Of course, the amendment would give the Charity Commissioners a number of functions which are additional to those which are specified in the existing Section 1(3) of the 1960 Act, as well as elsewhere in the Act and in this Bill. I do not think that these extra functions are appropriate to the commissioners and in some respects they could give rise, as my noble friend said, to a conflict with the commissioners' existing statutory responsibilities which are essentially those of supervision and regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first duty which the noble Lord seeks to give to the Charity Commission would be that of generally fostering and supporting charities. That sounds very reasonable, but of course the commissioners' discharge of their functions as a whole contribute to the support of charity in general and the charitable sector in particular by enhancing public confidence in the effectiveness and accountability of charities. I think that a specific duty to foster and support charities does not sit easily with the commissioners' duty to take firm and even harsh action in respect of particular charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph (b) he seeks to encourage charitable giving. Again, if public confidence is enhanced, people will be encouraged to give to charity. Once again I do not think that it would be appropriate to give the commission a specific responsibility to encourage charitable giving as this implies that it ought to promote charitable giving. That is something which I think is best done by the charities themselves and by their supporters. The Government play their part by providing fiscal incentives and new ways of giving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
such as gift aid and payroll giving. The Government in fact give substantial sums of money to charities—some £2.4 billion in all and £800 million in tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point the noble Lord made was to draw attention to needs which could be more fully satisfied by charities. My impression is that the charitable and voluntary sectors are very good at identifying and meeting new needs. We have only to look at the number and diversity of charities concerned with AIDS which have come into being in the past few years. The Charity Commissioners' area of expertise does not extend to what is not being done by charities, as opposed to what is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord also seeks to get the Charity Commissioners to advise the Secretary of State on policy, including taxation policy to be adopted towards charities. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and his colleagues will of course always take into account the experience and expertise of the Charity Commissioners when they formulate their policies towards charities. That is inherent in the Home Secretary's relationship with the commissioners and with their general role and functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is shown up by the example of the commissioners' involvement in the preparation of the White Paper and indeed on this Bill. Of course, we will always invite their contributions but in the end taxation policy is a matter for my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, that does not mean to say that charities and the Charity Commission cannot give their opinions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the suggestion that the Charity Commission should draw attention to the need for good practice of particular charities from which others could learn. The commissioners issue and will continue to issue guidance on good practice in matters which are within their remit. Would not a general duty to advise on good practice be going too far and too wide? In our discussions we have mentioned the development of self-regulation within the charity world to complement the statutory regime. Spreading examples of good practice is very much a part of that. While I understand the point of view of the noble Lord, Lord Young, I take the same view as my noble friend Lord Renton that it would be wrong to put a statutory obligation upon the Charity Commissioners to do much of the things which the noble Lord wishes to be done, many of which in fact they do at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are making pretty heavy weather of this. It seems to me that my noble friend Lord Young proposed to set the general aims and purposes that the Charity Commission should be expected to assume. The noble Earl tells us that we do not need paragraph (a) and we do not need paragraph (b). The commissioners are doing this already. The obvious answer to the obvious response of the noble Earl is "If they are doing it already, why on earth should it not be in the statute book"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the terms of the 1960 Act. Indeed I think the whole of paragraph (f) of my noble friend's amendment is taken word for word from the Act. There cannot be any objection to that because it is already in the statute. The Government are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
proposing to amend that part of it. So there is a statement of general aims and principles to which the Charity Commission should attempt to live up. I am bound to say that I do not have any great problem with the majority of these paragraphs. The one that there might be a little difficulty with—perhaps it should be a matter of more solicitors' drafts—is paragraph (c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so sorry to interrupt the noble Lord but there is a Division in the House. May I ask the Committee whether it wishes to adjourn or would Members prefer to carry on? We will adjourn for 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.58 p.m.</p>
	<p>[	<i>Division in the House</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord resumes, may I say that I was under a misapprehension regarding paragraph (f). I had overlooked the fact that it is simply a repetition of what is already in subsection (3) of Section 1 of the Charities Act 1960. I apologise for making that slight mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the noble Lord is absolutely right on the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention now to paragraph (c) of my noble friend's amendment, which I think could be drafted more felicitously. I hope that my noble friend is not totally wedded to the wording of the amendment, so that what we are talking about is the thrust of it rather than the actual wording of each subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is one fundamental point here which my noble friend brought out and which I should like to support. Do we see the function of the Charity Commission as being greater than that of merely regulating the way in which charities carry on, or should it not in this new era which one assumes will be ushered in by the Bill have a more positive function in the future than it has had in the past? In a sense, it has pursued a more positive function, although it may not have had statutory cover for it in the past. It has done many desirable things to encourage and promote charities, although technically the 1960 Act does not impose that duty upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my noble friend is prepared to look again at the drafting, I find myself in agreement with the thrust of the amendment and I should be prepared to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What worries me is the practicalities of the amendment. We agree with many of the recommendations in the amendment, but it would need another department of the Charity Commission, which would mean more staff and accommodation. When I was dealing with the Small Charities Act 1984 I was worried at that time. I know that things have changed, but there are 275,000 charities in the United Kingdom and nearly 160,000 organisations are on the Charity Commission's register according to the report from the Woodfield Committee. It seems to me that at the moment the Charity Commission has a great deal to do in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
regulating charities in this country and unless there is more money forthcoming to do the extra work this is not the moment at which to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect the sincere and persuasive way in which the noble Lord, Lord Young, moved the amendment, but I too have been much concerned about the resources of the Charity Commission. We shall have more to say as the Bill goes through. We are adding new duties and there must be some anxiety whether it will be able to discharge those new duties satisfactorily. To add still more in the way suggested would raise serious doubts about its competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking back historically, it is interesting that up to 1960 there were exclusively lawyers in charge. Since then we have had a non-lawyer chairman. We have recently added two outside part-time members of the board and I think they will increasingly come to discharge some of the functions which are set out here, such as advice on policy, without having to write anything into the Statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to elaborate. I am nervous about paragraphs (b), (c) and (e), and the risk of getting across the activities of the NCVO and the Charities Aid Foundation and some of the other voluntary bodies. Although I sympathise with the object which the noble Lord has in mind, I do not think that this draft is acceptable in the form in which we have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would on the other hand like to support my noble friend. What we have in his amendment is a series of opening aims and objectives for the commissioners which would give them, as my noble friend Lord Richard said, statutory cover for what they are already trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may offer a parallel. I was for many years the Chairman of the Museums and Galleries Commission, which was charged with looking after advising the Government on all matters to do with museums and galleries. One of the objectives which we were given from as far back as 1930 was that we should support the aspirations and encourage the efforts of those who aspired to become public benefactors. It was a lovely, quaint old phrase, which served very frequently to remind us of a duty which it was all too easy to forget when one was concerned with matters of legislation; and this in the head and face of this Bill would give the commissioners a reminder that they can be and should be not reactive and neutral but proactive. It has a positive virtue in making them not simply policemen but also, to some extent, social workers. It gives them the opportunity to be self-propelled and puts the onus on them to keep the charity in public view and in the public arena.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the wording of certain of the paragraphs might be more felicitous, but I am quite sure that I support the general positive thrust of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Harris of Greenwich: I intend to speak briefly on this amendment. I have doubts, as indeed do the noble Lord, Lord Richard, and the noble Lord, Lord
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Allen of Abbeydale, about paragraph (c), which I do not think is satisfactory. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Young, will consider that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the central question for us is what do we see the Charity Commission as being. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said that he saw it as being an agency of supervision and regulation, and having sometimes to take what he described as firm and harsh action. I agree with that. But I would not be content if at the end of our consideration of the Bill we left it at that. I hope that we would see the Charity Commission as having a far more positive role. Certainly as far as some of the specific paragraphs in the proposed new Clause, I see considerable advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Renton, has doubts about paragraph (e). He said it was inviting a comeback. Well, no doubt sometimes there might be, but I do believe that the idea of giving some advice on good practice would be extremely helpful to charities as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be helpful for the commission to have a certain responsibility drawing matters such as social policy to the attention of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, of course, would not make a final determination of the matter, because that is a matter for the Chancellor. Nevertheless, it does seem to me that many of the provisions of this proposed new clause would be of considerable value in changing the character of the condition and making it a far more positive organisation. Having said that, I do have some slight doubts about one particular subsection which I hope very much the noble Lord, Lord Young, will look at again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this amendment is entirely misconceived. It is not the function of the Charities Commission to promote charitable work, or to encourage charities—historically and in practice it has been for the regulation of charities by scrutinising, supervising and checking abuses. After all, nearly all these bodies originally were set up to check abuses. It was certainly true of the friendly societies. It was true of the building societies and it was true of the trades union movement. They were all regulatory bodies that had been set up; and this is one of them. I think it would be very mistaken for us to begin to enlarge the scope of the Charity Commissioners into the field of promotion and propaganda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that you might just as well tell the Board of Inland Revenue that it ought to begin to encourage the payment of taxation, to foster taxation, and point out the directions in which much more could be done if taxation were higher and there were more of it. The Inland Revenue is a regulatory body appointed by letters patent for the care and management of the Income Tax Act. The Charity Commissioners are really appointed for the same function. So I think we have to leave alone matters of public policy as to whether charitable work and charitable participation, and the extent of charitable contribution to public benefit, is satisfactory or needs to be enlarged or encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I am surprised that my noble friend Lord Young of Dartington with his long association with the Labour movement has not understood the bias that the Labour movement had against charity when he was a boy, and when I was a boy. The idea of fostering charitable work and charitable work and charitable giving and bestowing more patronage upon the poor and the deprived, the disabled and the old—no, I was born in the last century and I know what charity was like. In the time of Victorian values it was hated. Happily, of course, the whole concept of charitable activity has been broadened and liberalised, and is more accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But charities cover a very wide area of policy and of purposes. Some people would heartily disapprove of the Pregnancy Advisory Bureau which helps people on the determination of pregnancy, helps them to get abortions and counsels them to avoid abortions. That is a charity and some people would strongly disagree with its objects and purposes. I can describe other charities on other sides of the fence which are equally controversial but they are part of the great concept of public benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No, we cannot really accept this amendment, the bottom part of it is already in the 1960 Act, and paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are really quite outwith the scope of the Charity Commissioners. As soon as this amendment is passed people would then begin to take an interest in who is a Charity Commissioner? Have we got our party on the Charity Commissioners? Is every body represented on the Charity Commission? Will the animals get a show, or will it be the children only? And so on, and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I really cannot understand why my noble friend, coming from the remote recesses of the Back Benches, has come here to move this amendment. It is utterly ludicrous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even in my brief stay in your Lordships' House I have seen several amendments which try to tell bodies in advance of knowledge what they should be doing. I am nervous about this amendment. If it was passed, would this be how the commission would be measured? If it did not have adequate resources, as my noble friend Lady Faithfull said, then would there be a commitment to add resources? It seems to me that if Charity Commissioners are appointed, they are the people to decide their priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could add a few words on this. The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, said that he thought it would be a good idea because it would give the opening aims of the Bill. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said that because the Charity Commission do paragraphs (a) and (b) already, why is it not put in the Bill? If I may say so, that is the oldest chestnut of the lot. Of course things are done, but there is no particular need to put them into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the Bill is to put into statute the obligations of the Charity Commission. To put a whole clause in giving its general aims and objectives is not right. What have to be put into the Bill are the obligations and the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
When the noble Lord, Lord Morris, says that charities must be kept in the public arena, I do not believe that that is the business of the Charity Commission. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, that traditionally commissioners have been those who regulate the charities. It is not up to commissioners to keep charity in the public arena. That sounds like a high sounding phrase and I am not quite sure what it means, because I do not see how you keep charities in the public arena. The purpose of the Bill is to give the Charity Commissioners certain responsibilities and duties. I do not believe it would be wrong if we started to introduce general areas of philosophy and put those into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Young of Dartington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most appreciative of all of noble Lords who have spoken for what they have said and for the courteous way in which they have said it. This does not mean to say that I agree, naturally enough, with all that has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, reminded me of how things were when I was a boy and I am very grateful to him for that. But the point I was trying to make
I must have made inadequately—was that since I was a boy things have changed. It certainly was the case, at least in circles in the Labour movement to which both the noble Lord and I, when we were boys, belonged and still do, that to receive charity had a stigma about it. But I would put it to the noble Lord that that kind of language and that connotation of the word "charity" as the dominant connotation no longer apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charities have earned their keep, and more, by what they have done since some of us were boys. They have changed their character. They have a most important function in society. I belong to the Labour movement—perhaps I am on the periphery now—and I am very pleased to feel that there is support now for many charities with the basic aims that have always been dear to people who belong to the Labour movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case I was trying to make was put much better than I could put it by the noble Lord, Lord Morris, and I particularly liked the form of words that he read out. We cannot quote them again but I will certainly look in the 	<i>Official Report</i> and mark them carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hope is, if the Committee accepts the amendment, that the objectives behind the Charity Commission will be clearly stated. These objectives, I believe, need to be stated and in a very positive form because there are some people, even in this Committee Room who have an outdated view of charities. I would like it to come from this Parliament that there is a new view of what charities can do and there is a positive function that all charities can perform which is now being recognised in this new legislation. I fully support the noble Lord, Lord Morris, in the way he set out what he thought the point of the amendment was except that I believe he put it better than I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were cogent objections to the wording in particular cases and also, more generally, to the whole tenor of the amendment. I thought that the particularly cogent objection came from the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, and the noble
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Baroness, Lady Faithfull. They both said that the Charity Commission could have more functions added to it if the amendment were accepted but it would need more resources in order to discharge the functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is an important criticism but I do not believe that it holds water. Any function which is given to an organisation can be discharged only within the limits of the resources of that organisation. That would apply to the Charity Commission, as to any other organisation. It would not be able to run great campaigns for charitable giving, along with Oxfam and other organisations, because it would not have the resources. It would have to pick and choose the most economic and effective ways in which these functions could be discharged within existing resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, whose experience I greatly value, made an important point about the commission, which is that non-lawyers have had a look in for almost the first time; and non-lawyers will not regard the functions of the Charity Commission in the same way as lawyers have done historically. The new people, whom I regard as very important, need to have the maximum support from outside. They represent a new strand - one which will not so much emphasise the functions of regulation as has been done in the past. I should like to feel that this Bill, even though in general terms, will add sinew to the strength that those non-lawyers in the Charity Commission already possess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, spoke as persuasively as ever, although I thought to the wrong end. He spoke about the police and the analogy between the commission and the police. With all respect, I think that the noble Earl got it wrong. Certainly, the Charity Commission has the function of the police. It is there to check abuses, which is important because the more effectively it is run the more confidence the public will have in the work of charities. I accept that. However, I thought that the case was rather undermined when it was accepted that if the police are to discharge the functions of upholding the law and checking abuse, it is also highly desirable that they should have positive functions of helping people and promoting welfare, which fortunately is a function which the police too have. The analogy then becomes very close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the commission is to continue to have police powers, as it should, and those powers are to be accepted—and the best possible staff will be behind the effort in the Charity Commission it also needs to have positive powers and functions to foster charity, charitable giving and charitable work in general. I think that there was a 	<i>non sequitur</i> in what the noble Earl said on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as all movers of amendments must, that the wording may not have been as felicitous as many noble Lords would have liked. I accept much of what has been said by the noble Lords, Lord Harris, Lord Renton, and others about specific words. I can see that there are valid objections to the wording of the amendment and that it would not be right to press it to a vote now because some people who might be for it in general would be against it because of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
phrasing of some of the clauses. I have a feeling that there might be enough support for the general import of the amendment in the Committee and later in the House to make it worth while then to put down an amendment which takes account of the objections that have been raised here. I hope that on that occasion noble Lords who spoke generally in favour of the amendment will be able to support it in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last appeal would be the customary appeal to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, to consider whether, now that the role of charities is so different and is going on to be different in the next 25 years, that it would be politic, wise and statesmanlike to accept that this Bill, since it so important, should open with a positive statement of the purpose of charities and the duties of the Charities Commission behind them. I hope that the noble Earl will, on behalf of the Government, put forward an amendment which is not open to the objections expressed here but does meet the general case expressed by me and supported more eloquently by other Members of the Committee. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>Clause 2 [	<i>Determination of status of institution's purposes by reference to its activities etc.</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 2, line 18, after ("question") insert ("shall include not only the trusts of the institutions and the activities carried out in purported pursuance thereof but shall also").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is an attempt—perhaps not brilliant as I see from the drafting—at least to make some sense of the terms of Clause 2 of the Bill. On Second Reading Members of your Lordships' House referred to the clause as being of great complexity. It is complex. But the mischief at which it is aimed is not so complex. It can be expressed in fairly short and sharp language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position, as I understand it, is that both on registration and on concluding the removal of a body from the register the test to be applied by the commissioners is whether the body is, at that point in time, established for charitable purposes only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has proved difficult to apply that test in certain cases. Doubts have been cast particularly on whether the commissioners can take into account the activities of an institution in determining whether it is a charity as well as its covering instruments. (That was established in 	<i>The Attorney-General</i> v 	<i>Ross</i> in 1986).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is unsatisfactory in circumstances where a body's governing instrument clearly indicates that the purposes for which it is established are charitable but where it is acting in ways that are not compatible with its charitable status or that are not for the public benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper proposed to make explicit the power of the commissioners to determine that a body is not a charity where it is acting in pursuit of its object in ways that are not for the public benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Clause 2 does—and what I hope my amendment does in a much simpler form—is enlarge the powers of the commission or the court to move outside the terms of the trust instrument, and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
activities of the charity under the terms of the trust instrument, and look wider at the manner and circumstances in which the general charitable purposes are supposed to be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no quarrel with what I understand the thrust and purpose of the clause to be. However, I do have a quarrel with some of the drafting. I hope that my attempt at it—if not acceptable to the Government—will persuade the noble Earl to to accept that the clause as presently drafted is somewhat complicated. I hope he will send it back for redrafting and bring it back to us on Report. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my noble friend and remind Members of the Committee of what was said by so many noble Lords at Second Reading. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, for example, found it necessary to hint gently that Clause 2, as he put it, "needs looking at". My noble friend Lord Houghton of Sowerby advised your Lordships with very characteristic directness to keep out of the Bill all contentious reference to the characteristics that constitute a charity. He advised us not to say a word about religious cults. And so it went on and on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was attempting, albeit most inadequately, to sum up the debate, I found that that point was one which came up again and again in contributions from all sides of the House. What seems to have bothered us all was the sheer impenetrability of the way that this clause has been drafted. Looking at it again since Second Reading, I think that impenetrability is caused by the verbal equivalent of what might be called arithmetical compound interest. Subsection (1) is, as it were, multiplied by subsections (2), (3) and (4), so that you get a very much larger network of possibilities and requirements than seems ever to have been intended by any one clause as it went along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are required, therefore, to ask why this degree of complexity has been found to be necessary. To what end is this complicated defence by definition being deployed? The only answer that I have been able to find—at least it was found by those who advise me—is that it is being deployed to prevent charities such as certain religious cults diverting income that they may have for wholly charitable purposes for personal gain. I think we must all agree that is a worthy aim. This is delicate and dangerous ground, though there have been clear examples—not all in the United States of America—of precisely this kind of abuse taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 2, as we have put it forward, attempts to clarify the intention to target such misdoers. It distinguishes between "trusts" and "activities" on the one hand and between "manner" and "circumstances" on the other. That, if the Committee were to accept it, would at least allow the courts and the commissioners to pursue with some degree of accuracy those who set up seemingly charitable trusts which in reality are intended to line the pockets of people whose interests are not truly altruistic and are certainly not charitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that this whole clause seems to be very much more complicated than it needs to be for that purpose, I hope that the Committee may feel able to look pleasantly upon the amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My life here and in another place has consisted of a long struggle to take a friendly view of Bills which have the Government's stamp upon them. The kind of clause which we are discussing now has made all those prolonged struggles of mine vain and useless. I find it impossible to take anything but the most baleful view of this kind of verbal garbage. No one that I have heard—people far more learned than I am—has yet said with confidence that they know what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee. Although I do not always support the noble Lord, Lord Richard, I would very much wish on this occasion to endorse his plea to my noble friend to cut short the discussion. I simply say to him, "Take it away and bring back something better at Report stage". It is not a Herculean task. No matter who puts their mind to it, they could not produce anything very much worse than this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on the unhappy assumption that we have seriously, in spite of what my noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil has said, to consider the wording of this extraordinary clause, I feel bound to say, with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, that it adds confusion to an already confusing provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say very briefly that I cannot go along with these two amendments. It seems to me that they fail to clarify the position, whatever the position may be. I hope to have an opportunity a little later of explaining why I think the clause should be left out altogether, but presumably I would be out of order if I elaborated my thoughts at this stage. I merely wanted to rise to say that I cannot support the amendment, without going into a lot of detail at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought we might have a little trouble with Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of your Lordships criticised the drafting of Clause 2 at Second Reading. I cannot pretend that the clause is easy to understand. I go along with the noble Lord, Lord Richard, in finding it difficult. The noble Lord, Lord Morris, said it was more complicated than it need be. I entirely agree. Were I to write the clause I would probably do it a lot more concisely and accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Peyton says that he took a baleful view of the verbal garbage. I think that is going a little too far. It is complicated and perhaps I could explain to your Lordships a little of the reasoning behind it. Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which Clause 2 applies; that is, the determination of whether an institution is established for charitable purposes. Subsection (1) continues by setting out the matters to which a court or the Charity Commissioners may have regard in making that determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Under the existing law the fact that the trusts of an institution are exclusively charitable is conclusive in determining that the institution is established for charitable purposes. Clause 2 is intended to change this rule. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, indicated at Second Reading in his remarkable maiden speech, there may be circumstances when, in spite of its impeccable charitable purposes, a charity is not actually being pursued for charitable purposes. He gave the example of a sole share-holding of a company establishing a tame charity so that a person might retain a control of that company while not appearing to do so. He also gave the example of the library of a club being hived off so as to enjoy tax benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 2 are included so that it is clear that 	<i>ultra vires</i> activities may not be taken into account, as there are already provisions in Sections 6, 7 and 20 of the 1960 Act for that to be dealt with. In these circumstances, the appropriate remedy is against the trustees for breach of trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the purpose of Clause 2 is to override the existing premise that a trust is a charity simply because its objects are expressed in an exclusively charitable way. The structure of subsection (2) is such as to leave no doubt that this rule is being brought to an end. It is important that this point is clearly spelt out since that is the whole purpose of Clause 2, although the other subsections are necessary to ensure that further changes are not inadvertently made to the law in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Richard, proposes amendments to ensure that regard can be had to matters in addition to the trusts of an institution. I suggest that the amendments do not clearly override the rule that charitable objects are conclusive as to charitable status. I think that what the provision as drafted does is better than the noble Lord's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (2) it is made clear to the courts and to the commissioners that even though an institution's purposes would be found to be tangible if regard was had to them solely because of the trust of the institution, they may still nevertheless look at the manner and the circumstances in which any such purposes have been, are being, or are intended to be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, might have the effect of shortening the overall length of Clause 2, which I, for one, would heartily welcome, I fear that this would be at the expense of highlighting the change in the law which will be effected by the clause. The reference in the amendments to the activities of an institution is also already covered by the concluding words of subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not tell your Lordships that this is complicated. I have wrestled with it too, and I am assured that those who are professional at drafting such things are very concerned to make it perfectly clear that it is possible for the Charity Commissioners to look at matters other than just what the trust says; in other words, the way the charity is operating or is intending to operate. But at the same time we must be
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
careful that we do not, by making this change, override powers that the Charity Commission is given in other parts of the Bill and in the 1960 Act. It is for those reasons that the wording is drafted in a more complex way than some of your Lordships might wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy for what the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has said, but I venture to doubt whether his amendments will cure the malaise of this clause. It seems to me that subsections (3) and (4) are quite inconsistent with the intention of subsections (1) and (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that there is a charity established for the relief of poverty, which is clearly a charitable purpose. Suppose that when this charity applies for registration it becomes crystal clear to the commissioners that the trustees intend to introduce into their campaign for the relief of poverty a substantial element of political propoganda, which is clearly not a charitable purpose. The Charity Commissioners would start by being seemingly bound under subsections (1) and (2) to determine that the purposes for which the supposed charity is to be established are not exclusively charitable purposes, and thus they must refuse registration. But subsections (3) and (4) will tell the commissioners that in reaching their determination they are to ignore activities which are or would be 	<i>ultra vires.</i> Political propaganda is 	<i>ultra vires</i> any charity because it is not a charitable purpose. Therefore, the commissioners must ignore the element of political propaganda and register the charity accordingly. So what purpose, I ask, will be served by Clause 2?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the noble Earl to reconsider the wording of this clause and see whether perhaps it can be improved so that we can all understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answer the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, because it is important. He gives the example of the charity which is set up with certain trusts for the relief of poverty, but then in fact it exercises its activities in a way in which political activity is involved. As the noble and learned Lord quite correctly said, political activity is against charitable objectives. The offence which the charity would be committing by indulging in charitable activities is covered by Sections 6, 7 and 20 of the 1960 Act. Therefore, the reason why Clauses 3 and 4 are put in is to ensure that those activities which are already 	<i>ultra vires</i> are not included in the new activities which the commissioners can look into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind the type of case where a charity may be set up which may have the rules drawn up in such a way as to make it pass the hoop of becoming a charity, but then conducts itself in such a bad way that, although it is abiding by the rules, the way the charity conducts itself is in fact against the charitable interest. Up until now the Charity Commissioners have not been able to do that. They have been able to take action against trusts which are 	<i>ultra vires.</i> The example which the noble and learned Lord gave would be 	<i>ultra vires</i> and those people would be caught under the existing Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The point of Clause 2 is to ensure that the commissioners can look at the ways in which people operate their trusts, but that clause must not override the provisions which are already in the 1960 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the noble Earl's statement a moment ago I think I am more confused than I was before I started. I thought I understood what I thought I was moving, but perhaps I did not. As I understand it, what the noble Earl is now saying is that if the activities of the trustees are 	<i>ultra vires</i> then they are caught by the existing legislation and that therefore it is necessary in Clause 2 to say that they are caught by existing legislation. I am not sure why it is necessary to say it in Clause 2, as I understand the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in fact, they are acting not 	<i>ultra vires</i> but 	<i>intra vires,</i> then the first half of the clause comes into play and then the Charity Commissioners presumably are entitled to say to themselves, "Now look here. Here is a trust deed which, on the face of it, is a perfectly valid trust deed. Here are these people operating within the terms of the trust hut, nevertheless, looking at the wider manner and circumstances, whatever they mean in this particular case because manner and circumstances there cannot in fact mean that they are acting 	<i>ultra vires</i> because that is already dealt with in the other half of the section, but that in terms of some general public good, or in a public interest test, although it is a valid trust and although they are acting within the terms of a valid trust, we the Charity Commission, would determine that it is not in the public interest or for the public benefit that they should be registered".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the position with Clause 2, all I can say to the Minister is that it is a mile away from the spirit I envisaged. No one has said that the clause is perfectly clear. In this respect it really is not. The noble Earl will have noticed that so far nobody around this table has said what a splendid piece of draftsmanship this clause is and how we all understand it. I am fortified in my attack on the draftsmanship by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, who chaired that committee some time ago on how to draft Acts of Parliament and how to simplify the drafting of Acts of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if he can say that he will take the clause away, look at the drafting and bring it back on Report he would be doing the Committee, the House, and indeed, if I may say so, the Bill and the Government a considerable favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I understand the anxiety which has been expressed around the Committee and I have a great deal of sympathy for that anxiety. Of course, I will be more than happy to consider this whole matter when your Lordships are concerned about it; it would be an impertinence not to do so. I cannot give a guarantee that I shall come back with a lovely, short and succinct version of Clause 2 because draftsmen do not always work that way. Draftsmen do not on the whole make things complicated if there is a simpler way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will certainly see whether it is possible to make this any clearer but I cannot give any undertaking. I accept that it is difficult, and I have tried to explain the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
reason why it is difficult. It is important to put in subsections (3) and (4) to indicate that there is no duplication of effort. However, I shall certainly have a look to see what can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has just said, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 2 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the way the discussion has gone I need not detain the Committee for very long. I have listened with care. I have read the notes on clauses. I still do not understand the clause and, although I am not a lawyer, I am comforted by the fact that I know a good many eminent lawyers who share my puzzlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read subsections (3) and (4) as dealing with breach of trust and subsections (1) and (2) as dealing with something else. I still do not quite know what that something else is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses rest on a legal decision, 	<i>The Attorney-General</i> v. 	<i>Ross,</i> which has already been referred to. As I understand it that was not a decision on whether a charity should be registered or taken off the register. It arose out of an application made by the Attorney-General for an injunction against a trade union which was contributing to a strike fund. The question arose whether the trade union was itself a charity. This seems to me a somewhat flimsy foundation on which to erect the complicated structure in subsections (1) and (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether we are dealing with the registration of a charity or with its de-registration. If the clause is supposed to deal with the registration of a charity, I would point out that every organisation seeking charitable status has to fill in a questionnaire with 44 questions dealing with, among other things, present and future activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to understand that the replies to these questions do not disclose the kind of activity that this clause is aimed at dealing with? Have we had cases in which, although the replies to the 44 questions have been satisfactory, the Charity Commission would not have registered the charity if it had had the power set out in this clause; or—and I hardly dare say this—is this some nervousness as to whether the 44 questions are in order and whether this is an attempt to provide a statutory backing for what is already the practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards revocation of a registration, the notes on clauses suggest that this is indeed the main object. I am not quite clear—and it has not yet been explained—why the Government have departed from their proposal in the White Paper that Section 43 of the 1960 Act should be amended in order to make it explicit that the commissioners have the power to remove a body from the register where there is evidence that it is acting in pursuit of its object in ways which are not for the public benefit. If the clause said that we would understand it, whether or not we agreed with the object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
One thing I find puzzling is that these non-charitable activities do not amount to breaches of trust. I still am puzzled about that. Perhaps someone at some stage would be able to explain it to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there not also a possibility that the Inland Revenue, when it looks at these activities, would disallow them for tax purposes and presumably, on the existing powers, would be able to tell the commissioners that this was what it had done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am nervous about the whole thing. There is the thought that removing a charity from a register and taking the charity funds out of the jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioners involves some problem as regards donors whose contributions to the charity lose the protection of the law because of developments over which they have no control and of which they were not aware when they were making their gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In sum, I am still puzzled to know just what the clause is aimed at, and I am very glad that the Government are prepared to take it away. I hope that if they bring it back it will be in a different form and they will perhaps be able to answer some of the questions I posed in my brief intervention this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, except that he has been much too kind to the clause. I would like my noble friend Lord Ferrers to save himself the trouble of considering how it could be improved by agreeing to take it away from the Bill altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a justification was to be sought, it would be in the White Paper on charities. Indeed, the notes on clauses in paragraph 5 on Clause 2 refer to the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper … therefore proposed … to make it explicit that the Commissioners have the power to determine that a body is not a charity where it is acting in pursuit of its objects in ways which are not for the public benefit".</p></blockquote>
The clause does not deal with that point at all; not at all. What it does is to present us with a self-contradictory set of provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may more specifically refer to the contradiction, it arises in this way. Subsection (1) puts forward a proposition which is not only limited by but is contradicted by subsections (3) and (4). Subsection (3) says unauthorised activities are not to be included among charitable objects, which are the matters to which the court or the commissioners may have reference under subsection (1). Unauthorised activities are not to be included, says subsection (3). Then subsection (4) goes on and reinforces this by saying that activities are unauthorised if they are,
	<br><blockquote><p>"not then within the capacity of the institution to carry them on".</p></blockquote>
That word "capacity" in that position in the clause is ambiguous. Presumably it means legal capacity, but it could mean administrative, physical, practical capacity; we do not know which it is intended to be. But either way it is making clear that unauthorised activities are not to be charitable purposes, and therefore subsection (1) is virtually negatived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that we should not have this clause in the Bill at all, and I hope that when my noble friend replies he
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
will confirm that he is looking at the wording. But I hope that he will leave it open to himself to agree to leave out the clause altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter that is much better left to the courts. The courts have a great tradition in this matter. They do not have a great tradition in every matter; I do not maintain that. But in this question of the development of charitable objects and their interpretation of charitable trusts, they have over many generations kept pace with the development of the public concept of charity and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There will then be a clear undertaking on the part of the Government to accept the overwhelming opinion expressed regarding its unacceptability.

I do not want to quote at length but my noble friend himself said that it was important that the meaning of the clause should be clearly spelt out.

We started with the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, saying that it is not easy to understand. I believe these were the first words he delivered to the Committee this afternoon. As the discussion has gone on I have found it increasingly difficult to understand what is behind the Government's mind on this particular question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
There was one contribution to the discussion this afternoon which in my view suggested an answer. That was the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, that the 44 questions which are put to those seeking to register a charity may conceivably not have statutory cover. That is a possible explanation but I have heard no other reason given. I should be grateful if the noble Earl would do one thing this afternoon. Will he tell us what would be lost if Clause 2 were now taken out of the Bill? That would be extremely helpful for us all because on the basis of what the Government themselves have said in their own White Paper, and with the admission of the Minister at the beginning of our discussions, it appears to be highly questionable whether we should allow this clause to remain in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe there is another reason which has not been ventilated as to why Clause 2 should not be accepted. Suppose that a charity for the relief of poverty had been set up 50 years ago by private donation or public subscription. Suppose that it performed its exclusively charitable purposes impeccably for 50 years and was duly registered under the 1960 Act. Suppose that the charity now falls into the hands of trustees who execute the trust in a manner and in circumstances which disqualify for continued registration under Clause 2. So the charity has to be deregistered under Section 4(3) of the 1960 Act. What now happens to its funds? Are they to revert to the estate of the long-deceased donor by way of a resulting trust? Are they to go to the Crown as 	<i>bona vacantia</i> and swell the Consolidated Fund, or do they remain in the hands of the trustees to do what they like with because no one can establish a better title?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obscurity of Clause 2 is so dense that I feel that the Committee ought to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the clause is difficult to understand and is clothed in obscurity, the underlying purpose is as clear as daylight. The noble Earl has concealed, and the debate has not revealed, what this is all about. It can be found in nine pages of the consultative document in May 1989, and it has to do with the most sensitive aspect of charitable work—the position of religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that I hoped we should not hear the term "religious cult" and I deeply regret that I am the first person to use it. This is a purpose made absolutely clear not only in the discussion document of May 1989 but in the Home Office brief on this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their consultative document the Government asked for suggestions for overcoming the difficulty which had arisen in connection with the Unification Church - the Moonies. It was the Moonies and the undesirable practices in which they were believed to indulge as part of the activities of the Unification Church as a charity that we heard all about. This is the outcome. I do not know the extent to which consultation took place on this matter as invited in the White Paper. But let me tell your Lordships that the all-party group consisting of members of all parties tacitly agreed that in looking at charity reform for the purpose of this Bill we would leave this entirely aside.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
We believed that it was a matter that belonged to the deeper and more contentious question of what is a charity, what are charitable purposes and what is public benefit. By common consent, this has been regarded as far too complex and contentious to bring into the Bill, and it is not part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Woodfield was not asked to look at it; Woodfield was asked to look at administration. The Audit Commission was not asked to look at it; it was asked to look at administration. This Bill is based on the reports of two bodies on administration. The day may come when Parliament will decide that it has to look further at the definition and the philosophy of charities and charitable work before going further in considering the place of charitable objects in our new society. It is a deep and philosophical question. It has connotations going back in history and going deep into the prejudices of people on all sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is public policy involved here. There is the policy of government involved. That deals with the contentious question of the provisions of the 1960 Act which stipulate that the advancement of religion is a charitable purpose. Exemptions are granted under Schedule 2 to the 1960 Act to certain religious bodies and institutions from the scope of the Charities Acts. They are regarded as being capable of sufficient integrity on self-administration and self-government as not to require the oversight of the Charity Commission. But it has grown complicated in the area of advancement of religion. The test of advancement of religion was applied in specific terms in settled cases or in settled practice. That relates to what is religious belief and what is a religion. All that has been canvassed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to the brief from the NCVO. It observes in three or four lines that it wants to see something better than this, if it is in the Bill at all. Having gone through this 	<i>ad nauseam</i> over the last two years with various bodies, I think that the best thing to do with the clause is to drop it from the Bill. It does not belong in the Bill. It should be reserved for another, separate occasion, when dealing with the deeper questions of the structure of society and the part played in it by various institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the brief tells us is that this was conceived as a result of the difficulties over the Unification Church. The Government put forward this solution in the discussion document. They have now adopted it and the brief tells us that Clause 2 is intended to apply to all charities, not only religious charities. That is the purpose of the clause. It extends the provision to all charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister cite a case of a secular charity which has activities that are so far removed from its purposes that the question of its registration arises? If so, I shall submit to him the names of four charities which have transgressed the bounds of their activities as charities in the view of the Charity Commissioners. They have been warned to pay attention to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue has an entirely separate approach to the definition of charity. One does not have to be a registered charity in order to obtain charitable relief under the income tax Acts. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue have conceded
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
nothing to the Charity Commissioners in this matter. They have an entirely separate judgment on whether tax relief can be granted to an organisation. Now a chain of communication is established and it is in the Bill also as between the Inland Revenue and the Charity Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal strongly to the Minister to face the fact that this is an ugly duckling in an otherwise agreeable and effective Bill. We shall not advance our cause one iota by going on with this clause. Until we get over this hump, it will be extremely difficult to pay full attention to anything else; and there is a great deal in the Bill of administrative importance. Based on experience of going into this question over the years and the difficulties that have arisen, I can only urge the Minister to take the clause away and not to let us see it again in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that not many of your Lordships support this clause, primarily because you have found it difficult to understand. I said on the earlier amendment that I would look at it again to see whether it could be improved. I cannot give any guarantee. But the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, said that I should take it away and he hoped that I would not bring it back. I should like to make it clear that what I said was that I would see whether it was possible to make the wording of the clause better and easier to understand. Of course, I cannot guarantee this, but I shall certainly look at it to see whether it is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Committee, and in particular my noble friend Lord Peyton, did not find this at all easy. My noble friend Lord Renton said "Don't have it in the Bill—remove it". I could not, with respect to my noble friend, agree to that—certainly not at the moment, for the reasons which I propose to give him—because this provision addresses a very important factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, said that I had no ally. A number of Members of the Committee have not spoken. My noble friend Lady Faithfull has not spoken, and she is quick to controvert the Government if she thinks we are wrong. I must say that we must take her silence as acquiescence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not spoken because everyone else has said what I wanted to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I can only say that one knows where one's friends are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a very serious point here. This arises from the issues which were raised in the White Paper about the continued status of certain religious charities which might not be said to be acting for the public benefit. We said that we would consider whether it would be possible to make it explicit that, whatever the trusts might be, whatever the legal wording might be for an institution, the commissioners should have regard to evidence that it was not actually acting in the public benefit. What the clause does is to give the courts and the commissioners the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
power to take into account the manner and the circumstances in which an institution is acting in deciding whether it should be charitable. That can be done either on registration or subsequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Harris, asked what would be lost if we left this out of the Bill. What would be lost would be the ability of the commissioners to take into account the way in which a charity was acting and not just the wording of its trust. In other words, if the wording of its trust on its own gave it charitable status but the way in which it was acting was against the charitable interest, the commissioners could take power to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, said that he did not wish to mention cults or religious cults, and then promptly did so. He asked whether there were any other secular charities which could be affected. Yes, there are. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, asked the same question. If we look back to Second Reading, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, gave two examples. He gave the example of a library or a club. A library can be formed as a charity. In itself it might be charitable and there might be no question of breach of trust arising. If one pursued it further, one could see that the library was a charity and was part of a club which was not a charity. Therefore one could say that in certain circumstances that could be a sham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another example, and again I refer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson. He gave the example of a sole shareholding of a company which establishes a charity, in other words the person may have all his money in a company and it establishes a charity. That person can then continue to control that company whether or not he appears to do so because it is in fact operating under the guise of being a charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By virtue of this clause the commissioners and the courts would be able to consider the activities of an institution—activities which may not be said to be for the public benefit—when considering whether the institution is a charity. It is important. I urge the Committee not to dismiss Clause 2 out of hand just because it is difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I will look at the wording to see if we can make it better. But it is a matter which has constantly been drawn certainly to my attention since I have occupied this position in the Home Office. People ask how it is that organisations can be charities when they operate in this way. We think it right that there should be powers in the Bill for the commissioners to take into account the way in which a charity operates as well as the legal trusts under which it is set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I hope that the Committee will agree to keep this clause in the Bill. I think it is important, and I will see if it can be made clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the noble Earl has not answered my questions about the problems arising from original registration, nor the very pertinent question which my noble and learned friend Lord Brightman asked. Having listened to all this, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that it would be better if this Bill went forward to its next

	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
stage without this clause. The Government should be put under an obligation to consider whether they need the provision at all and, if they do, whether they could put it in a way which we can all understand. If we cannot understand it, what will be the position of the small charities which are wrestling with problems of this kind? I am afraid—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the noble Lord? I have given an undertaking that I will look at this. It would be a little hard if the noble Lord were to ask the Committee to excise a clause which, having taken into account a lot of considerations and representations, we feel is important. I have given an undertaking to look at it again, and if at the next stage the Committee feels that it is desirable to remove it, then that is the Committee's prerogative. But I hope that the Committee will be courteous enough to give a stay of execution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not so sure. The noble Earl has given an undertaking that he will look at it, but has given us no guarantee that anything will be done as a result of looking at it. I do not wish to appear discourteous or unhelpful, but if the Bill goes forward without this clause it will be open to the Government to consider whether they want a provision of this kind and, if they do, to do a little better in the drafting. It has achieved no friends here and I think I must proceed with my Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Resolved in the negative, and Clause 2 disagreed to accordingly.</p>
	<p>5.42 p.m.</p>
	<p>Clause 3 [	<i>The Register of charities</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Ironside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 3, line 2, after ("charity") insert ("and related administrative Trusts").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: My fears over the wording of Clause 3 are that it gives the commission in its role as the compliance office or the regulative body too much of a free hand in the way registration is organised and information is backed. The first thing is that it must have the resources fit for the job if it is to do the things it sees fit, and it appears it will perhaps by 1995. But that is a long way ahead so there is still some degree of uncertainty around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that my noble friend the Minister can describe to the Committee in more detail how the register will work to strengthen the extent of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
information provided and whether the public as well as practitioners will have complete access to the file or only selective parts of it. In other words, will it be an open access file, and what sort of charges will be made to have access to it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment concerns a more particular point. As public accountability is to play a much more important part in charitable affairs concerning registration, auditing and reporting, I believe that it would be wise that the degree of transparency should, where possible, be spelt out in the registration. Quite a lot of it has been. But by insuring that particulars of registration should include information about the related administrative trusts, it can be seen who manages certain charities and probably in practice who has the controlling hand in them. The Bill covers information relating to the charity but not to its administration. If one reads that bit of the clause it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other particulars of, and such other information relating to, every such charity as the Commissioners think fit".</p></blockquote>
That relates to the administrative trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money is at stake and we see that stockbrokers, banks, partnerships of solicitors and other bodies provide these services. Incidentally, I read in today's newspapers that banks are now setting out on a course to make further charges on charitable account holders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. There is another Division in the Chamber. We must adjourn for 10 minutes. As soon as all Members of the Committee have returned we can continue within a shorter time if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I can say anything at this stage, but I wonder whether it is particularly sensible for us all to creep out of this room and go into the Division Lobbies where our votes will be cancelled out on either side of the question. Would it not be more sensible for us to continue here? There is an even balance of the Members of the Committee. It seems to me that that might be more sensible. I do not know what the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, feels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very engaging thought from the noble Lord. But I can assure him that not everyone in the same Parity always votes for the Government. Therefore I think that he is really suggesting that we should operate the pairing system. Much as it would be nice to be able to, I believe it would be nonsense to think that we should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[	<i>Division in the House</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Ironside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to administrative trusts. Some are foreign, or foreigners, like Credit Suisse or Phillips and Drew, and they are also foreigners. I do not know whether BCCI—the Bank of Credit and Commerce International—provided these services, but it probably did; and some charities may have suffered as a result of what happened to that bank. Also, charities and administrative trusts may not necessarily be at arm's length to each other; thus,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
by revealing this information any association can be deduced by reference to other sources. That would surely be helpful to everyone concerned, especially as the Bill, in Clause 1, is encouraging the development of better methods of administration. I hope that my amendment will provide a greater degree of transparency. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment would allow the commissioners to include in relation to a registered charity its particulars and the particulars of any other charitable trust administered by it on the register. I suggest that my noble friend's amendment is not necessary. The commissioners' current practice under Section (4) of the Charities Act 1960 is to permit a subsidiary to be registered with a main charity, and they will accordingly bear the same registered number. Subsidiary charities are those that have a connection through their objects and trusteeships with the main charity. The subsidiary charity may therefore have a common body of trustees and objects falling within the objects of the main charity, or some other distinct connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A subsidiary charity may represent a gift for a limited part of the charity's work or for supplying extra amenities for the beneficiaries of the main charity. For example, there may be a separate charitable trust for the purpose of providing, say, a swimming pool for a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This practice will remain unchanged and is unaffected by the amendments proposed to Section 4 of the Act by Clause 3. The commissioners already have adequate powers to deal with the registration of subsidiary charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Clause 3(3) is to enable the commissioners to enter in the register not only the particulars of a registered charity but also general information about it, such as whether or not statutory duties of trustees have been discharged in respect of that charity. It will therefore enable the commissioners to develop a register that will be a more effective source of information about charities and provide more information to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said I hope that my noble friend will consider that his amendment is not really necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Viscount sits down, I think he said that under Section 4 of the Charities Act 1960 subsidiary charities had to be registered. I cannot find that in Section 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first answer the point that the noble Lord, Lord Ironside, made about administration trusts. The noble Lord seems to be concerned with what would be non-related administrative trusts, which I think is a different matter. I now have in front of me Section 4 of the Act and for the moment I cannot find that reference myself, but it is there under Section 4 and I hope that the noble Lord will take my word for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, raised that matter because as the Minister was speaking I was reading Section 4 of the 1960 Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
and I cannot see a word about subsidiary trusts or a secondary trust. I do not know whether this is a practice of the Charity Commission which may need some statutory cover, which was raised in another connection this afternoon, but no doubt if I keep talking long enough the Minister will get the answer. I see that he now has it and I can now sit down so that he can tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 4(1): states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be a register of charities which shall be established and maintained by the Commissioners and in which there shall be entered such particulars as the Commissioners may from time to time determine of any charity there registered".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Ironside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand what my noble friend has said, especially in relation to the Charities Act 1960, Section 4(1), it appears that details of the administrative trusts will appear in the register. In these circumstances, having had this assurance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it is not quite six o'clock we might take Amendment No. 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 5:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 3, line 4, leave out from ("which") to end of line 6 and insert ("does not have any permanent endowment").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: We can start the amendment. I doubt whether we shall be able to finish it, but let us try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to clear up what on the face of it seems to be an absurdity in the registration of charities under the 1960 Act. If I might put the amendment in some kind of context, under Section 4(4) it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following charities are not required to be registered".</p></blockquote>
The first is exempt charities, which we are not concerned with. The second is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"any charity which is excepted by order or regulations".</p></blockquote>
Again we are not concerned with that. Paragraph (c) is what we are concerned with. The 1960 Act says that this type of charity is not required to be registered, namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any charity having neither any permanent endowment, nor any income from property amounting to more than fifteen pounds a year, nor the use and occupation of any land".</p></blockquote>
The provision continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and no charity is required to be registered in respect of any registered place of worship."</p></blockquote>
The proposed amendment puts in slightly more elegant form the substance of subsection (4) (c), and we are in this absurd position. If we leave in the provision about the use and occupation of any land, which it is sought to leave in in Clause 3(4) of the Bill, we get this absurdity. If a scout troop, for example, is in occupation of a scout hut and has an income of under £1,000 a year, perhaps £500 a year or perhaps even less than that, it will have to be registered because it is in "the use and occupation" of its scout hut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suggest that in this day and age to insist on a qualification for deregistration being that there should be no "use and occupation of any land" by any charity goes too far. I would be much happier if one relied on the other provisions in subsection (4), namely that there is no permanent endowment and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
that the income is more than £1,000 a year. By all means they should be registered; I do not dissent from that. But this proviso which means that if a charity is in occupation of any land it has to be registered, even if the income is less than £1,000 a year, no longer makes sense. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee decided to finish at six o'clock, but is it your Lordships' wish to continue with the amendment and get it out of the way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Noble Lords</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the main purpose of the noble Lord's amendment, but it would be regrettable and misleading if we were now to leave out the words "the use and occupation of any land". They were in the 1960 Act. Section 4(4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following charities are not required to be registered…(c) any charity having neither any permanent endowment, nor any income from property amounting to more than fifteen pounds a year"—</p></blockquote>
I agree that has become ridiculous—
	<br><blockquote><p>"nor the use and occupation of any land".</p></blockquote>
As the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has proposed that it should be amended, we would have the omission of a charity that had no use occupation of any land omitted. I think that would be wrong. I believe that we should make it quite clear that if the charity has no use or occupation of any land then there should not be a requirement to be registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say about this. My instinct is to say that the amendment should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, could be detrimental to a number of charities. At present charities have relief from rates. If they were not registered they would experience difficulty in getting that relief, either from the uniform business rate or if by some mischance in the future some other form of rating on land were to be brought back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend Lord Renton said that his instinct was that this amendment should not be accepted. I wish he had said that of the last amendment as well. I agree with him. His instinct is right, and for the reasons my noble friend Lord Swinfen used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are specific purposes for including charities which use or occupy land in the category of charities which are required to register. Charities are given statutory relief on property which they use for charitable purposes of a minimum of 80 per cent. of the non-domestic rate. The local authority has discretion to increase that relief to a full 100 per cent. Therefore, the charity may pay no non-domestic rates at all.

Charities which do not use or occupy land are not affected. However, a charity which does occupy land will find it a distinct advantage to be registered because it can easily prove to the local authority that it is a charity and therefore that it is entitled to rate

relief. A charity which occupies property, but is not registered, often has great difficulty in convincing the local authority that it is entitled to this relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes a charity may have an income of £1,000 or less but nevertheless own quite a large amount of property. It may, for example, hold the freeholds of properties let on long leases or a piece of agricultural land which suddenly acquires development potential and rises many times in value. We believe that it would be imprudent to allow that kind of charity to escape public accountability and the supervision of the commissioners.

I do not see that any particular difficulties will be caused to charities having the use or the occupation of land being required to register. The duties consequent on registration are not onerous and we have indeed taken considerable care to try to keep the load as light as possible for small charities. As there are positive advantages to charities by being registered I hope that Members of the Committee will consider it desirable to keep the provisions already set down in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few final words. Use or occupation could imply casual use or occupation. It does not necessarily imply regular use and occupation. It certainly does not need to imply any form of legal instrument as a result of which there is use and occupation. It is the sweeping nature of the phrase that concerns me. It could, for example, include the village cricket team, if that happened to be a charitable trust, which does not own any land but which plays every week on the local pitch. In so doing it would be "using" land. The team would be a charity within the terms of this subsection that had the use or occupation of some land. Is it seriously suggested that the team ought to be registered on that ground? Perhaps it should be registered on other grounds, but I would suggest not on that ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But has the noble Lord any evidence that the expression "use or occupation of land" has given rise to any difficulty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say that the amendment is not something that I dreamed up in my own head. It emerged as a result of representations which were made to me by some charitable organisations that this could cause difficulty and might do so and that the legislation would be better without it. I cannot put it any higher or lower than that.

I do not detect any great groundswell of support for the amendment in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can help the noble Lord. He said that representations had been made to him about this. The provision has been in the 1960 Act for the past 31 years and we have had no representations made to us that this has been an inconvenience: in fact rather the reverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps those making the representations thought they would get further making them to me than to the noble Earl. However, the fact of the matter is that it was felt that, if the amendment were accepted, the situation in respect of small

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
charities would be improved and one danger - namely, that casual use and occupation of any land might mean that a charity had to be registered although its income was less than £1,000 a year - would be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I said, I do not detect a great deal of support for the amendment and I ask the Committee's leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
