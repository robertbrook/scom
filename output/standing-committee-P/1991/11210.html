	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>CHARITIES BILL [H.L.]</h1></div>
	<time>Tuesday, 10th December, 1991</time>
	<p>	<b>The Committee met at ten o'clock.</b></p>
	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>
	<p>Clause 27 [	<i>Annual returns by registered charities</i>]:</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendment No. 47 not moved.</i>]</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendment No. 48 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 48A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 24, line 8, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("() Nothing in this section shall apply to a charity the gross income of which in its last financial year did not exceed £25,000.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>() The Secretary of State may by order amend the above subsection by substituting a different sum for the sum being specified there.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Viscount said: We discussed earlier the principle of the level at which a charity with a small amount of income may be involved in the various provisions of the Bill in relation to accounts and annual reports. Members of the Committee were not entirely in favour of the principle. The purpose of moving this amendment is to inquire of my noble friend the Government's view about exempting charities on a low level of income. There is no reference to a level of income in this clause in relation to the necessity of making annual returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that any registered charity with whatever level of income at its disposal, large or small, will have to make annual returns. I question whether the necessary expense involved in having to make those returns should be borne by a very small charity with a low level of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level which I have suggested in the amendment is open to question. It may be too high. I have an open mind about it. However, I should like to know my noble friend's view about the principle that charities with a very low level of income should be required to make annual returns. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments tabled my noble friend Lord Mountgarret and the noble Lord, Lord Ennals, would take the exception from the accounts provision of the Bill one stage further for charities with an income of £25,000 or less. That would remove from such charities the requirement to prepare and submit to the commissioners an annual report and return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little additional burden on trustees of registered charities if they are asked to write a short report on their activities and to make an annual return of information about their charity. That would include matters of names and addresses of trustees and so on and a requirement to send the documents with the accounts to the commissioners. The commissioners are given power to dispense with the requirement for an annual return in the case of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
particular charity or class of charity if they should think fit. Doubtless that power could be exercised to relieve the burdens on certain small charities if that seems sensible at some future date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given a lot of thought to the financial levels set in the Bill because of the variety of charities and the level of their activities and sources of income. We think we have that about right. We have provided for the Secretary of State to be able to alter the figure of £10,000 by order if that proves sensible in the light of experience. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend will agree that that is a reasonable level at which to set the requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend referred to a level of £10,000 and I did not quite catch what he said, and I apologise for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have provided for the Secretary of State to be able to alter the figure of £10,000 by order if it proves sensible in the light of experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend but in this clause there is no figure to alter. In order to be consistent, perhaps the Government will consider inserting a figure of £10,000. That would be consistent with the level in Clause 21. Is my noble friend prepared to consider that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that charities which have an income of less than £10,000 can produce the simplified form of accounts. Charities with an income of over £100,000 must produce audited accounts. Therefore, there are two levels. I believe it would be unnecessary to have an additional level of £25,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend. I am glad to know that the commissioners will have power to dispense with such a requirement. The matter has been discussed. I believe that there is a degree of sympathy for the principle but I can understand that it may be undesirable for that matter to be written into the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 27 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked at the Notes on Clauses which the Government have been kind enough to let us have. Clause 27 introduces a new requirement on trustees of registered charities to make an annual return in a prescribed form. I am not at all clear what the annual return is meant to cover. Under Clause 24 there is an obligation to prepare an annual report. There are other provisions in relation to preparing a financial statement of affairs or producing audited accounts. Then in Clause 27 comes the requirement to make an annual return. How does that differ from the annual report or the statement of affairs? Does it mean that in effect the trustees have to produce three documents each year to the Charity Commissioners? If so, I should be interested to know from the Government what the annual return is meant to contain. The Notes on Clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will be used by the commissioners to ensure that information held on the register about each charity is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
up-to-date and to gather information for the purpose of monitoring charities for signs of maladministration and fraud".</p></blockquote>
I am a little unclear whether this is yet another document that trustees of charities have to produce or whether it is merely a combination of the other two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The annual return will provide the commissioners with information which will be essential for their monitoring and supervisory function. It will also maintain the register as a public source of accurate and comprehensive information about charities. For those reasons it is important that there is an effective sanction for non-compliance with the requirements of the clause. It will give up-to-date details of the register and what the trust is doing. It will have information required by the commissioners for their monitoring purposes. It will be made clear by the commissioners exactly what information will be required of trustees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for going on about this point but I think my noble friend was asking whether the return is the report or something different from the report. It would be helpful if we could be told that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the difficulty. The report need be only quite a short account of what the trust has done during the course of the year. The return will contain matters such as the names and addresses of trustees, the number of the bank account and other more formal details of what the trust is. The report is really what the trust does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thus three things will be required—a report, a return and a statement of accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the noble Earl.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the point of having a report and a return?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They need not be in two separate glossy documents. In the case of a small charity they could almost be on the same piece of paper. One would give the details of the trust, what it does and the number of its bank account and then one could put at the bottom a résumé of what has happened over the past year. As the trust grows in size the requirements will be greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 27 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 28 [	<i>Offences</i>]:</p>
	<p>10.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 49:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 24, line 9, after ("who") insert (" knowingly").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a fairly simple amendment which I hope the Government will be able to accept. Clause 28 is the penalty clause in relation not only to what we have just discussed—the requirement to prepare an annual return—but also to the requirement to prepare and transmit the annual report and, in relation to the requirement,
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide any person who so requests in writing with a copy of the charity's most recent accounts".</p></blockquote>
Persistently to be in default in relation to those obligations is made a criminal offence by Clause 28. That would seem a little hard unless the trustee who was to be prosecuted actually knew that there had been this default. In those circumstances it seems to me that the word "knowingly" inserted in the appropriate place would clear up that matter and make it absolutely clear that only the trustee who has been personally in default will be caught by this subsection. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand what the noble Lord is aiming at with this amendment. The proposed offence is already very carefully worded so that trustees who are merely careless or forgetful cannot commit the offence. It requires that the default, whether it be failure to submit the annual return or failure in connection with the provision of accounts, should have been persistently committed. A trustee who fails once to fulfil one of those requirements will not be committing an offence. It also requires that the default must have arisen "without reasonable excuse". The trustee who has a reasonable excuse for being in default will again not be committing an offence. He will be committing an offence only if he is both persistent in his failure and has no reasonable excuse for his persistent failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see what the amendment would add because in order to have persistently defaulted a trustee would have to have ignored reminders without a reasonable excuse. If he had ignored reminders and had no reasonable excuse I cannot see how he would be in the position in which the noble Lord, Lord Richard, would wish him to be of not "knowingly" being in default. The point is that if these reports have not been submitted the person will have 10 months in which to submit them. If they have not been submitted it is likely that around six weeks after that there will be a reminder from the commissioners. If there is still no report there will be a number of reminders. It is only at the very end when after all those reminders the trustees still have not fulfilled their obligations that action can be taken. Therefore I do not think that the word "knowingly" would have any relevance, though I understand why the noble Lord has moved the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may try to set the noble Lord's mind at rest. I do not think that he need worry about lack of 	<i>mens rea.</i> On the wording of the clause as it stands, the court would require 	<i>mens rea</i> to be proved. The word "knowingly" pretty well overlaps with the word "persistently". In any event, if it is a question of the word "knowingly" implying knowledge of the law, we all know that lack of knowledge of the law is no defence anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an example of where the lawyers get to when they want to lay on guilt with a trowel. This person must be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly, without reasonable excuse… persistently in default".</p></blockquote>
If he is all those things, he is sure to be guilty. I remind the Committee that the great mischief of the term
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
"without reasonable excuse" is to be found in the law of value added tax. We have special tribunals which sit all day, every day, every week to consider pleas of reasonable excuse. If one reads those cases one is astonished at the length to which administration can go where there is no apparent discretionary flexibility about imposing penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One case last week involved a small child of two or three years of age. He got at his father's papers and pushed them all down the lavatory. The Customs and Excise held that this man did not have a reasonable excuse and that he ought to have taken more precautions to see to it that the child did not do any such thing. The father went to the tribunal, bless your life, which decided that it was not a reasonable excuse that that happened. So surely he will keep the lavatory door locked in future. This is another example of where we get to when we are trying to provide for degrees of delinquency. The term "without reasonable excuse", if it is to be repeated and repeated, will require another layer of the judicial system to decide questions in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person is knowingly and persistently in default without reasonable excuse he knows he is in default. It is a question of whether he has a reasonable excuse. In this case he must be in default not only once but several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the lawyers to consider what they are doing to the poor citizen who has got into a mess with his affairs. They try to catch him on every side. We ought to reduce the length of the formula which will either send a defaulting person to prison or subject him to other penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may put one matter to the noble Earl. I am a trustee of a charity, as I am sure are other Members of the Committee. Some of the trustees do not attend annual general meetings. One or two have not attended any annual general meetings but make their services available for the purposes of consultation with the officers of the charity. What is the position of one of those trustees if returns have not been submitted? I think that I, as someone who is not a lawyer, understand what the consequences would be if the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, was accepted and the word "knowingly" was added. The charity concerned finds it very useful to have such trustees who do not attend annual general meetings and who would therefore be quite unaware that the charity had not fulfilled its statutory responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say one final word. In Clause 24(1) the obligation to prepare the annual report is placed upon the charity trustees of the charity—namely, all the trustees of the charity. In relation to Clause 26, on lines 25, 26 and 27 of page 23, the obligation is again placed upon those trustees to comply with the request. Therefore, in the statute the obligation is perfectly clear, it is on the trustees as a whole, whether or not each individual trustee knows about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Houghton of Sowerby thinks that I am imposing obligations upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
the citizenry. I was trying to lift them, not to make them worse, and to confine the offence to the person who knows about it rather than to make it an offence which can be laid against any of the trustees whether or not they have knowledge of the offence and whether or not they have received reminders from the Charity Commission. That is the point and, with respect, I do not see any reason why the word should not be included to make it perfectly clear that the person who will be caught by Clause 28 will be the person who knows about the offence and not other trustees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, who does not want additional words inserted into the Bill. I do not think that when the noble Lord, Lord Richard, put down a modest amendment to include the word "knowingly" he thought that that would involve a description of a young lad who put a whole lot of papers down a lavatory. That was quite interesting but I do not see that it had any relevance to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is this. One cannot possibly not know something if one has received persistent reminders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, asked about the position with regard to trustees who have not attended the annual general meeting. All trustees by their nature as trustees have responsibilities. If they decide not to attend meetings and things go wrong that does not relieve them of their responsibilities. They still hold those responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scenario would be that the secretary of the trust would have to file the report and accounts within 10 months of the end of the year. As I explained, if he does not do that within six weeks the commissioners will remind him to do so. That continues, with several reminders being sent. If the secretary has taken no notice of those reminders and has failed to forward the accounts, the trustees corporately are to blame. Each trustee is equally blameworthy. If that is because they have the wrong secretary that is their fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the scenario as set out in the Bill I do not see that any persons or any trust could not know that they were in default of their obligations when they were in a position to be reminded of them persistently by the Charity Commission. Whether the trustees individually know that is a matter between the trustees and the person to whom they give executive responsibility, but it is a responsibility of the trustees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to keep the debate going for too long, but I should like to say that Clause 28 relates to an offence laid against "any person". That could be a charity trustee, whether or not he knows about the offence. The noble Earl appeared to adumbrate a doctrine of vicarious criminal responsibility which I found difficult to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for returning to the matter, but the noble Earl's statement worried me considerably. I wonder how much it is appreciated how difficult matters will be for charities once the Bill is on the statute book. The charity to which I referred is one for which a significant number of publicly spirited people are prepared to come together and give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
their time to be of assistance in the running of the charity. I suspect that that is reproduced in thousands of cases. The suggestion that the failure of a trustee to attend a meeting puts him at risk under the criminal law is a very extreme proposition. I hope that the noble Earl will reflect upon that with his advisers before the next stage of the Bill. If the trustees become aware of the risk that they run in the future once the Bill is on the statute book there could well be difficulty in persuading people to agree to become trustees. One of the responsibilities of the NCVO and others and of the Charity Commissioners will be to warn people that failure to attend annual general meetings of the trustees could conceivably put them at risk under the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find what has been said this morning disturbing. I hope that the noble Earl will reflect upon the matter between now and the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was being persuaded by the noble Earl's arguments and beginning to think this a minor manner until he produced the example of a secretary who could have been negligent and could by that negligence make trustees, who could be a long way away, especially in a large trust, criminally liable in that vicarious way. It would certainly have the effect which the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, adumbrates of frightening off trustees. That is surely the last thing the Bill intends. Will the noble Earl not take the matter away and think about it again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to what has been said I find the amendment unnecessary. Again we look at the position of small charities and the trustees of small charities. They are the people the noble Lord, Lord Harris, had in mind. For the large charities it must be a prerequisite that the filing of reports and accounts and returns must be done and be seen to be done. I do not believe that in large charities, which have highly paid people to carry out the functions of secretary or clerk, would be in that position if they were sufficiently competent to pay attention to what is quite rightly required under the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of small charities I do not accept that people will be put off. Those are not difficult matters to attend to. They may be irritating, as I have made clear, and in some cases expensive. Nonetheless, if they are to be written into the Bill I cannot see that it will deter trustees from attending to their duties as they are required to do. If they continue to ignore reminders from the Charity Commissioners, for example, frankly they are being a nuisance and they are just adding to the cost of running that organisation. That benefits no one. There is no need, I believe, to get too concerned about this clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say I have never heard of a criminal offence which seems to constitute that of employing an incompetent secretary. However that is the effect of this part of the Bill. If the secretary does not do his job, the charity's trustees will be liable, whether or not they are aware of his negligence. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
cannot be right. I shall carefully consider what the noble Earl has said this morning. However, at first blush, I found his comments disturbing. I do not propose to divide the Committee on this matter now but I may well wish to return to it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may add a few further comments. I realise that some Members of the Committee are disturbed by the measure. As to whether the word "knowingly" in the amendment should be included in the Bill, that is one matter. I believe most Members of the Committee would agree that the word "knowingly" adds nothing to the protection of the trustees. However, I believe that the point that has fussed some Members of the Committee, especially the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, is the fact that the provisions of this part of the Bill might frighten off trustees. The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, said he was swayed by my comments until I said that the secretary would be criminally liable in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trust is run properly, no trustee has anything to worry about. It does not matter that a trustee does not appear at meetings. That will not frighten off the people that the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, has suggested may be frightened off. It is only when a trust is run badly that the provision applies. If a trust is run badly that may be the fault of the person who was charged with running the trust; in other words, the secretary. However the responsibility for the trust must rest with the trustees. They have delegated their responsibilities to a secretary but the responsibility in the end rests with the trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe it would be right to remove that responsibility from the trustees. If it were to be removed, what would be the position? There would be a person purporting to work on behalf of the trust but working in such a way that the law was being contravened. The whole point of this Bill is to ensure that trusts and charitable trusts are run effectively within the law. If they are contravening the law, someone must be responsible for that. At the end of the day it is the trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now return to the point I started with. There is not much chance of anyone not knowing that he is not complying with the law as that person will be persistently reminded of his obligations. I hope the Committee will consider that an onerous responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will individual trustees be reminded if there has been a failure given the fact that the Charity Commission already—as the noble Earl has pointed out—has their names and addresses? Presumably, if a return has been submitted in the past the names and addresses will have been supplied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with this issue is that the noble Earl seems to be suggesting that the responsibility of a trustee is similar to that of a director of a company. I find that a difficult concept. Of course, in the case of most small, medium sized and, in the overwhelming number of cases, large charities, those returns will be made available. However what I am worried about—I do not wish to be wearisomely repetitive—is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
if trustees do not attend annual general meetings they are putting themselves at risk if there has been a failure to make the appropriate returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will now be an obligation on those concerned to warn trustees that they are at risk of criminal penalties if there has been a failure. In my view some people will undoubtedly be far more cautious about agreeing to lend their names as trustees of charities if they recognise the risk to which they may be exposing themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Harris, has asked me a specific question. He asked whether each trustee will be notified. The answer is that the commissioners have a correspondent whom they get in touch with. In sthe case we are discussing the correspondent would be the secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an obligation for the commissioners to write to every single trustee. They would have the obligation to write to the secretary and serve a reminder on him. If the trustees are so out of touch with what is going on that they are not aware of what the secretary is doing and the secretary has not informed them that he has received three, four or five reminders, the trustees are at fault for having a secretary who is contravening the law in the way he is running the trust. I find it hard to believe that not a single trustee of a charity will be aware of communications that a secretary has received from the commissioners. In the end that is the responsibility of the trustees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to continue flogging a dead horse—I hope the noble Earl will forgive that somewhat inapt personal metaphor. The fact of the matter is, however, that the criminal offence here is that of the trustees having employed an incompetent secretary and not having kept sufficient watch over him. That is not the criminal offence as set out in Clause 28. Indeed, if the Charity Commissioners are in touch with the correspondent of a particular charity, and the correspondent does not inform the charity trustees of that, those trustees can be guilty of a criminal offence, according to the noble Earl's theory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the case even though the trustees are totally ignorant of what has been going on. One may make it a criminal offence for a charity trustee to act in total ignorance. However, to make him responsible for being persistently in default in those circumstances is wrong. As I have said, we may have to return to this issue at an appropriate stage of this Bill. However, at this stage I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 28 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 29 [	<i>Power of Commissioners to bring proceedings with respect to charities</i>]:</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendment No. 49A not moved.</i>]</p>
	<p>Clause 29 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 30 [	<i>Divestment of charity property held by official custodian for charities</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 49B:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 25, leave out lines 18 to 33.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
The noble Lord said: I move this amendment on behalf of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. I seek to leave out lines 18 to 33 on page 25. Those words are not only unnecessary but also it may be self-defeating to include them in the Bill. The first four lines of Clause 30(4) give a power to the Commissioners to make various provisions with regard to property held by the official custodian. The subsection states further provisions in relation to that property. There is a mass of detail in the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must remind the Committee that when statutes come to be interpreted, the courts take the view that if some matters are expressed there is a presumption that other matters are not intended to be included. I have avoided the Latin tag to spare the Committee. It really would be most unfortunate if the Commissioners found there were matters which are not included in this mass of detail in lines 18 to 33 which they wish to mention but which the courts might not recognise if they mentioned it. Therefore we should try to avoid unnecessary detail in our statutes anyway as they are cluttered up no end. Here is an opportunity to avoid some of that clutter. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to express agreement with my noble friend Lord Renton. It seems odd to state that the powers exercisable by the commissioners by virtue of this clause shall be exercisable by them of their own motion. However, the clause then states that that will not be the case and that the commissioners will require the consent and agreement of the Attorney-General. It does seem to me very odd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have myself looked at this clause and to say that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The powers exercisable by the Commissioners by virtue of this section shall be exercisable by them of their own motion",</p></blockquote>
and then go on to say that they will not be but that the motion will require the consent and agreement of the Attorney General, seems to me to be very odd. For the life of me I cannot understand it. The commissioners are a trustworthy body. I cannot understand why they require to come to an agreement with the Attorney-General. I do not understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3O will allow the official custodian for charities to divest himself of property which is held on behalf of charities in accordance with the directions given by the commissioners. Then subsection (4) of the clause sets out the matters which may be included in the directions to the official custodian for the purposes of his divestment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Renton - as I thought he probably might - understandably said that if something is put in a Bill it insinuates that other things which are not in the Bill ought or are expressly excluded. That I accept is always one of the dangers of putting anything in a Bill. But we thought that it was desirable to put these matters in because it indicates the types of directions which the commissioners may make. They can provide for the divestment to be carried out in stages or for transfers of property to take place at different times. It can require the official custodian to transfer any specified investment or classes or descriptions of investment either to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
charity owning the investment or to another person who is nominated by the charity and authorised to hold its property; and it can require the official custodian to sell a specified investment or class or description of investments and pay the sales proceeds either direct to the charity which owns the investment or into a bank account in that charity's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list of the directions that may be made by the commissioners under this clause is specifically not exhaustive. Others can be included too. The noble and learned Lord might have considered, when he tabled this amendment, that it is unnecessary to amplify the general power to give directions by the inclusion of those sorts of specific examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is important to put it beyond doubt that the commissioners may authorise the official custodian in this way to take steps which will be essential to the orderly and efficient divestment of charity property which is held by him. The divestment of the official custodian will be quite an undertaking. I think it is reasonable to specify in divesting himself of these holdings exactly the types of things to which he ought to address his mind and which directions the charity commissioners may give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1O.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I may put down a marker similar to that made by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, although in fact we have passed Clause 29 and we are now discussing Clause 30. I should like to underline what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton. I find Clause 29(5) very difficult to understand. I ask the Minister to note that and I shall come back to this matter at some subsequent stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened very carefully to my noble friend Lord Ferrers, but I must confess that he did not seem to me to make out a case for anticipating the exercise of the commissioners' discretion by going selectively into details of this kind. There are a vast number of matters that of course they will wish to consider. But for the draftsman or whoever has instructed him to go selectively into the particular matters mentioned here seems to me to be quite unnecessary and could be misleading. Indeed, as I said, if it ever came to court it could be counter-productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that between now and Report stage my noble friend will keep an open mind on this matter. I have no doubt that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, will come back to it. Meanwhile, unless any other Member of the Committee has anything to add, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 49C:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 26, line 19, leave out ("the appropriate part of that amount") and insert ("such part of such amount as they may specify").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment goes with Amendment No. 49D. They are simply drafting amendments. This amendment is an attempt on the part of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, to move out words which quite frankly in the context are quite unnecessary. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realised when I saw this amendment that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, was trying to improve the drafting. With respect to the noble and learned Lord, I am not sure whether it does. He is trying to ensure that the effect is the same; it is merely the wording which is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord suggests that we leave out in line 19 of Clause 26:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The appropriate part of that amount".</p></blockquote>
We say that the commissioners may direct the official custodian to pay the appropriate part of that amount to each of two or more other charities so specified, and for this purpose the appropriate part means:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such part of such amount as they may specify".</p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord's wording would say to pay,
	<br><blockquote><p>"such part of such amount as they may specify".</p></blockquote>
With respect to him, I do not think that that is quite as clear. It involves a more complicated wording. If the wording in the Bill is kept, it is perfectly clear that the official custodian may dispose of the money in whatever way he or the commissioners may feel correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, if there are three charities which might become the beneficiaries of the funds of an account, he may decide to pay them in equal parts or in relation to the size of each individual charity. If that is so, the words in the Bill make it perfectly clear that the appropriate part of that amount may be that which the charity commissioners so decide. I hope that the noble Lord agrees that the words in the Bill are clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words of the Bill are indeed clear. The words in the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, are equally clear but they have the great advantage that we lose two lines out of the Bill. It seems to me that that is a thoroughly desirable state of affairs. If all our amendments were so successful, we should be much happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it has occurred to my noble friend Lord Ferrers that the words in the last two lines, lines 21 and 22, are merely repetitive of the effect of paragraph (a) of subsection (8). It is quite unnecessary. However, I have done my best. I expect that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, will come back to the matter. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendment No. 49D not moved.</i>]</p>
	<p>Clause 30 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clauses 31 and 32 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 33 [	<i>Restrictions on dispositions of charity land</i>]:</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendments Nos. 50 and 50A had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Allenby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 50AA:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 30, leave out lines 1 and 2.</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a proposal to leave out paragraph (d) from Clause 33(3). The proposal in the Bill to widen the powers of authorities to deal with land and buildings is to be generally welcomed and it is right that there should be adequate safeguards over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
the exercise of that power. But the proposals as set out in the Bill apply to such a huge range of transactions for which previously no consent was required under the 1960 Act that it raises pretty horrific administrative problems for quite a large number of charities. The same problem is addressed by my Amendment No. 50BA. In a particular context it is being raised by the next amendment on the Marshalled List in the name of the right reverend Prelate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unusual for the trustees of some charities, as we have heard in our earlier discussions, to meet perhaps once or twice a year. It is a fairly common practice for charities to delegate the approval of land transactions to a property sub-committee which may have quite frequent transactions, some of them really quite urgent. I cannot see how it would be possible to comply with the provision on the full meeting of the charity trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible to give a great many examples. However, I shall content myself with one particular charity. It has a number of commercial leases—about 100. It has to deal with renewals, licences and so forth, at least a dozen times a year. In addition, it has a number of tenancy agreements. The wording of both Clauses 33 and 34, referring as they do to other dispositions and other instruments, seem to me wide enough to apply the rules to tenants' agreements. In this case the provisions will apply to all agreements to both houses and flats on Rent Act or market terms. The charity has about 200 of those. New agreements are an almost weekly occurrence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safeguards in paragraphs (a), (b), and in particular (c), are pretty strong. I submit that (d), with the terrific administrative problems that it involves, is not necessary. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may briefly support the noble Lord. I too believe that the requirements in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are fairly heavy. I am certain that any professional adviser would tend to be very careful before he gave the trustees his agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To add to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) the burden of paragraph (d) might well make it unduly difficult for the trustees of a charity to dispose of a property which they did not require. It also might involve it in a great waste of time and unnecessary expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the disposition of land which is held by a trustee and in trust for charitable purposes. In other words, where that land might have been given to a trust many years ago, it now will be sold, or disposed of or leased, or whatever. In Clause 33(3), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) provide a set of hoops through which the trustees ought to go; and that if they go through those hoops it is not necessary to go to the commissioners for their approval. Those are hoops which any prudent trustee would go through himself before disposing of land or property which he has in trust to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anxiety of the noble Lord, Lord Allen, is that paragraph (d) is too hard because it puts a requirement on the trustees themselves to approve the terms of any such disposition. Charity trustees are responsible for the proper administration and
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
management of their charity. I believe it is right that they should have a duty to protect their property. Therefore, if they propose to sell or otherwise dispose of the charity's property it ought to meet and have the approval of the charity's trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite possible for the trustees to delegate the carrying out of the tasks which are specified in Clause 3(3) (a) and (b); in other words, obtaining a written report from a surveyor acting exclusively for the charity and advertising the proposed sale in a manner recommended by the charity's surveyor. All that can be delegated to their officers or to their employees, or even to a sub-committee of the trustees themselves. But we believe it right that the charity trustees should take the final decision as to whether the terms which have been negotiated for the sale or for the disposition of the property in any other way are the best that can be reasonably obtained; and that they should do this following a a full discussion of all the relevant factors at a properly constituted meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the requirements for a properly constituted meeting may present some difficulties for those charities which have large numbers of trustees who may meet relatively infrequently, but who have to deal with a large number of land transactions. I am quite happy to look at that again in the light of what has been said at this meeting. I believe that the basic principle that the trustees ought to be themselves responsible if they dispose of that land which is in their trust is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the noble Earl will clarify what it is he said he will look at again. As I understand it, he says that if one has these weekly occurrences one has to have weekly duly constituted meetings of the charity trustees. Whether we shall end up at the end of the Bill by having any trustees at all, I do not know. However, leaving that aside, I believe that that is what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Earl then referred to looking again at something. I am not clear what that was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make my point clear. First, it is our view that where land or property is disposed of, although one can go through and delegate the methods by which that is achieved to officials, it is the trustees' responsibility in the end. Therefore, we feel that it ought to be the responsibility of the trustees and should have their sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went on to say that I recognise that in some cases there are very large bodies of trustees, all of whom have to collect together to operate corporately. I understand that that presents some problems. It is that which I said I would try to look at again. However, the principle that it ought to be the trustees who dispose of the land is, I believe, a correct one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the noble Earl for what he said. I was worried not only about the large number of meetings which would have to be held in particular cases where many have to be held, but about the geographical spread. There is a great deal of difference between duly constituted meetings of the charity trustees in the Aldwych or in Aberystwyth or in Aberdeen. In certain cases, getting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
the trustees together in the same geographical spot is liable to be both difficult and expensive. I do not know whether the noble Earl has tried to travel from London to Aberystwyth by train in the coldest seasons of the year. It can be not only difficult and very often unpleasant but sometimes impossible. That would create difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the noble Earl for what he said. Perhaps it may be possible to include a phrase such as "or in writing". May that not be helpful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider that. The last thing we wish to do is to impose burdens upon trustees. It is possible that the statutes may allow a quorum of trustees. We do not intend to say that every trustee on every occasion should be present. If the statutes provide for a quorum, that will suffice. I realise that there may be difficulties and if Members of the Committee feel that this will impose intolerable difficulties I shall look again at the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the noble Earl comment on why safeguards are necessary for land which is being leased? Although I do not necessarily agree with all the provisions, I understand the reason for the strong safeguards as regards land which is being finally disposed of. That is important. However, that is different from leasing and I wonder why leasing is caught in all those stringent safeguards. Later we shall deal with fairly short leases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the situation raised by the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, is one in which the trustees hold a long lease of perhaps a freehold site with a building on it. A 99 year lease on some land can be extremely valuable. The trustees would need to take just as much care when disposing of property of that sort as disposing of freehold property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, leaseholds have a value of their own. As the Minister said, proper advice should be taken from a surveyor to ensure that the land is disposed of properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the noble Earl will tell me whether in the case mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, where there are some 200 disposals per year, the matter could be delegated by the trustees to a sub-committee of the trustees which might consist of co-opted individuals who happen to be the officers of the charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards leasing, does this clause deal with the disposition of land already held on leasehold or does it deal with the leasing of land which is already owned? If it is the former, then I understand the Minister's remarks. But I am not entirely clear about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend Lord Swinfen is right. I could understand, as the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, could understand, why the sanctions were necessary for the disposal of land, and the noble Lord asked why they were necessary for the leasing of land. As my noble friend says, when land or property is leased it can be an extremely valuable commodity. The use of that commodity is being
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
forgone by the trustees for a number of years. Therefore, we believe that leasing should also be covered by the criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing new in this. Section 29 of the 1960 Act applied to leases as well as sales. Therefore, this is a repetition of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am in any way satisfied by that answer. It remains a great practical problem. Nothing in the Bill authorises the trustees to delegate the powers to a property committee. The Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"approve those terms at a duly constituted meeting of the charity trustees".</p></blockquote>
The Bill proposes, and the noble Earl seems to defend, that in the case I mentioned, which is by no means unusual, there must be a duly constituted meeting of the charity trustees once a week. That is so absurd that I must press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill says that there should be a duly constituted meeting, but the meeting does not have to consist of every single charity trustee. At your Lordships' Committees every noble Lord does not attend. I shall look again at the matter if that meets with the Committee's approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the position, the noble Earl will look again at the practicalities of the position. As regards the principle that the trustees should put the final chop on the disposition of land, the noble Earl is firm. However, as regards what sort of meeting, how often and whether it can be delegated to a property sub-committee or done in writing, the Government are flexible. If that is the case, perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Allen, will not press the matter at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord is extremely tolerant. It seems to me that the requirement is already met by paragraph (c), which places a requirement on the trustees to be satisfied having considered the surveyor's report that the terms of the proposed agreement are the best that can be reasonably obtained for the charity. In view of what has been said I am still not satisfied. However, I shall consider what has been said and I may return to this matter on Report.

that the terms of the proposed agreement are the best that can reasonably be obtained for the charity.").</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The right reverend Prelate said: In moving Amendment No. 50B in the name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 51AA and 51BA which provide definitions for the terms used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak about short leases and the impact which Clause 33 will have on them. The amendments are intended to deal with particularly short leases and to provide in the interests of the charity concerned for some flexibility in the conditions for disposing with the Charity Commissioners' consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 50B applies only to leases of not more than 15 years without a premium. It sets out to achieve that, provided the trustees have taken all reasonable steps to obtain the best terms for the charity, they will not be obliged in all cases to spend money in obtaining a formal written report from a survey or, or advertising, or obtaining specific advice from the surveyor that advertising will serve no useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is limited in scope to land held by a fairly restricted class of bodies within the Church of England; namely, diocesan boards of finance, diocesan trustee bodies, parochial church councils and incumbents and church wardens. In all those cases, except where a parochial church council or an incumbent and church wardens hold land on a very short-term lease, any lease of the land will either need to by granted by or will need the consent of a diocesan body; so there is a safeguard there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may describe the types of property which the amendment covers. They are various and it is precisely for that reason that we look for some flexibility. It may be appropriate to get a formal written report from a surveyor but in other cases that would not serve any useful purpose. The property could be a major asset such as a church hall. It could be a curate's house or a parsonage. It could be an odd piece of land next to the church hall which no one previously thought was useful to have. Suddenly a parishioner comes along with a use of his own for that corner of land and asks for a tenancy. The curate's house may be empty for a certain foreseeable time. It would, for one reason or another, be useful to a person living in the village to be allowed to live there, but on a very short-term lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases where there is no market because only one person is interested in taking the lease and where the cost of a formal written report by the surveyor would be out of all proportion to the sums involved—it might well eat up much of the unexpected windfall for the church—the trustees may decide that all they need is one or two telephone conversations with a surveyor—indeed, some dioceses in the Church of England have their own surveyors—and that advertising is a total waste of money. It is obviously essential that trustees take whatever steps are reasonable to get the best terms, but they should not be required to go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This applies only to a limited class of Church of England bodies where there are normally special safeguards—diocesan boards of finance, diocesan
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
trustee bodies and so on. In the diocese of Worcester all these parcels of land are vested in trustees. If it is reasonable to get the best terms and the reasonable things have been done we should not go beyond those requirements. If the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, felt able to say that he wished to look at the possibility of a similar amendment covering charities generally I would not object to that. If I were to get that assurance I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for moving this amendment which was tabled in the name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury. I can appreciate that the diocesan authorities and the parochial church councils and those who hold office in the Church are responsible bodies and officers who, it can be agreed, would act responsibly in their stewardship of charity property where they act as trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued in the case of leases of 15 years or less that it should be for them to take, or assist on, whatever steps they feel are appropriate in order to ensure that the terms of the lease are the best that can reasonably be obtained for the charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on the previous amendment we discussed whether and to what extent the provision of subsection (3) of Clause 33 should apply to all transactions of charities' land. I am prepared to consider whether we could not disapply the requirements of subsection (3) in respect of leases of five years or less. If we were able to do that, it would at least go part of the way to addressing the right reverend Prelate's concern. I hope that he will feel able to meet me half way on that and will feel that we are meeting the major part of his concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of letting property can be both complex and extensive and they may commit the future use of the property for the charity for many years to come. It is right and proper that all trustees contemplating a significant lease—after all, a lease for 15 years is clearly a significant lease—should take professional advice. I do not see any reason why ecclesiastical bodies and officers should be excluded from this duty but I shall certainly see whether it is possible to make that exclusion for those leases of fewer than five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that suggestion. In some villages a small, not unduly prepossessing hall requires more than five years to pay it off. I wonder whether that affects the issue and whether we could go to seven years.

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 50BA:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 30, line 17, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("() Subsection (1) above shall also not, subject to paragraph (a) of subsection (2), apply to the granting of a lease or licence for a term ending not more than 22 years after it is granted not being a lease or licence granted wholly or partly in consideration of a fine so long as before the granting of any such lease or licence the charity trustees shall have obtained and considered such professional or other advice as shall in all the circumstances have seemed to them to be appropriate.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I was interested to hear the noble Earl lifting the curtain, as it were, on the reply which I imagine will be forthcoming to this amendment. It has not been an easy amendment to prepare. This is my second attempt and the noble Viscount, Lord St. Davids, also had a shot at it. However, it is one of considerable importance again from the point of view of the practical day-to-day operation of charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as drafted included all leases of whatever length of term and probably some licences. I remind the Committee that at present, under Section 29 of the Charities Act 1960, an order from the Charity Commissioners is required only for a lease of 22 years and over. The amendment follows that limitation. Twenty-two years is not a figure plucked from the air, as the periods we have just been discussing seem to have been. This amendment would mean that, in the case of these short leases, charities would not need to comply with all the requirements of subsection (3); namely, the need to obtain a surveyor's report, to advertise and to obtain the best terms reasonably obtainable. It does, however, suggest - and this was not in the 1960 Act—that they would have to obtain what I might term a lower standard of advice. That is not a new invention. It is based on the concept of obtaining and considering proper advice contained in Clause 35(2) of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for the amendment, in the light of the discussions we have had, are obvious. It is not at all unusual for charities, especially local charities, to let part of their premises for a short term. They might let
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
a couple of rooms for six months. Often they sub-let to other voluntary organisations at less than the market price. Under the new clause as drawn they would be able to sub-let only at the best price reasonably obtainable. Such leases would not be covered by the exception in subsection (8) (b), as I read it, which seems to refer only to dispositions to charities with similar objects. There are other charities which have leases from local authorities under terms which provide that if they sub-let, the rent under the sub-lease must be kept down to a certain level. Those charities would not be able to obtain the best price for any sub-lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great many representations have been made by charities which enter into frequent tenancy agreements about the practical difficulties involved in what is set out in the Bill as it now stands. I can give the example of a charity which caters for the blind and the partially sighted. It lets out houses on tenancy agreements at well below the best rents that might be obtained and at levels subsidised out of charity income. The properties are not advertised and there is no point in doing so—which is the point made by the right reverend Prelate. No reports are obtained from surveyors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the amendment is to keep alive the requirement that if the disposition is to a connected person as defined in the first schedule, there is a requirement and a duty to obtain proper advice so as to avoid any suspicion of hanky-panky. However, the charity would be relieved of the full rigours of subsection (3) in the case of short leases following the definition in the 1960 Act. Without such an amendment the operation of the clause would cause enormous difficulties of a kind which cannot have been contemplated by the Government and which do not justify so substantial a departure from the present law. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, particularly with regard to short leases and small charities. Those not only enact the policies of such charities but frequently - and the noble Lord has given some instances and we could all give others—are good business, sound management and very good value for money. To have a second level of advice which is not so onerous as the full panoply and majesty of what is proposed in the Bill is surely good business in encouraging good management by the charities themselves. If short leases were not required to comply with all requirements there would be far more opportunity for small charities in particular to do good business. It would certainly aid the practical, day-to-day operation of those charities and I hope that the noble Earl will accept that and take the idea away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am by nature a charitable chap and I shall certainly consider the very valid points that have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Allen, and the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, about the burdens which fall on charities if the requirements of Clause 33 have to be met in the case of very short
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
leases. The last thing we want to do is place undue burdens upon trustees, but it is necessary that trustees should be responsible for their trusteeship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the previous amendment moved by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester I said that I would consider whether it was possible to exclude leases of less than five years. I am therefore prepared to consider whether we could disapply the provisions of Clause 33 in the case of a lease for a short term. I am not sure that 22 years is the right period. A lease of 22 years is a significant undertaking on the part of the charity. It seems to me to be right that the safeguards of Clause 33 should apply to a lease of that length. I do not believe that the burden would be disproportionate, although I accept that it would be a burden in the case of short leases. I shall certainly consider whether leases under five years can be excluded. I hope that that will meet with the approval of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. However, from the look on his face it does not appear to be meeting with approval. I had thought that I should see a smile from ear to ear but doubtless that will appear in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming increasingly concerned about our progress with the Bill. We are in our fourth day. We have made one amendment, which was carried against the Government, we have made two drafting amendments and we have made no other change. I thought that the whole purpose of the Committee was that as the Bill was not party political and we all agree with its general objects we were to work out in Committee, without party argument, ways and means of ensuring that what is proposed does not present enormous practical problems. For that purpose a number of us have been able to give illustrations of the way in which local small charities in particular might be affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various undertakings have been given and the prospects are of an enormously long Report stage, when part of the purpose of the Committee was to avoid that contingency. We seem to be failing in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is left with the feeling that officials do not understand how small charities work. I do not blame them for that. They have had no chance to gain experience. I freely confess that when I had some responsibility for charity law I was pretty well as ignorant of the practical problems. Although the noble Earl has been even more reassuring in relation to this amendment than others, I believe that the time has come for us to write something into the Bill. If 21 years is wrong - and 21 years is the time set out in the 1960 Act and is not a new invention—I am inclined, in spite of what the Minister has said, to take a stand on the amendment and to press for its adoption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may make one observation before the noble Lord takes such a step. It is entirely up to him to call for a decision whenever he wishes. I would not wish to deny him that privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord said that he was concerned about progress and that we had not written enough into the Bill. It is a non-party Bill. The Government are
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
anxious that the Bill should be as right as possible. I have given a number of undertakings. Those undertakings were genuinely given. I have assured the Committee that the Government will consider the implications of some of the amendments tabled by noble Lords to see whether the Government can envisage a way of improving matters for the future. However, there is another stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, feels we should be a little more robust and that the Committee should call Divisions on certain issues and attempt to insert measures in the Bill. The noble Lord considers this will make for a shorter Report stage. I am not sure he is right about that. The normal practice that the Committee has adopted when Ministers have said they will take away a point to see whether the Government can accommodate it is to accept that as a genuine act of intention. The Committee normally accepts that Ministers will genuinely try to meet the points that have been made. If any Member of the Committee wishes to call a Division on any amendment it is up to him to do so. However, once a decision has been taken, it removes from a Minister any obligation that he may have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the noble Earl has given a number of undertakings. However, those undertakings would have carried greater conviction if the noble Earl had accepted some of the amendments for which an unanswerable case has been made in our discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accepted an argument made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said right at the outset that there had been two drafting amendments. I am sure the noble Earl would agree that, valuable though those amendments were, they did not in any way change the substance of the Bill. I was concerned with matters which, in a small way, changed the policies set out in the Bill. It is only fair to give a warning that as we continue there may be moments when we shall simply have to divide the Committee and vote against the Government. We are reaching provisions which concern fund-raising. I believe the Bill is seriously defective in some places as regards those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still uneasy that the promise is only applicable for five years. We have the precedent of 21 years. The right reverend Prelate expressed some of the reasons why five years seemed to be an inadequate period of time. I would still be happier if this provision were included in the Bill. If on Report the Government wish to amend the period of time by reducing the figure of 21 years and pluck some other figure out of the air, it would be open to them to do so. In spite of all that has been said, I must proceed with my original intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord sits down I hope I may make a plea to him not to push this matter. A period of 22 years seems to me to be rather a long time. I have every sympathy with the noble Lord's discontent at the way in which governments tend to be so excessively defensive in rejecting one idea
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
after another. However, I must add that my noble friend has been most courteous in his handling of the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Allen, will defer his opposition until a point where it may become necessary when we are discussing the later stages of the Bill which concern fund-raising. I have serious objections to the proposals on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult not to respond to such a courteous invitation, particularly as it is coupled with reflections about the stubbornness of the Government in dealing with amendments. Part of the trouble is that this is not just a question of adding a period of five years, or whatever it may be. It is important to include in the Bill some of the other provisions that my amendment tries to cover. I shall respond to that courteous request but I sit down with a feeling of considerable unhappiness. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 50C:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 30, line 22, leave out ("subsection (7)") and insert ("subsections (7) and (7A)").</p></blockquote>
The right reverend Prelate said: I speak on behalf of the right reverent Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury. In moving this amendment I speak also to Amendments Nos. 51ZA, 51AA and 51AB, which contain the relevant definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to provide a limited exception to the provision in Clause 33(6) for giving public notice of a proposed transaction. The amendments apply only to extremely short leases of two years or less. They extend only to the Church bodies of which I have spoken before on Amendment No. 50B; that is, diocesan boards of finance, diocesan trustee bodies, parochial church councils and incumbents and church wardens. The object of the amendment is certainly not to avoid public scrutiny. The Church should not be exempt from such scrutiny in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the bodies that the amendment covers are accountable in some way or other within the Church's own system of government. The amendment seeks to ensure that there is efficient management of Church property. The Church should be quick to take an opportunity to raise some money from a lease which is so temporary that it cannot have any real impact on those who rightly take an interest in the property and the way it is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be boring to discuss the kind of situations I have in mind. I have already mentioned the example in a parish of a curate's house that may be standing empty. If the Church can lease that property quickly, in a matter of weeks, that could be to the advantage of everyone concerned, especially someone wanting a roof over his head. There would be no question of parishioners being deprived of the use of an asset on more than the most temporary basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modest amendment and it is restricted to a certain class of Church bodies. If, in moving this amendment, I benefit other charities, that will make me extremely pleased. I hope I have made my point by applying this measure particularly to the situations I
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
have described. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, may say he wishes to take the amendment away and consider a rather wider amendment extending to leases for up to two years by any charity. I would certainly not object to that provision. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for explaining his concern. On a previous amendment I said I would be prepared to take this matter away and consider whether we could not disapply the requirements of Clause 33 in the case of a lease of five years or less. If we are able to do that, the kind of leases which the right reverend Prelate has in mind in this amendment will be excluded because they involve a period of time of less than five years. I hope the right reverend Prelate will accept that the undertaking I gave on a previous amendment also applies to this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 51:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 30, line 32, after ("mentioned") insert:</p></blockquote>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>("(a) if consequent upon any representation to the Commissioners by any person interested in the land to be disposed of the Commissioners shall order that the disposition shall not be proceeded with or shall not be proceeded with unless the conditions set out in the Order shall be complied with;</li>
	<li>(b)").</li></div> <!-- ul -->
The noble Lord said: As I think we are by now all well aware in the light of the debates we have already had on these clauses, under the 1960 Act all charities that wish to dispose of charity land must obtain an order from the Charity Commission. Clause 33 dispenses with the need for an order but lays down a procedure that must be adopted by the trustees before a disposition of land. There is some concern in the charitable world that in future trustees could sell charity land where that was not in the best interests of a charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment introduces an additional safeguard so that any person interested in the land, for example a beneficiary of the charity, could make representation to the commissioners. The commissioners would then look at all the circumstances and if they were so minded issue an order prohibiting the sale or imposing conditions. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By leave of the Committee, perhaps I may speak to Amendments Nos. 51A and 51B. They are grouped together and relate to much the same concern as that raised by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. It might be for the convenience of the Committee for me to give my arguments at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the noble Lord, I too am very concerned about the removal of the involvement of the Charity Commissioners in such sales and dispositions. I have had experience of their assistance and help in such matters; they have been of tremendous benefit. Again I come back to the question of small charities administered by country people whose experience and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
knowledge of what may be intricate matters cannot be expected to be as extensive as perhaps in the care of trustees of a larger charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trustees very often are appointed by deed or by an 	<i>ex officio</i> appointment—for instance, the vicar of a parish or the owner of surrounding land; or indeed there may be a fall-back situation. In my case the Warden of Keble College, Oxford, was automatically a trustee if there were not any other appointees. What on earth the dear Warden in Oxford might have known about anything in the north of Yorkshire I do not understand. He just happened to be a great friend of my grandfather at the time. I am not sure that a trustee can exercise quite the expertise in such potential dispositions as perhaps might be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall some years ago when such a disposition became absolutely necessary because of a total lack of funds to maintain the edifice of our village hall. Quite rightly, that upset a number of villagers because they were not quite certain where they were going to hold their meetings and so on. But I am glad to say that, with the assistance of the Charity Commissioners, the trustees were able to explain the reasons and that it was all above board. There was no come-back on the unfortunate vicar. My shoulders are broad enough probably, but it would have been rather unfair on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment goes further than the noble Lord's amendment. I should like to ensure that we do not remove the involvement of the commissioners in the disposal of land or buildings where they are occupied by a charity. I do not refer to land and buildings which may be part of the investment portfolio of a charity; I mean where they are occupied. I am thinking of almshouses, schools, museums and other things of that sort. I should like to see that continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if my noble friend and the Government cannot accept having to go so far as that, then the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, is valid about anybody who may have an interest, either a beneficiary or an occupant of an almshouse or whatever who may see that the roof is going to be sold over their head. If they have the power to make a representation and the commissioners have the power to step in, I would support the amendment and hope that the Committee would support it very strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to sound like Robin Hood in this Committee, perpetually protecting the weak of the world against the enormous powers being taken by the Govesrnment. Certainly the Warden of Keble College, Oxford, could never be described as anything like that. But this amendment commends itself to me because it provides small charities and little people with something like a court of appeal, which in this case I believe to be necessary. The amendment is to compensate for the fact that Clause 33(6) does not protect against circumstances in which trustees disregard local representations, however well founded they may be. It would give the Charity Commission discretion—no more than that—to intervene. So far as I can see, that improves the regulatory and monitoring powers of the Charity Commission, which is surely a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal first with Amendment No. 51. Clause 33(6) puts forward additional requirements to be fulfilled by charity trustees in disposing of land which is held 	<i>in specie</i> -that is, within the overall objects of the charity. That kind of land is often central to the existence of the charity and the disposition could radically alter the nature of the charity and its ability to provide continuing benefits. Almshouses are a good example of charities which hold land 	<i>in specie.</i>
For those reasons I think it right that the trustees should be subject to additional safeguards in order to ensure that the charity's property is not disposed of in a improper way. That is what subsection (6) seeks to do. It does so by ensuring that trustees give public notice of their intention to dispose of the property and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the intention behind the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, but I am not sure that enabling a person who is interested in the disposal to make representations to the commissioners and then for the commissioners to prevent a disposition adds a further real safeguard. If the person who is interested in the land has a pecuniary interest, it would not be appropriate for the commissioners to become involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioners would not be able to determine a disputed title and it would fall to such an interested person to seek redress through the general law. But if, on the other hand, the interested person is a beneficiary of the charity—for example, it might be an almshouse resident—then the commissioners would seem to be somewhat superfluous. All that the commissioners would be able to do in response to those kinds of representations would be to ensure that the trustees of the charity concerned had the power to sell the property in question, that they were selling it for the best possible price and that they complied with the requirements set out in Clause 33. Of course the trustees must meet those three requirements, but the law would require them to do that in any event, whether or not the commissioners are involved. That is the purpose of Clause 33.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may turn now to Amendments Nos. 51A and 51B to which my noble friend Lord Mountgarret spoke. These are rather more wide-ranging that Amendment No. 51. They seek to exclude all charity property which is held 	<i>in specie</i> from the new provisions relating to dispositions of charity property and those relating to the mortgaging of such property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in Clauses 33 and 35 are designed to ensure that all trustees go through the kinds of steps that they are required to go through now if they wish to dispose of or mortgage their property. The only difference would be that the commissioners or the court will not be required to sanction the action of the trustees, but the provisions of the clauses which I mentioned represent an adequate set of safeguards to ensure that charity property is not disposed of illegitimately or otherwise contrary to the law. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
makes the operation rather more simple because it means that it is not necessary to have the commissioners' sanction on every disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I hope that the Committee will agree that the provisions in the Bill satisfactorily deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend referred to Amendments Nos. 51A and 51B. Perhaps I may come back to him on this point. I am not terribly happy about his answer. Let us take this scenario. A property is being occupied and used by beneficiaries who are entitled to enjoy the benefit of the charity. Suddenly the trustees in their wisdom feel that they are sitting on an asset, let us say for the sake of argument worth £½ million, and the liquid funds and income are very small to maintain and run that property. Our village hall had to go for that very reason. However, there can be occasions—I regret to say it—when some trustees might say, "We simply haven't the time to struggle on with this property. We cannot do so. We shall be much better off if we sell the whole thing, collect £½ million, and invest it at a good rate of interest. We shall dole out money to aid and assist the people who would have lost the benefit, in particular, of occupation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind the inhabitants of almshouses. One could generate a further pressure on other housing authorities to try to rehouse people. I suspect that the inhabitants of those buildings and houses would be far happier to remain in their residences, albeit on a small level of income, rather than to have to find alternative accommodation at their time of life—most of them are elderly—and to be given a grant or financial assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Harris, provides for, and is of assistance to, those very people who feel that will suffer. They can approach the appropriate authority—in this case presumably it is the Charity Commission—which will then watch carefully what the trustees do. The trustees would then have to make out a first-class case as to why they wished to dispose of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that my amendments go a little further than that of the noble Lord, Lord Harris, and might be difficult for my noble friend to accept. However, I hope that at the very least he will say that he is prepared to consider the point again and will put forward a provision at Report Stage which is acceptable to the Government and which safeguards the very people whose interests should have greater protection. I hope that the Committee will agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harris, and me on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two principles that we should consider. The Act is designed to give trustees of charities greater freedom in terms of the way in which they act in relation to the trust property. I have no quarrel, or indeed complaint, with that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 51A involves the second of those principles: that is, whether or not the Charity Commission should have the right to call in a proposed sale if there are proper grounds on which it might be called in so that the commission can consider it and hold up the sale during the period that such consideration took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
I do not see very much wrong with that proposal. As a residual power which the Charity Commission could exercise in appropriate circumstances so that it could delay the sale until it was satisfied that the sale was in the best interest of the charity, and of the beneficiaries in particular, it seems sensible. I am a little surprised that the Government have not been able to smile upon it rather more than they have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to beware of thinking that small is beautiful and necessarily good. I have some sympathy with the Government in the way in which they have drafted these tightening-up clauses. Indeed, the whole purpose of the reform of charity law was to do just that. There is no doubt that a good deal of slackness has crept into the administration of charities. The temptations to be slacker may be greater when the charities are small and the trustees know each other and make assumptions about delegating their work to them or otherwise having an easier time than trustees of larger charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 33 and 34 make provision for the tightening up process. It must be rather disappointing for the Government, having turned the screw as hard as they think circumstances justify, to find that the Committee seeks to relax the full rigours of what they attempt to provide in these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we shall have more of such discussions before we finish debating these clauses. It will be said that they go too far or do too much, or that there should be some discretion, and so on. Perhaps those debates will offer the opportunity for all of us to consider how much more rigorous we wish the charity law to be and whether we shall extend the relaxation of provisions over a wider area or deeper into particular transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disposition of property is probably one of the most important tasks with which charities have to deal. Many problems arise in that connection which do not arise when simply making a money gift or bestowing the benefits of a charity upon those intended to receive them. There are dangers in slackness in delegation. We give way far too easily into becoming trustees. Sometimes we say, "As long as there is no work attached to it, I don't mind giving my name to what you are doing". But that is not the right approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However we leave the law, it must make the position of trustees more responsible and make them more conscious of their responsibility. They must not take on the task if it will intrude in their leisure or business time. However, at the same time we have to deal with the large mass of charities in existence. We are not creating a new organisation. We are dealing with live trustees—at least, most of them are alive ! —in the disposition of property and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger in excessive delegation. When I was on the Royal Commission on standards of conduct in public life, one of the frequent sources of corruption was the decisions of planning committees to vest sole discretion in the chairman of the planning committee of the local authority to exercise personal responsibility for giving planning permission on amounts or areas up to a certain limit. We discovered
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
that it was a give-away system. It should never have been conducted like that. Members of committees and trustees cannot just go home and leave someone else with the responsibility that they ought to share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to help. A poor old layman is trying to have a go. We are not in a state of acute difference. It is a matter of degree. We have two considerations to bear in mind. First, what shall be the regime for the future? There are charities still to come. We want those charities yet to come to be better than many charities in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want to make life at least tolerable for many charities which have a certain tradition and convention in their practices which will feel that what we require of them is particularly irksome. There must be a basis for agreement somewhere. I know that my noble friend Lord Allen of Abbeydale wants to have something on the scorebook. However, sometimes if you achieve a draw, it is quite a decent match. If we achieve that, perhaps the Government will wish to consider over the wider area of the two clauses whether, in total, they are excessively exacting on trustees or whether relaxations can be made which will be to the Committee's satisfaction. We do not like to hear Members of the Committee, whom we greatly respect for their reasonableness, intelligence and knowledge, confessing that they are dissatisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by agreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, that on this, as on other matters we have discussed, there are no acute differences between us. I accept also what he says about the dangers of slackness. The purpose of the amendment is not to increase the degree of slackness but to increase the accountability of trustees; in other words, it has the reverse effect in terms of inducing slackness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether, in a situation involving almshouses, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, referred, or an issue on which there could be strong local feeling on the part of people who have an interest in a charity, there would be no final court of appeal beyond the trustees themselves who, in terms of the issue, would be self-interested. They would have made a provisional decision that something should be done which was the cause of great local anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment proposes that there should be a right of appeal to the Charity Commission. I cannot see what are the difficulties about that. No doubt there are difficulties and it would require a review of the balance of the commission's work. I concede that. However, I should find it of assistance if the noble Earl could direct our attention towards that question. What damage would be done were the amendment to be carried? I find that rather difficult to understand and I should be grateful for his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in quite a difficult position. Some Members of the Committee have referred to the draconian powers of investigation and so on which are being given to the commissioners and this amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
proposes that powers should be almost delegated. In the past, if land or property was to be sold it was necessary to obtain the approval of the commissioners. We are now saying that provided various steps are undertaken that is not necessary. The difference is that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, wants the commissioners to have power to stop the sale. However, the charity trustees must work out what is in their best interests. They must be responsible for what they do. If it is in the interests of the charity for that sale to proceed, it is for the trustees to take that decision and ensure that the various hoops, as I have described them, are gone through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the trustees of the charity to manage it as best they can. It may be that the best way of achieving that objective would be, in the example given by my noble friend Lord Mountgarret, to sell the property and to use the proceeds of sale in accordance with the trust provided that they act within the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Harris, wants the Charity Commissioners to say, "No, you must not do that." Therefore, this amendment suggests that the Charity Commissioners should have an overriding power over the trustees. Provided that the trustees are acting within and according to the law, I do not believe it is right to give a superior power of decision to the Charity Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Richard, was concerned that the commissioners should have adequate power. They have adequate powers to intervene in a sale if it is brought to their attention that the trustees are not complying with the trusts, powers or statutory obligations. In that case they can conduct an investigation and can take action if they find that the trustees are at fault. The commissioners cannot take steps to stop a sale if the trustees are acting in accordance with the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of disagreement between us, if there is one, between us is that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, seeks to give additional power to the commissioners to override the powers of the trustees. Our whole philosophy behind the Bill is to give responsibility to the trustees provided that it is carried out correctly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the noble Earl tell me where we find the statutory power of intervention by the Charity Commissioners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord will find the powers in Sections 6 and 20 of the 1960 Act.

The noble Viscount said: We have discussed the broad principle of this amendment with the previous amendment. However, that went further because it referred to all land and property which could be deemed to be part of the investment portfolio of the charity. Perhaps it is not right for the Charity Commissioners to hold an overriding brief over the trustees. This amendment refers to where the land or buildings are occupied by beneficiaries which is a rather different matter. My noble friend referred to what, in the view of the trustees, appears best for the charity. There can be occasions when what appears right to the trustees, whether for reasons of ease or convenience, is not necessarily right for the charity or the beneficiaries of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend said that it does not appear to him right that the Charity Commissioners should have an overriding power and that we are seeking to give them additional powers. That is not so. They already have those powers under the Charities Act 1960. The number of commissioners has increased fairly substantially and it seems to me that they will now be asked to do rather less work. That is another point. I am anxious about situations where people are occupying the land and I should like to know what are the views of the Committee on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the same point as applied to the previous amendment.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
The Government have promised fairly substantial amendments to this clause. I wish to make two points in that regard. The first concerns the activities of the charity which I mentioned. It lets out houses to blind people at subsidised rents, which is a good thing. Will that activity remain possible after any revision of the clause? Secondly, the clause seems to be aimed specifically at sales by private treaty. It occasionally happens that a charity will decide that the best way of proceeding is by auction. I am doubtful whether the clause as drafted contemplates such a procedure. In particular, how would subsection (3) (c) relate to sales by auction when it might involve setting a reserve price which it could well be argued did not represent the best terms that might be available? If one were driven to selling at the reserve and the buyer knocked down the price and later wished to renege, he might well argue that the sale was 	<i>ultra vires.</i> I do not want an immediate answer to the point but I should like to put it on record. Perhaps the Government can consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: My noble friend Lord Prior, who is not a Member of the Committee, has asked me to move Amendment No. 51C. It arises from the recommendation of the Archbishop's Commission on Rural Areas—the commission of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury—of which my noble friend Lord Prior was chairman. The legal background to this is a little complicated but I can put it quite simply. Section 29 of the 1960 Act, which is to be repealed, imposed various restrictions on dealing in charity property. However, Clause 36 of the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
enables the consent of the commissioners or of the court to be dispensed with in various circumstances which are set out in Clause 36, including dispositions of land under the Education Acts of 1944 or 1973. This amendment would add another circumstance. It is a circumstance which arises under Section 112(1) of the Education Reform Act 1988. It does so in the words clearly set out in the amendment, to which I shall refer in detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for the amendment arises because of a situation that occurs all too often in rural England, as I happen to know from my own experience of once having represented a huge rural constituency. Many church schools have served in the past and continue to serve at the present as village halls and village schools. When they become redundant as village schools they have under the present law to be sold on the open market. The proceeds of sale go to the diocese in order to maintain church schools, nearly always elsewhere in the diocese. The village therefore loses its village hall and its school. That is sad because very often—in fact I would say in most cases—when those schools were built generations ago it was the people in the village whose efforts and generosity largely enabled funds to be raised in order for the schools to be built. Surely this situation should be dealt with. A compromise is needed and it was recommended by the Archbishop's commission. The amendment embodies that compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the detail of the amendment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of section 112(1) 'new provision' may, on the application of the relevant diocesan authorities, or of the trustees, or former trustees, of the school concerned, or of not less than six persons over 18 years of age residing in the relevant area of benefit",</p></blockquote>
may cover,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sale of the school at less than the best price obtainable in the open market to a charity operating in the said area of benefit"—</p></blockquote>
that really means the same parish—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and whose objects serve the said area of benefit".</p></blockquote>
The amendment then deals with what should be done with the proceeds of the sale. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of part of the proceeds of any sale for charitable purposes in the said area other than for the purposes of the school concerned".</p></blockquote>
In other words, one can use part of the proceeds obtained at less than the market price for the purpose of building a village hall or it may be possible, although I am not sure that the amendment would permit it—that would be considered if the principle were accepted by the Government—for the proceeds of sale to be put towards buying back the village hall, the school having been sold. It is a little complicated to that extent. However, I hope that I have deployed the need for a provision on these lines and the principle underlying it well enough for my noble friends in charge of the Bill and Members of the Committee to realise that this is a problem which in fairness to people living in villages should be dealt with. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to' extend the powers of the Secretary of State in exercising his jurisdiction to make new provisions for the amendment of conditions relating to certain voluntary schools and grant-maintained schools
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
which have ceased to be used. My noble friend has pointed out that it is proposed that the Secretary of State be authorised to permit the school premises to be sold at less than the best price available to any charity which operates in the school's area of benefit, which as my noble friend said in effect meant the village, and to allow the proceeds of the sale to be used for purposes other than educational purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my noble friend that the legal background is complicated. However, the amendment affects the jurisdication of the Secretary of State for Education and Science in relation to the use of the environment of certain disused schools. The sales of those schools and the use of the proceeds are at present dealt with by the Secretary of State. He makes provision for the proceeds from the sale of such property to be applied for educational purposes. Clearly, a school exists primarily for educational purposes. So it could be argued, and we would argue, that it is right that when a school closes down the proceeds of the sale of the premises should continue to be available to advance education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend referred to the loss of a village hall and a village school and the fact that such schools were frequently the result of the generosity of people years ago. They provided the money and built the school and the children of the village benefited from their generosity. I can understand the view that, where school premises which are no longer needed for educational purposes have been used by local charities or other groups in the absence of other facilities, it should be possible for the premises to be sold to those other groups, or to one of them, at less than the full market value. However, there is a difficulty. If we allow other local charities to benefit in that way from discontinued schools, we should be allowing the primary educational purpose of the school trust to become subservient to other purposes. It seems to us that that would be unfair to those who stand to benefit from the continued use of the proceeds of sale for educational purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty under which we all labour is that when such buildings were built there were two elements of trust. First, the building was built for the benefit of the village, and, secondly, the children of the village were educated. In our view, if the school is disposed of, the money raised ought to continue to be used for the education of children even though those children may be in a larger school which probably provides better facilities, more teachers and even a swimming pool and a larger playground. Those children who would have been educated in the village school will now be educated in other schools where such facilities are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Renton is concerned that the property which was built for the village ought to be used for the village because in his view the generosity was intended for the village. Therefore there is a dichotomy here. We are of the view that as the prime purpose for building a school is an educational one, if the venue in which that education has taken place is now no longer needed, the funds from that sale should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
continue to be used for educational purposes. I see that that is a different view from the one which my noble friend has adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend for his very clear exposition of the somewhat conventional view—and it is not always bad to be conventional—which has been held until now. However, when a highly respected commission appointed by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury, which has a great interest in education in church schools, expresses a different view, it is a matter which we should consider with great respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my noble friend Lord Prior will wish to consider what has been said in the Committee today and he may wish to return to the matter at Report stage. If he does so he will certainly have my support. In the meantime I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 36 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 37 agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 51D:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>After Clause 37, insert the following new clause:</p>
	<p>	<i>("Amendment of Trustee Investments Act 1961</i></p>
	<p>.—(1) Section 2 of the Trustee Investments Act 1961 shall be amended as follows—</p>
	<p>(2) In subsection (1) after "equal in value at the time of division" there shall be inserted "or in the case of a charity in such other proportion as the Secretary of State may specify in regulations".</p>
	<p>(3)In subsection (3) (b) after "increased by the same amount" there shall be inserted "or in the case of a charity in such other amount as the Secretary of State may specify in regulations". ").</p>
	<p>The noble Lord said: I suggest that we take Amendments Nos. 51D, 51E and 51F together. The three proposed new clauses are designed to take charities' investment powers outside the provisions of the Trustee Investments Act 1961, replacing what we see as the outdated restrictions of that Act with regulations which would be made by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p>The Trustee Investments Act was originally seen by many as a liberalising piece of legislation which allowed charities to invest up to 50 per cent. of their assets in shares, with 50 per cent. being restricted to gilts. As shares have outperformed gilts by a very substantial margin—in the region of 5 per cent. a year—the Trustee Investments Act has become out of date and costly. The cost to charities has been very substantial indeed. It has been estimated by Phillips and Drew that as a result of the provisions of that Act charities have lost in the region of £400 million a year.</p>
	<p>Trustees will continue to be required under other sections of the Trustee Investments Act to obtain proper advice about their investments so that there is no risk in that regard. The Trustee Investments Act prevents trustees taking what will often be the best investment decision, which will be to invest more than 50 per cent. of their resources in shares.</p>
	<p>At present many large charities are exempted from the Trustee Investments Act, having obtained individual schemes from the Charity Commissioners.
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
It is mainly medium-sized charities which are losing that formidable amount of money. This is not a matter in which case-by-case consideration makes a great deal of sense. What is needed is a general power.</p>
	<p>The Bill as a whole is intended to improve the supervision of charities and increase the responsibilty of trustees. The amendments are in that same spirit, transferring a restricted statutory provision to the more flexible format of regulations. I beg to move.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although for reasons which I went into earlier and shall not repeat now I cannot applaud the drafting of Amendment No. 51D, I believe that the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, deserve support. It cannot be other than helpful that the Secretary of State should have power to specify investments and to restrict the proportion of a trust's assets which can be invested unless such powers given under regulations are specifically excluded by the trust deeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I believe that the power given to trustees to delegate the investment powers is a perfectly reasonable one. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee as I have a burgeoning confidence that when my noble friend is confronted with this amendment he will see, without the possibility of argument, how reasonable it is and how constructive the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, is being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, has spoken. I believe the noble Lord meant to refer to the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I meant to refer to the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendments that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has tabled. As the noble Lord said, when the Trustee Investments Act 1961 was introduced, it was a liberalising measure. I believe it was warmly accepted by everyone. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, said he thought charities had been subjected to a lot of opportunity cost and that they had lost a great deal of money. I believe Phillips & Drew has estimated an annual cost of £400 million a year. However, no one knows how many trusts, whether charitable or otherwise, are bound by the 1961 Act. Therefore, any figure given for the amount of money lost can, at best, be no more than an educated guess. I do not know how that figure is arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper which preceded the Bill acknowledged that some of the provisions of the 1961 Act were out of date and that reform was desirable. The White Paper concluded that a Charities Bill was not the right vehicle for such a reform. The 1961 Act provides an investment framework for the trustees of charities and private trusts where the trust deed does not permit wider powers of investment. A number of commentators have over the years expressed the view that this framework is unnecessarily restrictive. There have been calls for reform of the Act from the Law
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
Reform Committee and from others. Therefore, it is not surprising that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has tabled this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all these calls for reform the important point to note is that they have all concerned reform of the 1961 Act as it applies to all trustees, whether of charitable or private trusts. To single out for reform the provisions of the Act as they apply to charity trustees alone would be inequitable and in some ways unsatisfactory. If we follow the route suggested in these amendments we would end up with one set of investment rules for charitable trusts in England and Wales and another for all private trusts and for charitable trusts in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view is that any reform of the 1961 Act should be a wide-ranging reform which gives additional powers to charity trustees and to trustees of private trusts as well. I conclude that the Charities Bill is not an appropriate vehicle for such a fundamental reform of general trust law. However, the Government are anxious to have a general reform of the 1961 Act which would remove the restrictions on the investment powers of charity trustees and trustees of private trusts. In my view, to treat these different trustees in the same manner is the most equitable approach. My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will in due course issue a consultative paper with these proposals for reform of the 1961 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that while I have the greatest sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Harris, is trying to do, he might agree that it would be inequitable to apply a provision to one set of trusts rather than to all of them. The only proper way to apply a provision to all trusts is through the reform of the Act as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the Government are using the argument that this Bill is not the right vehicle to amend the Act. However, the Act we are discussing was passed 30 years ago. Year after year we have been told that it is under review. The noble Earl said that a consultative document might be issued in due course. I hope he can be a little more specific than that and give us some closer estimate of when we can expect some amendment of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I said that under the 1961 Act there are provisions which preclude trustees from investing in other member states in the Community. Surely that matter should be put right before the market without frontiers comes into existence in 1993. We have talked a good deal about tightening up the responsibilities of trustees. At the moment the official custodian has some responsibility for ensuring that charities bound by the Act keep to the 50:50 split. A charity of which I am chairman has on a couple of occasions been pulled up for straying over the borders in this matter. Will any policing arrangements come into existence once this Bill is in force, or will that matter be left entirely to trustees, some of whom are not particularly skilled in operations of this kind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, has just said. The arguments deployed against this amendment seem to me to concern basically arguments of tidiness. The theory has been expounded that because a provision cannot now be made to apply to all it must not apply to anyone. Surely we are all agreed that the reform of the 1961 Act is right and proper. We must all agree that an estimated £400 million is a large amount of money. It makes remarkably little difference whether that estimate is right to within 50 per cent. either way. Therefore, we are surely entitled to ask: if a reform is not to be carried out now, when will it be carried out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always been able to keep my admiration for our procedures under strict control. I have not had much difficulty in doing so. I do not lay my next point at the door of my noble friend as it is not his fault at all. However, if one had any grounds for feeling confident that a part of the law which needs to be tidied up would be so tidied up with little delay, it would be a different matter. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, has made a cogent point. My noble friend agreed that the noble Lord had a point and that the law relating to investment by trustees needs to be tidied up. Therefore, I personally see no reason why the path should not be blazed in the cause of charities. I hope that my noble friend will at least take this matter away and bludgeon some of his colleagues in the Government into recognising that there is a point of view on this matter which sharply differs from that of the Government. I absolutely understand the regard which any member of the administration must have for those of his colleagues who are in the Treasury, but that regard is not always universally and totally shared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what my noble friend Lord Peyton has just said. I suppose three-quarters of legislation, including this Bill, seeks to amend bits of other Acts of Parliament. To say that the 1961 Act is going to be amended at some stage, but that cannot be done until we can tackle the matter as a whole, is inconsistent with the way in which legislation is normally operated. Therefore, it is a weak argument to use. I hope my noble friend can take this matter away. and see whether something along the lines of these amendments, which everybody, including my noble friend, has agreed are highly desirable, cannot be put into the Bill at this time</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say just one word about the position into which the Committee may be getting itself. The noble Earl is a past master at handling committees, either the small one that we have in this room or indeed on the Floor of the Chamber. He is charming, gracious, open, courteous and receptive. But for all his receptiveness and openness, when it comes to looking at the final piece of legislation—I do not blame him at all—perhaps the beguiling nature of the way in which he presented himself to the Committee has indeed beguiled us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is just one point that I should like to make. It seems to me that if we are to get any real changes in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
respect of this legislation, it is necessary that the Committee should pass these amendments and that the Government should consider them once they have been passed and then no doubt if they do not like them they can come back at Report stage. Perhaps I may say with great respect to the noble Earl that the fault is not his; it is the fault of others. One admires his good will and good intentions. But, unfortunately, it lies not solely within his authority and power to be able to produce the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be very unhappy indeed if we just asked him to take back the amendment now. It may well be that that is all that would happen: he would take it back and, having done his best, come back again. But the cause would not have been advanced. A vote by this Committee which in fact agreed to this amendment would act as a greater spur on the Government as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For about the first time in my life I am deeply wounded by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, who said that I have a beguiling nature and that I was all the flattering things that he said about me but the fact remained—so he said—that nothing actually appeared in the Bill. But if I have been beguiling it is only in this Committee stage, where I have tried to listen to the arguments and to say that we may not have got it 100 per cent. right but we shall take the arguments away and consider them. We cannot give a guarantee but we will see whether we can meet the noble Lord's wishes. I thought that that showed an accommodating nature. But it is far from the appearance of being beguiling, with the inference that nothing will happen at all. That stance would make it a lot easier for me and for officials, because we need not do anything. But I have no intention of beguiling the Committee. I intend to look at these matters and examine how we can meet noble Lords' wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to another point. My noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil said that I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Harris, in that there is an argument to be made. I did agree with him. My noble friend then went on to ask whether I would use a cudgel with my colleagues in government. I shall have to look up the word to see what one does with a cudgel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may just enlighten my noble friend. I thought very carefully about the word. The justification for its use is that it is not ordinarily a lethal weapon. I do not suggest that a lethal weapon is necessary on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my noble friend's definition. The point is quite a simple one. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harris, and all Members of the Committee. In my personal opinion there is a sound argument for changing the law in this respect. Where we differ is in whether it is right and proper to do it in this Bill, in which one would be altering the law as it refers only to charitable trusts and excluding a similar provision for other trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Mottistone said that it is not inconsistent to alter the law. But indeed it is, because this Bill will be a financial Act and what we are concerned with is altering charities. In this case we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
altering financial law. I think that there is a sound argument for saying that if that is done, it must be done fairly and across the board, so that it refers to all trusts, whether or not they are charitable. That is the only difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, asked when that document would be forthcoming. I cannot go any further than I did. I cannot tell him when it will be available. I can only tell him that it is the Government's intention to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has a fairly simple decision to make on this question. First of all, there is no disagreement on the question of principle. The noble Earl indicated that he is at one with the general objective of what we are trying to do. The problem is the secondary issue; namely, whether in fact we shall pass by the opportunity of righting this wrong so far as concerns the charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being invited to agree that the Economic Secretary will at some unspecified time in the future be good enough to publish a consultative document. When pressed as to when that document would be published, the noble Earl said, perfectly reasonably, that he did not know and no doubt it would be as soon as possible. But nothing will speed up the publication of that consultative paper more than the passage of these amendments today. That is the question: whether in fact we shall pass by this opportunity of giving the trustees of charities the opportunity—certainly following regulations drafted by the Secretary of State—to apply their resources in the way that they want to and not on the basis of this statute, which frankly has undoubtedly cost them a very substantial sum of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>After Clause 37, insert the following new clause:</p>
	<p>	<i>("Regulations for investment of property of charity</i></p>
	<p>.—(1) The Secretary of State may make regulations to specify investments which shall be authorised for the investment of property of any charity.</p>

	<p>The noble Lord said: Again, I have already spoken to the amendment. I beg to move.</p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clauses 38 to 40 agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the view of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, but perhaps I may suggest that we adjourn at this stage rather than go to the next amendment. Perhaps I may leave it to the view of the Committee. Otherwise we shall go well past one o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment stands in the name of my noble friend Lady Faithfull who is not present. Perhaps someone will be moving it on her behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend asked me to move the amendment. It will not take time. It is a point on which I am sure the Government will long to agree with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 41 [	<i>Small charities: power to transfer all property, modify objects etc.</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 52:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 36, line 19, leave out ("by a unanimous resolution") and insert ("by a resolution passed by a two thirds majority").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: On behalf of my noble friend Lady Faithfull, I beg to move Amendment No. 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have come to small charities. We find that for the most part small charities are run by people of
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
modest pretensions. We are insisting that the opportunities for a little more flexibility which these measures provide shall always be done by unanimous resolution of the trustees. The provision does not state whether it is a resolution of those present, of those voting, or of the total voters whether or not they happen to be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let us realise that very often on these small charities there will be an elderly man—a nice old buffer—who may have been a trustee for 50 years. He is resolutely opposed to any change. He may be a man of some intellect, but surely it is absurd that he should have a veto. I suggest that the Government would wish to reconsider the provision. A two-thirds majority would seem about right. It should be a two-thirds majority of those present and voting. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say how delighted I was to hear my noble friend Lord Renton identify that the problem was likely to be a male on committees. However, I ask that the Government consider the issue because the problem which restricts the charity is likely to be inside the charity. Such a provision would be for the benefit of the trustees overall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many years ago it was decided to introduce majority verdicts in courts. One of the principal reasons for doing so was because of the problems caused by the single recalcitrant juror. The problem is that if one insists on unanimity there is a real risk that some rather tiresome trustee will impose what is in reality a veto. It seems to me that a two-thirds majority is about right. I very much hope that the noble Earl will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the intention behind the amendments which is to make the provisions of Clauses 41 and 42 more widely available than those of the Charities Act 1985. That is the very reason why we ourselves are making significant amendments to the 1985 Act in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resolutions under Clauses 41 and 42 will be major steps for a charity. A resolution under Clause 41 will enable the trustees, for example, to transfer all of the charity's property to another charity. A resolution under Clause 42 will enable the trustees to spend the capital of the charity as if it were income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the point made by my noble friend Lord Renton about what one perhaps may call the old buffer who is not moved by the arguments of more sensible trustees, if the trustees cannot agree to act unanimously one or more of them can apply to the commissioners under Section 18 of the 1960 Act for a scheme to achieve similar ends as those that might be achieved under Clauses 41 and 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any of these steps may fundamentally change the nature of a charity by transferring its property to another charity, amending its objects or by allowing it to expend its capital. In such circumstances, it seems to me only right and proper that charity trustees should act in concert and in agreement. However, as I said before, if they cannot act in agreement they can apply to the commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at that—I hesitate to use the expression—heavy weather approach. I do not wish to divide the Committee because I am sure that my noble friend Lady Faithful] will wish to consider the matter. However, I suggest that this is a matter in which the Government will find themselves in a regrettable position in two or three years time if they do not concede the amendment. They will give nothing away by accepting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather alarmed. There is a vast amount of experience and expertise among Members of the Committee. However, the judgment, individual and collective, of the Government seems to be to prefer the approach of their advisers, who may not have anything like the expertise or experience of Members of the Committee. I suggest that this is a typical example of their approach. We are trying to improve the charity law which has stood its ground fairly well for 30 years. The 1960 Act is to remain broadly in place. My goodness, after all those years surely we
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
should be thinking in rather more practical terms than we were able to apply our minds to 30 years ago. I must not go on because we have reached the time beyond which we normally sit. However, with great dismay, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord sits down, he has made a convincing case.
