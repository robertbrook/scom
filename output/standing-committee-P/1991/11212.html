<div class='page-header'><h1>CHARITIES BILL [H.L.]</h1></div>
<time>Thursday, 12th December, 1991</time>
<p><b>The Committee met at ten o'clock.</b></p>
<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>
<p>Clause 58 [<i>Professional fund-raisers etc. required to specify institutions benefiting and arrangements for remuneration</i>]:</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 73 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 74:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 49, line 44, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>("the format of this statement to be established as is prescribed by regulations made by virtue of section 62(2) (d), after the broadest possible consultation with charities, the NCVO, the ICFM and other appropriate bodies.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 78 and 80. The way a clear and accurate statement is worded will be critical to the success or failure of fund-raising. There should therefore be the broadest possible consultation between the Secretary of State and the charitable sector as to how this statement might be worded. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the anxieties behind this amendment. The requirement for a clear and accurate statement appears to be a daunting one. Fund-raisers may be unsure in particular circumstances whether any statement they might make falls within the law. I have been exploring ways in which the requirements of Clause 58 might be mitigated, and I intend to introduce amendments to that end before the next stage of the Bill.<br><br>
In the meantime, I do not think that my noble friend's amendments are the best way forward. It seems to me that the Secretary of State would be faced with an impossible task in determining in regulations exactly what information should be disclosed by a professional fund-raiser or a commercial participator in any given circumstance. There are a multitude of different forms of fund raising, and I do not see how the Secretary of State could legislate for all of them.<br><br>
It seems preferable to keep this requirement a general one, so that the fund-raiser or participator himself can satisfy himself in his particular circumstances, whether or not any statement made by him meets the requirements of Clause 58. I do not think that that should be difficult. I agree with my noble friend's concern that the Government should consult widely in drawing up regulations when the Bill becomes law. I have said before, and I am happy to repeat now, that we will consult to ensure that regulations under Clause 62 of the Bill are as near right as we can get them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend for his assurances. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendments Nos. 75 to 77 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p>[<i>Amendments Nos. 78 to 80 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 80A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 50, line 35, at end insert ("where that payment is in excess of £50 or such other amount as may be specified from time to time by the Secretary of State.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment will save a great deal of money being wasted on unnecessary bureaucratic procedures. It is right that donors and potential donors, just as those who order on credit cards in a totally different field, should be protected and given a chance to think again; particularly when appeals are being made to the emotions, as they often are by charities. But it is carrying the matter too far for a great deal of money to be spent on making absolutely sure that all those who promised money, including those who have given regularly in the past, have the chance to rethink their situation, when the sums involved are very small.<br><br>
The amendment suggests that £50, which I think is the same sum as is used with regard to the sale of goods, is a worthwhile minimum. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. All those who have talked to me about this matter have stressed that in one charity after another, large and small, around 75 per cent. of income derives from small amounts—£5 notes here and there, £5 donations here and there. To be obliged to go through an enormous amount of bureaucracy every time will strangle the entire system. Many people have expressed their worries about it. If the Bill remains as presently drafted, confusion will both prevent, go before us, and further us. It is important that we should give this relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendment has great merit in limiting the administrative problems of charities and their agents I wonder whether it is in some respects right to set a limit that cannot be changed because of the changing values of money. Very soon the position would be ridiculous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That problem could be dealt with by a further amendment at a later stage of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. There should be a lower limit on charitable donations which can be recovered by the donor. I should have thought that £50 is reasonable. The amendment states,
<br><blockquote><p>"or such other amount as may be specified from time to time by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
The figure can be altered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, I support the amendment. I understand from the society that it receives an enormous amount of its money in small donations. The amendment would be very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments seek to make a significant change to the arrangements in Clause 59
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0497">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
which will allow donors, in certain circumstances, to obtain a refund of a donation or payment made to a professional fund-raiser or commercial participator.<br><br>
My noble friend Lord Ferrers explained during the Second Reading of the Bill why we think these provisions are important. They provide an additional safeguard for the interests of the donor who may respond generously to an emotive appeal but who later realises that the donation he has made is financially untenable for him. Clause 59 therefore provides a cooling off period for the donor who makes a payment with a credit or debit card in response to appeals made by television, radio or telephone. As my noble friend said at Second Reading, such appeals can have an emotional impact which clearly justifies such an additional safeguard.<br><br>
Clause 59 will allow a donor to claim a refund whatever the amount of his donation. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, would limit the availability of a refund only to those cases where a donation was made in excess of £50.<br><br>
I am sure that it would not be right to limit the effect of Clause 59 in this way. A donation of £50 made on the spur of the moment, in response to an emotional appeal, may well cause severe financial problems for a person of modest means. To limit the availability of a refund under Clause 59 in the way suggested would be inequitable and would be to prejudice the interests of many donors. However, we have some sympathy with the view that professional fund-raisers of commercial participators should be able to deduct expenses properly incurred in connection with processing refunds, and I shall come forward with an amendment to achieve that before the next stage of the Bill.<br><br>
There is, however, one respect in which it might seem an anomaly. The provisions to be applied to broadcast appeals by professional fund-raisers do not also apply to broadcast appeals by charities acting on their own behalf. That is provision contained in Clause 59 for a cooling off period where a donor makes a payment by credit or debit card. This allows the donor in certain circumstances to cancel his donation or payment. As I have said, broadcast appeals on television or radio can be very emotive. People respond generously. They might then realise that they have responded too generously and cannot, on reflection, afford the amount that they offered. The provision provides a safeguard for the interests of the donor.<br><br>
Is it right that the donor should have a safeguard only where the appeal is made by a professional fund-raiser? Charities can play on the emotions too. We shall consider whether we need to put the broadcast appeal by a charity or charities on the same basis as that made by a professional fund-raiser. On that point we are also considering whether the 14 days should be reduced to seven days in Clause 59(1). We seek to find the right balance for the protection of the donors and in the interests of commendable fund-raising by professionals and charities themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, that was a helpful intervention by the noble Viscount, dealing as it does with around half a dozen different issues on half a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
dozen different amendments. At least it gives us some indication of the way the Government's mind is moving.<br><br>
Perhaps I can concentrate on the amendment in front of us moved by the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley. Two issues arise. One is whether the cooling-off period should apply to all donations; the other is whether £50 is the right limit to apply. No doubt I follow my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris on the point and feel that some cut-off point before the cooling-off period comes into effect is right and desirable. As the noble Viscount says, if everybody under the influence of the emotional fervour of the moment who donates £5 to a television appeal thereafter is entitled to turn round and say, "I want my money back", that would be a little excessive.<br><br>
I am not wedded to the figure of £50 and suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, is not wedded to it either. But on the principle that in relation to small donations the cooling-off period should not apply as a matter of principle I hope that the Committee will accept that. No doubt we can then discuss the issue of whether £50 is the right limit. I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have experience in this matter. Earlier this year a charity in which my family and myself are involved persuaded a distinguished lady to make a broadcast appeal. I manned one of the telephones when the appeal had finished and the telephone responses came in. We raised a considerable amount, and sums were still coming in after three months. There was scarcely any case in which the problem raised by the RSPB occurred. Quite frankly, I should have thought it was a small percentage of the money raised by broadcast appeals and therefore the problem is not large. However, to the extent that it is a problem at all, my view is that the Bill as it is proposed to be modified by the Government will deal with it more than adequately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can make it clear that we are speaking only of payments made by credit or debit card; purely those under Clause 59(1) (a). What is important is not only that the donor has protection but that the charity should not incur any financial loss if it is asked by the donor to make a refund. That is why, as I said earlier, the charity should be able to deduct expenses properly incurred in connection with the processing of refunds. Members of the Committee will appreciate that under the credit or debit card system it is a simple process not only to collect donations but also to make refunds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty. I am crying out for facts. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, does not think it is a big problem. That may or may not be true. Perhaps I can ask the noble Viscount on what evidence he relies that there may or may not be cases of severe hardship in the matter of cooling off and the £50 limit. Has there been a survey, has anybody done any research on it or are we talking anecdotally and off the top of our heads?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0498">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
<p>10.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking in terms of the Bill about protection both for the donors and for the charities. Obviously there are cases where people have suffered hardship, whether through giving to charity or paying hire purchase. We are not looking at specific instances. We are discussing an important principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arguments being put forward are becoming increasingly unrealistic, to put the matter as politely as possible. What happens if someone makes a donation of £5 by means of a credit card? Under the Bill as drafted there would have to be various procedures to allow them to obtain their money back. It is estimated that the minimum cost is somewhere around £1 a letter; that is, 20 per cent. of £5. It is suggested that the charity may be able to recover some of that in certain circumstances.<br><br>
The level recommended by my noble friend is wholly sensible. We can obviously discuss whether £50 is the appropriate figure, as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said. But some minimum figure is sensible. The cost of administering all this will be prodigious, and what is the public benefit to be secured? I hope that the Committee will accept my noble friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Mottistone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend Lord Astor said, I believe, that charities in future may be regulated in broadcast appeals. If that is so it could be detrimental to the NSPCC who advises me on this issue. They have just embarked on a new set of such appeals and the idea that they may now be regulated would seriously affect them and delay their raising funds, which they have to do all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my noble friend responds, perhaps I can say that one may obtain a well-known person to make the appeal who may be a president or vice-president but is not employed by the charity. Do they count as being part of the charity, as a professional fund-raiser or participator or what? It depends on how my noble friend answers as to whether charities in certain circumstances will be affected by the amendment or only when an outside agent does the appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe and hope that we explained that point yesterday. A professional fund-raiser is someone who is paid to do the specific task of professional fund-raising as opposed to someone who happens purely to be paid to be on television in the course of his normal duties. I believe that answers that point.<br><br>
In answer to my noble friend Lord Mottistone, we are not intending to change the basis on which charities make appeals on television. Under the Bill at the moment refunds apply only to appeals by professional fund-raisers. We are suggesting that the refunds should also apply to direct representations by charities on the television as well as by professional fund-raisers. There will then not be an inconsistency between the two.<br><br>
In response to the noble Lord, Lord Harris, £50 is not an inconsiderable amount of money, for example,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
to a pensioner. It is obviously difficult to set any limit. Whatever limit one sets somebody is caught. We are talking of enabling refunds to be made only for credit cards. We will bring forward an amendment so that the expenses incurred by the charity in giving that refund will be deducted from the refund.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Mottistone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my noble friend says. I shall have to read his comments. I am not entirely happy and perhaps between now and the next stage, when the Government are putting together the amendment he refers to, he may like to consult professional fund-raisers who can advise where any weak link exists in what I think he is saying he is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I came to the amendment with an open mind, but the explanation given by the Government persuaded me that it is a good amendment. I support it. Comic Relief says that it is already its practice to refund donations made by a caller within a few weeks if it is asked for a refund. However, it raised another point which is of some relevance. It does not distinguish between contributions by cash and contributions by credit card or debit card. I believe that if the limit were put at £50, or perhaps a little above, it would mean contributions by cash would be treated in exactly the same way as contributions by debit card.<br><br>
It seems absurd that if one pays £5 on a credit card all this paraphernalia is brought in, whereas if one puts in a £5 note nothing happens. I support the principle of the amendment. I should be inclined to go a bit above £50, but that would be better than nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Allen, is being a little less than fair to my noble friend Lord Astor. I believe that it would be easy to argue either for or against the amendment, but I am not sure which side I would support.<br><br>
One point that worries me is the aspect that there are exhibitionists around like someone who gets on the telephone and attracts publicity to himself by making an immensely generous donation. People say, "What a splendid fellow he is" and then he withdraws it afterwards, having always intended to do so. I do not believe that he should get away with that. I have some sympathy with the amendment on that aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Viscount replies, I believe that the difficulty seems to be not the principle of obtaining a refund if one wants one's money back when one is in straitened circumstances but the requirement that the charity should send a notice to all people who donate £1 or £5, or whatever, through a credit card. That seems to be an intolerable burden on the charity, not the requirement that they should make a refund.<br><br>
I should have thought that most responsible charities would make a refund if people asked for one, having had second thoughts or found themselves in straitened circumstances. It is the requirement to send a notice to all these people that seems to me to be a heavy burden on charities, not the principle of the refund.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0499">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
<p><span class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Viscount replies, I wish to raise one matter. I am concerned that there should be some protection in regard to credit cards because of the misuse that there can be of other people's credit cards. People do not keep a tight block on the card within the family and some young person utterly committed to a charity could phone in a donation using a credit card number which is perfectly valid but which was not the intention of the owner. There are also multiple credit card issues within families as well as company credit cards. What if someone chooses to be generous with his company's credit card? There is a need for protection on credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With a company credit card he may be sued and become an ex-employee of the company!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there should be some protection but the question is at what level the protection starts. It seems to me that the noble Baroness was slightly fanciful. If somebody steals my credit card the last thing he is likely to do is to phone in a large donation to a charitable appeal. Usually the intention of the thief in those circumstances is to benefit himself, not to benefit the large and good of a particular charity.<br><br>
Certainly I agree that it could happen within the family. If one of my children takes one of my credit cards and phones in a charitable donation of under £50 I would be aggrieved but I would accept that as part of the abrasions of family life. On the other hand, if the amount is £500 or £5,000 and I could not get it back I should be extremely aggrieved. So a limit must be struck somewhere.<br><br>
The idea that charities should have to go through these hoops for relatively small donations made by credit cards is something I find difficult to accept.<br><br>
The noble Viscount talked about pensioners. The idea of someone living on his old age pension having a credit card anyway, on which he would be able to phone in a donation to charity, seems to me to be a somewhat limited case. There may be people in that situation doing so, but I do not think it is really a massive argument one way or the other.<br><br>
Finally, I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, with great interest. When he was manning the telephone, I have no doubt that it was an interesting experience. He said that it was not a problem. I am not sure what he meant by that. Did he mean that most people said that they would give cash at a later date? Or did he mean that almost all credit card donations that came to him on the telephone were for more than £50? I am not sure what he meant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may answer that. The charity, which happens to have been founded by my wife, concerns making furniture for disabled people. We have had two appeals. The first was about five years ago and it was the most successful broadcast appeal ever made. It raised a considerable sum for the charity.<br><br>
The second appeal was this year and it was also very good but not quite so good as the previous one.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
On both occasions people sometimes sent in cheques or sometimes telephoned in donations by credit cards giving the number. Sometimes they simply did nothing for several weeks and then sent a donation or used their credit card to help us without our knowing, and then the money came in. Although I am in close touch weekly with the charity, I have never yet heard of a single person asking for their donation to be reduced—not once. That is why I say that I think that this problem is not of the dimensions that have been suggested. I hope that that answers the noble Lord's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, except that under this clause people will be invited to withdraw their donations. To that extent, therefore, if someone sends in a credit card donation they will then receive a letter from the charity saying, "Please, if you want to withdraw it then you can". I should have thought that would increase the problem for the noble Lord, Lord Renton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for rising again. Am I right in thinking that the Consumer Credit Act allows a 14 day cooling off period with a <i>de minimis</i> provision of £50? If that is so, it might be relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that many interesting and important points have been made. Perhaps I may deal with some of them. The noble Lord, Lord Allen, said that Comic Relief ring up and offer people refunds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I believe he said that if people ring up then Comic Relief are prepared to make a refund. I had it the wrong way round. The importance of that is that the noble Lord, Lord Allen, should therefore support the Government's amendment, which I said we would bring forward, to allow charities to deduct expenses properly incurred in that respect. That would help charities and not cost them anything. At the moment they are making refunds presumably without being able to deduct expenses.<br><br>
The noble Lord, Lord Allen, asked why there should be a distinction between credit cards and cash. There is an important distinction. If one decides to put cash in an envelope and post it on Monday morning, or write out a cheque and post it, that is quite different. One has thought about it and decided to go ahead, as opposed to a rather quick, instant reaction with the credit card on the telephone. These are two separate matters and we are only talking about credit cards and debit cards here.<br><br>
The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, talked about notice. I believe that she is mistaken, if I may say so. No notice is required, except for telephone appeals under Clause 59(2) or (3), and that does not relate to credit cards.<br><br>
This is obviously an important subject. I have said that we shall bring forward amendments at the next stage. In answer to my noble friend Lord Mottistone, we shall certainly take note between now and then of all the points put to us and we shall consider what Members of the Committee have said. We wish to find

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
the right balance between the donor and the charity so that we manage to be fair to both and at the same time help the charities raise more money.<br><br>
With that explanation I hope that noble Lords will feel able to consider the problem further at Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How tedious can we get? My problem sometimes is to know whether to sit, listen and be bored or to stand up and prolong the proceedings. Heaven alone knows, we are now on the trivia of the Bill. My principle is that if a person wants his money back then he gets his money back. Nobody has the right to say that if one has given £51 one gets it back and if one has given £49 one does not. Moreover, in connection with the reference to consumer legislation by my noble friend Lord Allen of Abbeydale, if one is buying something, asks for one's money back after a cooling off period and one is told, "Not for these small things", at least one has got the goods. In this case one does not get much satisfaction. I oppose the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, might be comforted in his lack of faith in the reduction of inflation by the fact that the passage states:
<br><blockquote><p>"or such other amount as may be specified from time to time by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
If that does not meet the noble Lord's point, I should be happy to come back with some other wording at a later stage of the Bill.<br><br>
We are told that by putting the figure so high people who have severe financial problems may be caught. I hope that I am fairly well known in this Chamber for speaking up as often as I possibly can on behalf of those people in our community who are not very well off, but if we are talking about people who are responding to appeals and who have credit cards, I do not believe that £50 is an unrealistic level.<br><br>
I am extremely grateful for what the Government have said about putting in an amendment about deduction of expenses and shall welcome that at another stage. But it does not meet the point. Indeed, it also involves a waste of money which might otherwise be better spent either by the charities or by the people concerned.<br><br>
The noble Lord, Lord Renton, said that the problem represents a very small percentage. I am quite prepared to believe that, although we do not appear to have any figures available. But it has slightly the resonance of, "Well, ma'am it was only a tiny one!".<br><br>
I believe that this is an important matter of principle. As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, said, we want to find the right balance. We are also in favour of motherhood, charity and virtue. But in this series of amendments I believe that we have found the right balance. I invite the Committee to write this provision into the Bill. If the Committee considers that it is not quite the right balance, though nothing has been said this morning to persuade me that it is not the right balance, we can put in another figure at a later stage.</span></p>

<p>Resolved in the affirmative, and amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 81 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 81E:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 50, line 43, after ("payment") insert (",unless the payment is less than £50, or other such amount as may be specified from time to time by the Secretary of State,").</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>The noble Lord said: I beg to move.</p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 82 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 82A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 51, line 16 after ("shall") insert (",if responsible for or privy to such act or default,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I move this amendment on behalf of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. It is an amendment to subsection (7), on page 51, which attempts to ensure that the professional fund-raiser or commercial participator concerned shall be guilty of an offence only,
<br><blockquote><p>"if he is responsible for or privy to such act or default".</p></blockquote>
It merely, so to speak, aims the offence in subsection (7) more precisely at somebody who is directly responsible for it. I believe that the feeling was that the existing provision is perhaps framed too widely. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provisions in Clause 58 are important. They ensure that where a professional fund-raiser or commercial participator is acting on behalf of a charity, every potential donor is given the information which he needs in order to make an informed decision about whether he should make a donation and, if so, how. I think it right therefore that these new duties on fund-raisers should be enforceable. I do not think anyone would disagree that a criminal offence is the right way to proceed.<br><br>
The amendment would limit the commission of an offence under this clause to those professional fund-raisers or commercial participators who are responsible for or privy to the default in question. It could be difficult to establish whether a particular fund-raiser is responsible for a default or indeed is privy to it. A default may have been caused by the actions of one or more of the fund-raiser's employees.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0501">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
The clause as drafted provides that, where the default in question is occasioned by an employee of a professional fund-raiser or a commercial participator, the fund-raiser or commercial participator has a defence. Subsection (8) provides that where the fund-raiser or commercial participator can show that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence, then he is not guilty of the offence. In this way the new provision will not punish fund-raisers where they have done all that they can to ensure that the law is complied with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that this amendment and the next one to a certain extent hang together. If the Committee were minded to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"responsible for or privy to such act or default",</p></blockquote>
in subsection (7), I agree that subsection (8) then becomes superfluous and can be removed.<br><br>
I am slightly concerned about the concept of vicarious criminal liability which this morning the noble Earl almost preferred, although not in those words. In other words, the commercial participator or the professional fund-raiser is to be responsible in criminal law and indeed subject to conviction and fine if somebody whom he may have employed, or indeed may be employing, does something of which he knows nothing and which is contrary to his instructions. It seems to me that in those circumstances he should not run the risk of being convicted of a criminal offence and that therefore the proposed amendment pinning it down specifically to somebody who is responsible for or privy to such act or default is indeed a sensible one. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendments Nos. 82B to 82D not moved.</i>]</p>
<p>Clause 58, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 59 [<i>Cancellation of payments made to professional fund-raisers etc.</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 83:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 51, line 44, after ("forthwith") insert ("less the cost of administering that repayment").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 85 and 87.<br><br>
When responding to Amendment No. 80A in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, my noble friend Lord Astor indicated that the Government accepted the principle behind these three amendments. As I see it, the wording is simple and effective. I can see no reason why they should be turned down. I would expect my noble friend to accept them as they stand. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that we consider Clause 59 to be an important new safeguard for the interests of the donors. However, we have no desire as a result of introducing these safeguards to impose unnecessary or inappropriate burdens on professional fund-raisers or commercial participants.<br><br>
I have found the arguments of my noble friend in support of these amendments to be persuasive and I am happy to accept the principle behind the amendments, but I understand that there are some small technical problems with the wording. I shall be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
happy to accept the amendments in principle, but would like to bring forward my own amendment at Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish of me not to accept my noble friend's reply. I look forward to reading his improved drafting of the amendment at Report stage. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 83A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 51, line 45, at end insert ("where the payment is in excess of £50 or other such amount as may be specified from time to time by the Secretary of State.").</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p>[<i>Amendment No. 85 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 85A:

<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 86 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 87 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved No. 87A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 52, line 26, at end insert ("where the payment is in excess of £50 or other such amount as may be specified from time to time by the Secretary of State.").</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 88 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p>On Question, Whether Clause 59, as amended, stand part of the Bill?</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say a word on Clause 59. Since Clause 59 is the end of a group of amendments with which the television appeals for charitable funds are concerned, I ask that at some time before we finally part with the Bill we should be told—it is desirable that we should know—just how the provisions of the Bill fit the biggest fund-raisers in the land; namely, those who appeal for money on television.<br><br>
Those appeals raise issues entirely distinct from nearly all other forms of charitable fund-raising. I believe also that they are appeals made with a good deal of unnecessary commercial glamour and a good deal of contrived giving. I believe that they are not always entitled to the support that they receive.<br><br>
As we are dealing with them incidentally, along with all other forms of charitable fund-raising, it is important to know just how this Bill will be fitted on to them. I do not suggest for a moment that we should stop now to try to do that, but eventually it is desirable to know what new regime is to be applied to television broadcasting for charitable appeals.</span></p>

<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said on an earlier amendments that we intend to bring forward amendments before Report stage on the two aspects of expenses on refunds and the number of days. Television appeals are increasingly popular and raise an increasingly large sum of money. It is extremely important that we get Clause 59 right.</span></p>
<p>Clause 59, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 60 [<i>Right of charitable institution to prevent unauthorised fund-raising</i>]:</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 89 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 89A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 53, line 13, leave out ("and") and insert ("or").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a simple drafting amendment. Perhaps the Committee will consider Clause 60(2). It refers back to subsection (1) (b) which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the court is also satisfied as to one or more of the matters specified in subsection (2).</p></blockquote>
Then three matters are set out. The word "and" is put after paragraph (b). I suggest that the word "or" would make the matter clearer. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my noble friend Lord Renton puts forward on the amendment in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. In their view the inclusion of the word "and" suggests that all three criteria have to be met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed they do not. The court may grant an injunction to a charitable institution to prevent authorised fund-raising on its behalf where it is satisfied as to any one or more of the matters listed in subsection (2). Those words appear in subsection (1) (b). It therefore makes absolutely clear that it is only one or more and not all three that have to be satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my noble friend therefore saying that the amendment should not be made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the correct interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not divide the Committee on it, but I feel bound to say that I am very surprised. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment Nos. 90 and 91 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 91A not moved.</i>]</p>
<p>Clause 60 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 61 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 62 [<i>Regulations about fund-raising.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 92:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 54, line 24, leave out paragraph (c) and insert:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>("(c) require professional its or commercial participators who are parties to such agreements with charities and other appropriate bodies, to remit the full amount of monies or other property directly solicited or represented by them in the execution of that agreement, to the charity or other appropriate body without deducting fees or expenses;").</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the appropriate control that charities and other appropriate bodies should have on the fundraising activities of third parties acting on their behalf. The amended wording would, I understand, follow exactly the Government's intention in this respect as identified in Paragraph 10.18 of the White Paper. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to speak briefly in favour of the amendment. I rejoice to hear the Government are apparently in favour of it. I hope to have a reassuring message from the noble Earl that what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, says is correct.<br><br>
It seems highly desirable that these moneys should be handed over gross and not after expenses, in particular, have been deducted. It is a very sensitive matter. It does not seem desirable, given the fact that we are now given all the arrangements applying to charities on a totally different statutory basis, to allow the law to be silent on this point.<br><br>
Obviously there could easily be a dispute about what is an appropriate level of expenses. In the view of the charity some fund-raisers might deduct an unreasonable level of expenses. That being so, it seems that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, is highly desirable and I hope that the Government will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the regulations which the Secretary of State may make. In the White Paper we said that we intended to introduce a requirement that professional fund-raisers and commercial participators who receive funds raised for or on behalf of a charity should remit the full amount to the charity without deducting fees or expenses. This amendment is designed to give clear effect to that proposal, which has been generally welcomed throughout the charity world.<br><br>
Although subsection (2) (c) is worded in general terms, the regulations which will be made under it will include the kind of requirement that I have just described. But the provision should not be limited to that requirement alone. I have already told the Committee that we intend to consult thoroughly during the preparation of regulations to be made under Clause 62. The amendment would allow no consultation; it would be merely a requirement. We would not want to rule out the possibility of such consultation prompting the Secretary of State to consider making regulations covering other aspects of the transmission of money from a fund-raiser to a charity.<br><br>
What my noble friend Lord Swinfen seeks by the amendment will be carried out in the regulations but only after we have had consultations with the charity world. It is better to take that action rather than have a strict and inflexible interpretation written on the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision is not a strict and inflexible interpretation because of the use of the word "may" in line 16. Subsection (2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), any such regulations may".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0503">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
That does not mean that they have to. The subsection does not require the Secretary of State to make those regulations but merely states that he may. No doubt he will decide whether he may or he may not after consultation. If after consultation he decides that he may make the regulations I do not see why paragraph (c) should not remain as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a most remarkable suggestion. My noble friend has moved an amendment, but if the noble Lord, Lord Richard, says that the Secretary of State may or may not decide, then there is not much point in having the amendment. I return to the fact that it is the intention of the Secretary of State to introduce it. I suggest that it is better introduced after consultation rather than as a bald statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the discussion but that is precisely the danger of this type of subsection. It begins by stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the generality of… any such regulations may",</p></blockquote>
and then goes on to give three examples. All we are saying is that this is a fourth example and ought to be in the subsection as indicating the way in which the Government's mind is moving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It means that the Secretary of State can make those provisions and not necessarily others. It may be desirable that the Secretary of State should make other provisions too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with the indication given by my noble friend Lord Ferrers. I hope that he will ensure that the regulations are drafted in words at least as strong as those in my amendment. I shall not prolong the debate and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>Clause 62 agreed to.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 93 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>
<p>Clause 63 [<i>Interpretation of Part III</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 93A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, line 5, leave out from ("(2))") to end of line 13 and insert ("a charitable appeal which is made—
<ol>
<li>in any public place, or</li>
<li>by means of visits from house to house;</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(aa) "charitable appeal" means an appeal to members of the public to give money or other property (whether for consideration or otherwise) which is made in association with a representation that the whole or any part of its proceeds is to be applied for charitable purposes; and").</p></blockquote>
The noble Earl said: During the debate on Second Reading a number of Members of the Committee expressed anxiety that the scope of the definition of "public place" in Clause 63 cast the net of regulation too wide. It was argued that the Bill would require charity shops to have a permit in order to be able to trade and that permits might also be necessary for coffee mornings in private houses. I undertook to consider the drafting of the Bill in order to ensure that inappropriate regulations such as this were not imposed by the Bill. These amendments reflect the results of that consideration.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
They are intended to ensure that the activities to be regulated under Part III of the Bill are no wider than those which we in fact intend. The amendments will ensure that the Bill will regulate collections that are taken in places which, although technically private, are for many purposes, including access by members of the public, no different to purely public places. I have in mind the forecourts of railway stations and privately-owned shopping centres. Such places can be lucrative sites for public collections. It appears to us to be right that the Bill should ensure that the promoters of collections in that type of place are subject to the same accountability as those who promote appeals in purely public places.<br><br>
The public in such areas will also be protected from the potential nuisance of many competing public collections by the requirement being imposed for a permit from a local authority. However, the owner of the property will have the last word in giving permission to collect on his private property.<br><br>
I know that the amendments will meet with the happy and welcome approval of the noble Lords, Lord Allen of Abbeydale and Lord Richard, because we have ensured that appeals such as coffee mornings in private homes or village halls would not be caught by the provision. The noble Lord, Lord Allen, was concerned about the effect on his wife should she decide to have a coffee morning. The sponsored slim in the office foyer of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will also be permissible. I am sure that will meet with great benefaction. It also rules out the possibility of a charity shop requiring a permit to trade. It seems unnecessary to catch any of these activities in Part III of the Bill and I hope that the amendments will meet with the approval of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in believing that the amendments cover collection boxes which are owned by charities and placed in shops?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That comes later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in believing that the amendments cover village fetes and carnivals held on common ground? There is still concern in the charity world that money raised at such events will remain subject to the regulations under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Richard, is too quick. I shall have to find out about that matter. Perhaps the noble Lord will look at page 55, line 17. It states that in relation to a charitable appeal a public place:
<br><blockquote><p>"means any highway and any other place to which, at any time when the appeal is made, members of the public have or are permitted to have access".</p></blockquote>
It also provides that it is either not within a building or, if it is, is a public area within an estate. I believe that such commons to which the noble Lord refers are public places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that Clause 63(1) defines public charitable collections. It would appear that a collecting box owned by a charity and placed in a shop would be covered by that. Perhaps I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0504">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
am being slow in the uptake, but I should be grateful if my noble friend could tell me where the relevant provision appears later in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are excluded under Clause 63(2) (b).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this set of amendments and advise my noble friend that in view of them I shall not move Amendment No. 97 and the other amendment grouped with it.</span></p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 94:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, line 14, leave out ("(except in section 70)").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 95, 102, 103, 104 and 107. Amendment No. 94 is a paving amendment for the later ones. They will enable charities not charitable in law to apply for exemption orders. The amendments seek to define the breadth of the term "other appropriate body". The argument against the present drafting is that disaster appeals, which are charitable trusts but not charities in law under the 1960 Act, would also be excluded under the current drafting. Therefore, there would have been no ability to hold an appeal after such events as the Lockerbie disaster or the Penlee lifeboat disaster that occurred a few years ago. This matter needs to be addressed. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my noble friend will be very careful about this matter. The Bill is intended to deal with the law of charity. Over the years the concept of charity has been carefully considered by the courts. There has never been a full statutory definition of it. We have to be careful not to be tendentious in the Bill and to stretch the concept of charity into kinds of giving about which the law does not need to be concerned. In the Bill as it stands—it is not the first time it appears—we find in Clause 63(1) (b) that "charitable purposes" means,
<br><blockquote><p>"any charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes".</p></blockquote>
That in itself extends charitable purposes a good deal. It needs to be considered in the light of the definition of "charitable purposes" on page 47 of the Bill:
<br><blockquote><p>'"charitable purposes' means any charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes, whether or not they are charitable within the meaning of any rule of law".</p></blockquote>
To my mind, with those words the Bill goes very far and stretches the application of the rules relating to charity into realms which have never been considered to be charitable and need not be considered to be charitable. I shall come back to this matter at Report stage. Meanwhile it seems to me that my noble friend Lord Swinfen wishes to stretch what I call the non-charitable concept still further. We must be very careful. We should stick to the main purpose of the Bill which is to bring the law of charity up to date rather than to stretch it into other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my noble friend sits down, he appears to have missed out from Clause 63(1) (b) the small piece in brackets "except in section 70", which deals with exemption certificates for national appeals.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
I am thinking of national appeals for disaster relief after an earthquake or typhoon—something that happens suddenly and unexpectedly—when there is not time to set up a proper charitable body. The nation as a whole is feeling charitable, wishes to help and needs a vehicle through which that help can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has a point here. With regard to what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, we had a discussion—it now seems a long time ago—about the definition of charitable purposes for the purposes of Part II and Part III. If the noble Lord's comment were pursued to its logical conclusion it would have a pretty devastating effect on Part II, the consideration of which we have just completed. On the particular point raised in this amendment, I never expected that I would rise to my feet on behalf of Greenpeace and Amnesty International.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that Greenpeace, which is not a registered charity, is concerned about the drafting. It would not be able to apply to the Charity Commission, which is taking over these new responsibilities, whereas Amnesty International, though not a registered charity is an exemption order holder, would not be able to go to the Charity Commission under the new arrangements. There is a point here that calls for some thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, would deal with the matters raised just now by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. I refer in particular to the question of Amnesty International, which for obvious reasons cannot be a charity. This organisation has done immensely important work for the victims of tyrannical regimes in many parts of the world. It would be wholly deplorable if it were put in a disadvantageous position as a result of the passage of the Bill. I very much hope that the noble Earl will be able to tell us that something can be done to deal with the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the reason which has prompted my noble friend Lord Swinfen to table this amendment. He is concerned that the Lockerbie appeal and the Penlee lifeboat appeal should be covered. In fact they are not charities, and they are not charities for very good reasons. Both the Lockerbie and Penlee appeals did not, to use the words of Clause 70(1) (a), pursue any charitable purpose,
<br><blockquote><p>"throughout the whole or a substantial part of England and Wales".</p></blockquote>
Disaster appeals of that kind are set up for particular individuals. They are not charitable because benefit can go to certain individuals irrespective of their need. A charitable appeal may only benefit a public class and may only benefit its beneficiaries to the extent of their need. In fact, very often when those public appeals are set up they prefer not to be charitable because, by not being charitable, they are able to be more specific. My noble friend Lord Renton was right when he said that the Bill deals only with charity.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
The power to grant orders under this Bill will be with the Charity Commissioners. They are responsible for the supervision of charities. They are not responsible for non-charitable benevolent and philanthropic institutions. It would be inappropriate for the commissioners to have responsibility for granting exemption orders to non-charitable bodies for which they have no responsibility. My noble friend was concerned about the definition of "charitable purposes" in Clause 63(1) (b). He need not be concerned—it is the same as that in the House to House Collections Act 1939.<br><br>
The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, referred to Amnesty International. It has two charitable arms, each of which may apply for an exemption order, so I think it ought to be covered. I hope that my noble friend Lord Swinfen will agree with me that it is only suitable for the Charity Commissioners to grant exemption orders for bodies over which they have responsibility and not for bodies over which they have none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the Charity Commissioners possibly should not have their powers widened. I appreciate also that both the Lockerbie disaster and the Penlee lifeboat disaster were inappropriate examples. However, what is the position with something like the Armenian earthquake disaster? It killed large numbers of people and rendered thousands homeless at the beginning of winter, with the consequent difficulty of obtaining food supplies. It was charitable relief and charitable work to help those people. Can the Minister say how an appeal of that sort can obtain exemption from the need to go to every single local authority in the country to obtain a collecting licence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, says. One can think of a whole range of examples—the Bangladesh situation and many others—where, as a result of appeals made immediately after those disasters, large sums of money were raised in this country which saved the lives of thousands of people.<br><br>
The question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, goes to the heart of the matter. The Government are changing the arrangements for perfectly understandable reasons. But there is an obligation upon them to say how organisations set up immediately after a major international tragedy can in the immediate aftermath appeal for and raise substantial sums of money. How does the noble Earl answer that question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this context we must not ignore the Revenue law implications. When the Prime Minister was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he proposed—and it was accepted—that the Finance Bill should provide that anyone who gave in any one year a sum not less than £800 and up to £1,500,000 to a registered charity should be allowed to deduct that sum from his gross income before income tax was assessed on it. That was a splendid provision and great use has been made of it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
If we are extending indirectly and by statute the concept of charity, one wonders whether the kinds of appeal about which we have heard will make the donors eligible to deduction of donations from income. I do not know whether the Government have considered that point, but it has implications. There are other implications. The bodies which organise the appeals have offices, and those offices can obtain exemption from rates if they are used by charities but not if they are not used by charities. I wonder what the implications of that kind of provision will be also if we extend to other kinds of giving the advantages which for a long time have been established in relation to charities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways we are becoming rather involved in the matter. Primarily we are talking of bodies which are charitable. It is those which will be permitted under Clause 70 to obtain exemption orders. As my noble friend Lord Renton rightly said at the beginning, if the Charity Commission gives exemption orders, they must be given to those bodies over which it has authority. It cannot give them to those over which it has no authority. Therefore, while I understand the anxiety Members of the Committee may feel about the Armenian or Bangladesh disasters, if those organisations are not charities it is impossible for the Charity Commission to cover them. However, whether or not they are charities, it should be possible for them to raise money via another body which is a charity. If that is so, then it is possible for them to be covered by exemption orders.<br><br>
Even were that not so, we are talking about an exemption order which permits people to gather money anywhere throughout the country without the need to go to each local authority. But the provision refers only to street collections or house-to-house collections. As I understand the position, if an organisation were set up called "The Armenian Disaster Relief" or "The Bangladesh Disaster Relief", both of which are worthy causes for which to raise money, there is no reason why donations cannot be made by giving money to banks or some other form of specified receiver. The provision merely grants an exemption order for street or house-to-house collections, which is fairly limited.<br><br>
In those cases, if the object for which the funds are being raised is not itself a charity, it is possible for the funds to be raised by a body which is a charity, in which case the exemption orders will apply.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can return to the point because it is a matter of considerable significance. Of course I understand that the Charity Commission exists in order to regulate charities. The arrangements set out in the Bill are appropriate for charities and difficulties would arise if non-charities were to be brought within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I accept that.<br><br>
However, the Government have an obligation to explain the full consequences of the changes because they are recommending an amendment of the law. At the moment there is no difficulty. At present the Home
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0506">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
Office agrees to the exemptions. The Government now come forward and say they want to change all that and give responsibility to the Charity Commission. The noble Earl says, "Well, given the fact that we are transferring responsibility to the Charity Commission, only charities can be covered".<br><br>
In my view the Government have a responsibility to explain what will happen to those other organisations. The Bangladesh or Armenian organisations collecting for those disasters do not have the time to go round hundreds of local authorities to obtain exemption. They want to raise money in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy which moves millions of people in this country.<br><br>
I do not ask the noble Earl to make a commitment on the matter today. That would be unreasonable. However, I hope that he will reflect on it between now and the next stage of the Bill. I repeat, at the moment the Home Office holds that responsibility; that responsibility is being transferred to the Charity Commission. I shall be grateful if the noble Earl will agree to consider the matter between now and Report stage to see whether something can be done to deal with the problem we have identified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can follow that. A difficulty exists which is caused by the structure of the Bill. This part of the Bill does not deal with charities; it deals with charitable collections. One then looks at what a charitable collection is and finds that it is a collection for a charity or for charitable purposes, which under Clause 63(1) (b) means,
<br><blockquote><p>"any charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes, whether or not they are charitable within the meaning of any rule of law".</p></blockquote>
We are talking of public charitable collections in the strict sense of a collection for a charity and public charitable collections in the sense of paragraph (b). The difficulty is that the Government have effectively erected a structure of licensing for both those types of collections—the charitable ones and, in shorthand, what I shall refer to as quasi-charitable ones—which unfortunately stops at the point where it becomes important; namely, when the quasi-charitable institution wants to launch a national appeal. It is not good enough for the noble Earl to say, "Oh, well, if the people who want to launch the appeal wrap it up in a certain way, they can become a charity as opposed to being a quasi-charity". Then they would become a charity covered by the Charity Commissioners under Section 70. Somehow this must be reconciled.<br><br>
If at the moment the power lies with the Home Office, I do not know the answer, but does the Bill take away that power from the Home Office? I see nods from people who are much more expert than I, so I understand that it does take away that power from the Home Office. I hesitate to suggest that the power should be given back to a ministry like the Home Office, but is that the way out of this conundrum? It seems to me to be a better way out, on the face of it, than getting the quasi-charity to pretend that it is really a charity and therefore it is covered by Section 70.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the last point is that it takes the power away from the Secretary of State and gives it to the Charity Commissioners. To that extent, it obviously limits the Secretary of State's powers. There is a problem here. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, was kind enough to say that he would not press the amendment and I am grateful. I shall certainly look at it between now and the next stage to see what, if anything, can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has taken that attitude. As we have been going through this short debate the feeling has been growing upon me in regard to these philanthropic exercises—I use that phrase so that I do not get muddled up with the legal definition of "charity"—that in response to natural disasters anywhere in the world the exercise can be carried out properly. After the Bill becomes law we may need to alter it in far more parts than this. Therefore, the whole matter needs to be properly examined and I am delighted that my noble friend has given that undertaking. I welcome it and beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 94.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 95 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendments Nos. 95ZA, 95ZB and 95ZC:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, leave out lines 17 to 20.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, line 21, leave out ("an") and insert ("a charitable").</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, line 22, leave out ("or in a place of public worship").</p></blockquote>
The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 95ZA was spoken to with Amendment No. 93A. I beg to move Amendments Nos. 95ZA, 95ZB and 95ZC.</span></p>
<p>On Question, amendments agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 95A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, line 23, after ("worship") insert ("or in or on any churchyard annexed or belonging to or any land within the curtilage of a place of public worship").</p></blockquote>
The right reverend Prelate said: Is it possible for me to ask a question about Amendment No. 96E? Can we be assured by the noble Lord that whereas the assurance has been given that Amendment No. 95ZC removes the exemption for places of worship, such places will fall outside the new definition of "public place" in Amendment No. 96E? It is a matter of definition.<br><br>
Amendment No. 95A which I move in the name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury, is modest. It will help churches and other denominations in fund-raising. I hope that it will be of benefit to all churches. It asks that collections in churchyards and in the curtilage of other places of worship shall be exempt from the need for a local authority permit under Part II of the Bill. The amendment was tabled by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury before the welcome amendment in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, which would change the face of Part III. It is still needed, despite that amendment, because parishioners have certain rights of access to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0507">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
the churchyard of their parish church and the public may be admitted and have access to the curtilage of other churches.<br><br>
As originally drafted, the Bill accepted that there should be no need for a local authority permit in the case of collections in a place of public worship, on the basis that church authorities could be relied upon to supervise the collection and because it would affect members of the public only if they wished to be involved.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Government do not seek to withdraw from that. On the contrary, they wish to extend the exclusion from local authority control to virtually all buildings where similar considerations apply. I hope that the Committee will agree that they should apply equally to churchyards and other land around places of worship.<br><br>
I will not delay the Committee with too many examples of what might be done. However, one example is where the rector or vicar sits outside the church and receives donations from his parishioners on the annual gift day. Another might be sponsored peals on the bells to raise money. I urge the Committee to realise that this is the kind of activity which can safely be left to the church concerned. Requiring a permit from the local authority serves no useful purpose in practice. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to support the amendment if there could be explained to me and other Members of the Committee the significance of the words "in or on". What appeal could take place in a churchyard which was not on it? What appeal could take place on a churchyard which was not in it? Can an appeal take place slightly above the surface of the churchyard? I quite understand that no appeal could take place slightly below it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I went up in a hot air balloon last Saturday. That would have been a fund-raising activity above the churchyard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been neither in nor on the churchyard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to leave this to the draftsmen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, if the hot air balloon landed in an open grave, it would have been in the churchyard!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should then be able to attract the kind of philanthropic appeal of which the noble Earl spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is becoming a peculiarly interesting debate. All I say to the right reverend Prelate is that because of the amendments which we have passed a church will not now be included because a church is a building. It will therefore automatically fall outside that part of the clause.<br><br>
I see that there is a problem about churchyards. We have hassled over this for quite a while and I recognise that there is a difficulty which I should like to consider between now and the next stage.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case I am perfectly happy to leave it to the noble Earl and shall withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 96:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 55, line 23, leave out from ("worship") to end of line 27.</p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord said: The object of this amendment is to regulate unattended collection boxes. Clause 63 and the other clauses in Part III require a permit for a public charitable collection, while Clause 63(2) specifically exempts a public charitable collection which is made by placing unattended collecting boxes in public places. By definition, a collecting box is unattended if it is merely placed in a shop, restaurant, hotel, public house or garage forecourt or the like.<br><br>
At Second Reading I reminded your Lordships of the true story of the man who distributed 1,000 unattended collecting boxes all round the place. Not a single penny was ever devoted to any charitable purpose. That kind of bogus collecting is left entirely uncontrolled by the Bill.<br><br>
I questioned the Minister at Second Reading as to the reason for exempting unattended collecting boxes. The answer was that the amount of money collected by these means is usually relatively small. Such collections do not have the potential to cause inconvenience to the public, as is the case with other types of collection.<br><br>
Unattended collecting boxes require a permit as the law now stands under the House to House Collections Act of 1939. However, that Act is to be repealed by Clause 76 of the Bill. So in that respect the Bill is relaxing and not strengthening the existing law. That is contrary to the purpose of the Bill, which is to suppress abuse.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the noble Earl could expand a little on the reasons why he considers that the existing law should be relaxed in this respect. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be somewhat concerned if the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord were to be accepted. I have already expressed my anxiety about the collecting box placed in a shop owned by a charity. In reply to my question, my noble friend referred to the subsection which the noble and learned Lord's amendment would leave out of the Bill.<br><br>
I am still not absolutely clear when a collecting box is attended and when it is unattended. That needs to be made clear. As I understand it, as the Bill stands at present -I should be grateful if my noble friend would confirm it - a collecting box in a shop owned by a charity is free and does not need a licence. I hope that that is and will remain the case after the noble and learned Lord's amendment has been disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps I may say that the amendment is not confined
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0508">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
to unattended collecting boxes in a charity shop. It deals with unattended collecting boxes which are in hotels, restaurants, shops etc.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble and learned Lord says that the amendment is not confined to collecting boxes in a shop owned by a charity. Does he mean to say that it does not cover collecting boxes which are in a shop owned by a charity? Does he mean that the amendment does not cover that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I agree that that would be covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot support the noble and learned Lord's amendment. It would make life extremely difficult for many charities. As the amendment is worded, it would also cover receptacles handed out by charities in the form of house-to-house collections. They are put through the letter-boxes of houses and left unattended in the hope that the occupier of the house will put a donation in them to be collected at some future date.<br><br>
This measure would also do away with awareness raising by charities of the name and work of the charity. Quite often the value of a charitable collecting box in a shop, garage or elsewhere lies in the fact that the name of that specific charity is put before the public who then, when they receive a more direct appeal, say, "Oh yes, I know that charity", and give a donation. With respect, I do not feel that the amendment ought to be supported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can help the Committee with this. It is a matter which has caused some concern. I should explain that we do not intend that a permit should be required for the type of collection where a charity leaves a collecting box in a place such as a pub, restaurant or shop. Clause 63 reflects that.<br><br>
If my noble friend Lord Peyton will look at Clause 63(2), line 26, he will see that:
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of paragraph (b) above a receptacle is unattended if it is not in the possession or custody of a person acting as a collector".</p></blockquote>
Therefore the type of case where a tin is put down on the counter of a bar would not be covered by this clause. Indeed, it is not our intention that it should be. I do not believe that it is caught at present under the 1939 Act.<br><br>
The system of permits is designed to apply to collections which take place in public houses or from house to house over limited and usually short periods of time. It is not suitable for static collection boxes, which tend to be in place for rather long periods and which are much less intrusive to the public.<br><br>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, referred to the case that he mentioned at Second Reading. He was concerned about collecting boxes which were abandoned by the charity or at least which are not collected regularly. The Charity Commissioners have in fact had some successes recently in tackling this problem. I understand that it is common for the landlord of a public house or the manager of a shop where a collecting box has been placed to contact the commissioners if it has been left
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
there for an unduly long time. With their powers of inquiry and powers to act for the protection of charity property in the 1960 Act, the commissioners are able to transfer funds which are contained in boxes that have been abandoned to the official custodian for safekeeping during the conduct of an inquiry into the charity's affairs.<br><br>
Charities still need advice and guidance on good practice in this area and the commissioners are examining what can be done to reinforce that. Given that the commissioners can and do act in the way that I have described and that unattended receptacles on the whole cause little or no public inconvenience, I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, on reflection will feel that his amendment is not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have aired the point. I shall not press it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

I have a feel that their amendment does exactly the same as mine intends to do, but rather more simply.<br><br>
The clause as drafted is rather too heavy handed. It is not the intention of the Government, I am sure, to criminalise a volunteer who is acting as a collector where the charity ought to have obtained a licence and has failed to do so. It is quite obviously their intention to make it a criminal offence for a person to collect ostensibly for a charity without that charity's knowledge or consent. That is a matter with which I entirely agree. However, I hope that the Government can see their way to accepting Amendment No. 98A if my Amendment No. 98 is not acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Alport)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to advise the Committee that if this amendment is agreed to I cannot call Amendment No. 98A.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The offence in Clause 64 bites on promoters of unauthorised public charitable collections and collectors in such unauthorised collections for good reason. As drafted, the offence will catch promoters and collectors when they act in collusion. It is not uncommon where a fraudulent collection is undertaken for the promoters of it, and the collectors undertaking it, to be acting in concert and with the same intent to defraud the donors. If the offence were only to bite on promoters we would be creating a significant loophole for fraudulent collectors. It is already an offence for a person to act as a collector in an unauthorised collection under Section 1(3) of the House to House Collections Act 1939.<br><br>
My noble friend Lord Swinfen is worried about the possibility of collectors who believe a collection is authorised being prosecuted for a genuine mistake. That seems to me not terribly likely. However, I understand the anxieties he has expressed. Therefore, I am prepared to consider whether an element of knowledge should not be introduced into Clause 64(2) (b), which I believe would solve any anxieties that he has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Mottistone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite certain whether my noble friend indicates that he will go far enough. There ought to be not just knowledge but some offence if the matter is a simple one. If people have to obtain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
permission from the local authority for doing what, over years, they have been doing perfectly simply without having to obtain such permission, many will make mistakes which they know they are making because they do not believe the law.<br><br>
It is an important area. People have been raising funds for years, in particular in rural areas. They will not believe the Bill if it insists that they have to go to the local authority for permission in all cases. People may well know that they are not asking for permission without realising that it is against the law and that this penalty hangs over them.<br><br>
I hope my noble friend will go a good deal further to modify this subsection either along the lines of the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, or perhaps more fully. Perhaps my noble friend will be a little more encouraging than he has been.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been an offence for 50 years under the House to House Collections Act 1939. However, I said that I shall consider whether an element of knowledge can be introduced into the Bill. That will cover the genuine worries that he has raised. It covers the case where the collector was suffering a genuine mistake because he or she thought the collection was authorised. Therefore, I believe that what we wish to consider will cover the concerns raised by the noble Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my noble friend and his advisers will give this matter serious consideration between now and Report stage. I have no intention of pressing my amendment now because I believe that the following amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is simpler and deals with the matter, as the noble Viscount said. It covers the element of dishonesty that he brought into his response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

The noble Lord said: I move the amendment on behalf of my noble friend Lord Richard. I hope that it is helpful. It supports what has already been said by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen.<br><br>
Clause 64(2)(b) creates a criminal offence. We have heard from the noble Viscount that he is minded to introduce the idea of knowledge of the action as part of this subsection. The word "dishonestly" as we debated it—was it yesterday? It seems so long ago—would be helpful in making that distinction. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are those of us who believe that the Bill as it stands is all right. In undertaking to consider whether it is possible to put in an ingredient of knowledge between now and Report stage, my noble friend has gone every bit as far as anyone can reasonably ask. I hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendment. I shall certainly oppose it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Peyton for his support. I believe it would not be of any benefit to the Committee for the noble Lord, Lord Morris, and myself to have a discussion about the meaning of the word "dishonestly". We would probably get into almost as big a muddle as we did yesterday. However, I said to my noble friend Lord Swinfen that we shall consider the very point that the noble Lord, Lord Morris, made in considering the clause. I hope that he will accept that explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. We are concerned that it is very easy in many cases for a crooked promoter to dupe collectors. At this level of criminalisation volunteers will be discouraged. They will vote with their feet. It is demotivating (if such a word exists) to the volunteers whom we are seeking to encourage.<br><br>
However, I accept the assurances given by the noble Viscount. With those assurances in mind, and reserving the right to come back, if necessary, at a later stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>Clause 64 agreed to:</p>
<p>Clause 65 [<i>Applications for permits to conduct public charitable collections</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 99:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 56, line 44, leave out ("three") and insert ("six").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: As the Bill is drafted, a charity which wishes to obtain a permit for a public charitable collection must make application at least one month and not more than three months before the relevant date. I am sure that the Committee would expect businesses to plan their work at least more than three months ahead. I know that in Parliament we plan only about three weeks in advance but that is because we deal with an ever changing situation and have to be prepared for anything. Businesses plan their work well in advance. My amendment is an attempt to help charities plan their work of fund-raising in advance.<br><br>
I have put forward what I consider to be an extremely modest suggestion of extending the time from three to six months. I work for a charity. Last October I applied for a licence for a public collection in September next year. In some ways I would be happier to see a year in advance. Any charity whose fund-raisers are worth their salt will be planning their campaigns well in advance. They must do so to ensure that they run effectively. The period of three months as appears in the Bill is ridiculously short. One must know that one has a licence before one can recruit collectors. One needs time to recruit the right type of collector to know that the job is being done properly. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously a balance must be kept between allowing charities to plan fund-raising activities effectively and ensuring that a few charities do not apply for all the permits so far in advance that they eat up the possibilities of other charities applying. My noble friend said that this was a modest amendment, but he is modest in saying so. It is a good amendment and I am happy to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that news.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 99A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 57, line 5, leave out from ("area") to end of line 6.</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: On behalf of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, I beg to move Amendment No. 99A. In relation to a local authority it leaves out the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"and may make such other inquiries as they think fit".</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with applications for permits to conduct public charitable collections. Clause 65(4) properly states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before determining any application … a local authority shall consult the chief officer of police for the police area which comprises or includes their area and may make such other inquiries as they think fit".</p></blockquote>
Nothing can stop them from making other inquiries. If those words are to be written into this Bill they should have been written in to many other Bills too. I do not wish to deprive the Government of suggesting that local authorities should make other inquiries if necessary. However, I suggest that it would be better if we left out the word "may". The amendment does not state that but that is my suggestion. We leave local authorities with the suggestion of making other inquiries but it is not sensible to write into the Bill provision for something that we cannot stop them doing anyway. I hesitate to say that it is typical of the overzealous, well-meaning, detailed drafting which increasingly clutters up the statute book. It is quite unnecessary. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had hope that it would be useful to have that provision spelt out in the Bill. Members of the Committee may believe that it is implicit, given the other provisions of Part II. After all, Clause 66(2) allows a local authority to attach conditions to any permit it issues. For example, it may specify the day or days of the week or the frequency with which collections may be made. Clause 67 allows a local authority to refuse to grant a permit on any of the grounds listed in that clause. Inevitably, therefore, local authorities will make inquiries before taking a decision on an application.<br><br>
We thought it sensible to include the provision in order to make the matter clear to those who read the Bill and, to use an awful phrase, to make it user friendly. We considered important to spell that out in the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced. It is not the kind of issue upon which I wish to divide the Committee but on Report I shall move to leave out the word "may". I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>Clause 65, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 66 [<i>Determination of applications and issue of permits</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 99B:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 57, line 33, leave out ("69(1) or (as the case may be) section 69(2)") and insert ("69").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The words which the noble and learned Lord proposes to leave out are entirely unnecessary. I beg to move.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are having a great deal of difficulty in satisfying my noble friend today. We are trying to be helpful. Where a local authority refuses to issue a permit for a public charitable function the applicant has a right of appeal. He can appeal under Clause 69(1) or, alternatively, where a local authority attaches conditions to a permit or varies them the applicant has a right of appeal under Clause 69(2). There is a right of appeal on two totally separate issues.<br><br>
The wording of Clause 66(4) makes it clear that the right of appeal under Clause 69(1) is to be distinguished from the right of appeal under subsection (2). They are exercisable in different circumstances and we thought that the drafting was helpful in revealing that fact. Under the wording in the Bill, in the notice the applicant would have to be pointed by the local authority to the precise subsection where his right of appeal is to be found, whether subsection (1) or (2). If my noble friend's amendment were passed it would simply require a reference to the clause without the applicant having it pointed out to him which section he could appeal under.<br><br>
This was our modest attempt to be helpful. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Renton will realise that we have been helpful and the intention of the provision is desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend is trying to be helpful but it is more helpful to leave out of legislation words that are not strictly necessary. I have made my point and done my best. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>Clause 66 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 67 [<i>Refusals to issue permits</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 100:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 58, line 4, leave out paragraph (c).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment and I speak to it in conjunction with Amendment No. 101 which is also probing. The two subsections give power to local authorities to refuse an application for a licence to collect on the grounds that the likely proceeds which will go to the charity or for charitable purposes will not be sufficient to warrant the granting of a licence. On what basis will that judgment be made? If it is to be by virtue of some standard notion of cost-proceeds ratio how will that be determined and by whom? Will it be different for different sizes of operation? Will it be borne in mind whether a charity is using the purposes of collection not solely to raise money but to raise awareness of its work?<br><br>
The fact that charities can willy-nilly, as it seems, be refused a licence gives me concern. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my noble friend is aware, local authorities may apply both of these tests when considering applications for licences to conduct house to house collections made under Section 2(3) (a) and (b) of the House to House Collections Act 1939. They have been doing so for 50 years and it has not, so far as I am aware, given rise to any problems. It seems right that local authorities should continue to have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
discretion to refuse to grant permits on either of the two grounds: that they perhaps have doubts about the size of the proceeds which will reach the charity concerned and where they are concerned about excessive remuneration claimed by any person involved in the collection. It enables local authorities to use their knowledge derived from past experience and local circumstances.<br><br>
That is preferable to attempting to lay down from the centre acceptable levels of remuneration, and so on, from this type of collection. Collections vary greatly in their sophistication and extent. The costs of the collection and the remuneration of persons involved in it may vary as a result. Wide consultation will be held with local authorities. We do not see that there will be a large problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my noble friend also consult charities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend. I said that the amendment was a probing amendment. I shall not of course press it, but I may come back to this matter at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 101 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 101ZA:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 58, line 41, leave out ("(whether on payment or otherwise)").</p></blockquote>
The noble Earl said: This amendment was spoken to with Amendment No. 93A. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 67, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p>Clauses 68 and 69 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 70 [<i>Orders made by Charity Commissioners</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount St. Davids</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 101A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 61, line 21, after first ("charity") insert ("or class of charities").</p></blockquote>
The noble Viscount said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 102A and 103A. A number of national organisations which are charities carry out their charitable enterprise through local entities which are also charities. What I seek to do with these three amendments is to empower the Charity Commissioners to respond to a single application by a parent charity on behalf of the local entities and thus cut down on a great deal of administration. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I understand my noble friend has in mind is to enable the commissioners to grant an order to headquarters organisations of charities which have many local branches. I do not think anything in the Bill prevents the national headquarters of an organisation—for example, the Boy Scouts—from obtaining an exemption order in order to enable its branches to undertake public collections on a particular day for the benefit of the headquarters. The only qualification would be that all the proceeds from the individual collections were intended for the purposes which the charity pursues - in the case I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
suggested that would be the Boy Scouts. Any money collected would be channelled to the headquarters organisation. The commissioners would treat such requests on their merits.<br><br>
However, I do not think it would be right to allow a national organisation to obtain an exemption order in order to allow its branches to undertake collections where they were not for the purposes of the charity and which might be for many different local purposes. That would undermine the system of local regulation in Part III of the Bill. But I think my noble friend's main concern would not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount St. Davids</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my noble friend's reply. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendments Nos. 102 to 104 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 105:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 61, line 35, at end insert (",subject to consultation with existing organisations in receipt of an order and other appropriate bodies prior to their initial publication and before any subsequent amendment;").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The current provision that enables the commissioners to impose any conditions that they think fit is too broad. This amendment will not remove the power but it will ensure that proper consultation takes place before any initial conditions are established and before any amendments to those conditions are made. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I were to explain a little more what is intended. The commissioners will look at each charity's application for an exemption order on its merits and either make the order or refuse the application. If the commissioners make the order then they will have power to include in it various conditions. Some of those conditions may well be of general application and will be inserted in each exemption order made. I am thinking particularly of conditions which would require the charity concerned to notify each local authority in whose area it proposed to collect of its intention to do so and to consider any representations made to the charity by the local authorities concerned following its notification. Other conditions which may be attached may only be relevant to the charity in question.<br><br>
I think it would be inappropriate and impracticable for the commissioners to be required to consult each existing exemption order holder before deciding whether or not to make another order—one under Clause 70—and attach conditions to it. Clause 70 gives the commissioners a new power in relation to charities and they will no doubt wish to consult widely and to take account of representations which may be made to them by the charities and others about its exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall read carefully what my noble friend said. I reserve my right to come back to the matter at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 106:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 61, line 38, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
<br><blockquote><p>("but where an order is revoked, the Commissioners shall provide written notice of their intention to do so to the organisation together with the reasons for their decision;
<ul>
<li>(d) A charity or other appropriate body whose order has been revoked by the Commissioners may appeal to the Secretary of State against a decision to revoke that order; and the Secretary of State may amend such a decision under regulations made under section 71.").</li></ul></p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I think it is wrong that the commission should be provided with sweeping powers to revoke an order without the need to consult and without any opportunity for appeal to a higher body. This amendment would provide the charity which is having its order revoked with the reasons for that revocation and also with the right to appeal if it did not think that those reasons were satisfactory. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the first part of the amendment. It seems only right that the commissioners should give their reasons for revoking an exemption order when they decide to do so. I should certainly like to look into the matter.<br><br>
I am not so sure, however, that it would be right to require the commissioners to give written notice of their intention to revoke an order. If the commissioners wish to revoke an exemption order because they suspect that the charity holding it of malpractice or abuse, it would not seem sensible to give the charity advance warning of the commissioners' intention.<br><br>
Of course, most orders will be revoked for purely run of the mill reasons, such as where the charity concerned is no longer undertaking the collections for which the order was granted. In those circumstances the commissioners would, as a matter of course, give the charity concerned notice of their intention to revoke the order.<br><br>
With regard to the question of an appeal against a decision by the commissioners to revoke an order, I do not think that such a provision is necessary. Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioners to revoke an exemption order, or indeed not to grant one in the first place, and who thinks the commissioners have acted unreasonably may seek judicial review of their decision.<br><br>
It would be inappropriate for there to be an avenue of appeal to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is not a higher body than the commissioners. The commissioners are not responsible to the Secretary of State for any aspect of their day-to-day administration and to make them responsible for this one aspect would not be right. The correct answer is to have judicial review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the noble Earl. I do not like the idea of some form of written notice being given of an intention to take action. If impropriety is suspected it will be an ill-judged requirement of the statute. That is my first point.<br><br>
My second point is that if reasons are to be given by the commission, in fact an organisation can go to the court by way of an application for judicial review, which meets the point entirely.</span></p>

The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 108 is designed to make sure that the Secretary of State takes steps to ensure proper consultation takes place before the regulations are produced. I realise that it will need better drafting and I shall not press it at this stage. However, I hope that my noble friend will give an undertaking that prior consultation will take place. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my noble friend's anxiety that the Government should consult widely when drawing up regulations after the Bill becomes law. I readily say again that we want to ensure that the regulations under Clause 71 and other clauses in the Bill are absolutely right. We shall need to consult widely to achieve that end and I am willing to undertake to the Committee that we will consult not only charities but also other appropriate bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when my noble friend considers the matter further he will refrain from mentioning specific charities, however important. There are a large number of well-known charities and to single out one or two would be wrong. I agree that it could be said that the NCVO and the ICFM are composite and representative bodies but, nevertheless, in the field of mental health and handicap more than one umbrella organisation exists. It could lead to great confusion to go into detail of that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my noble friend Lord Renton. He will recall that the Committee stage of the Bill was brought forward and amendments were therefore tabled in a hurry without a chance of their being corrected even to my standard of bad drafting.

<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 109 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 109A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 62, line 8, at end insert ("or in appropriate cases a return to the local authority stating the proceeds of the collection").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: When moving Amendment No. 109A I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 110 and 110A. Amendments Nos. 109 and 110A were tabled at the request of the Association of District Councils. Amendment No. 109A is designed to distinguish between the way in which accounts are presented, depending on the size and nature of a public charitable collection.<br><br>
The White Paper, <i>Charities: A Framework for the Future,</i> published in 1989, set out the intention that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
small local collections should be subject to less onerous conditions. District councils would not wish to impose an undue burden on small bodies organising local collections but they need to know the amount collected in order properly to consider their responsibilities under Clause 67(1). It will be helpful to receive an assurance that the regulations will allow for that. It is suggested that the proceeds of such a small local collection should not exceed £2,000.<br><br>
Amendment No. 110A introduces a minimum age for collections as opposed to leaving it to be determined by regulations. I understand that following the publication of the White Paper, discussion took place about whether a common minimum age should be introduced for house-to-house and street collections. The Home Office proposed a distinction being maintained, and that the age should be 16 and 14 respectively. However, as the Bill no longer draws a distinction between house-to-house and street collections, it is unlikely that there will be two age limits in the regulations. Given the specific dangers to young people collecting from houses, assurances are sought that the minimum age for collectors will be 16. That is the reason the amendment was tabled.<br><br>
Another relevant factor is that under Clause 72 the Bill proposes that collectors will be guilty of certain offences if they do not conduct the collection in the prescribed way. Again, the purpose of the amendment is to suggest that, given that responsibility, a collector should be 16 or over. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it stands, Clause 71(2) sets out specific matters relating to public collections which may be covered in regulations. It is not exclusive. Regulations may cover other matters as well.<br><br>
Perhaps I can deal with the three specific amendments mentioned. Amendment No. 109A allows regulations to provide for a return to be made to the local authority stating the proceeds of the collection as an alternative to keeping the publication of accounts in certain cases. Existing law requires a return to the local authority and it is desirable that that continues. It is not acceptable for such a statement to be an alternative to proper accounts.<br><br>
I now come to Amendment No. 110.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may interrupt. I do not know why Amendment No. 110 is grouped with the others. It raises quite a different point. The Minister will perhaps wait until the arguments have been advanced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case perhaps the noble Lord will speak to Amendment No. 110.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is different to the two amendments spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. The amendments were grouped in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it would help the Minister if he dealt with each amendment in turn. To be quite honest, when I saw the groupings I did not understand why all three were grouped together. It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
difficult to get the groupings right every time. We know that. That is the reason why, no matter how they are grouped, we are allowed to speak to each individually. I would be happy for the Minister to confine himself to Amendment No. 110A. I would not speak again to my second amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have spoken to Amendment No. 109A. Perhaps at this stage I can speak to Amendment No. 110A, the second of my noble friend's amendments, to which he spoke. Amendment No. 110A deals with the minimum age of collectors. I know that there has been anxiety about the dangers to which children may be exposed when collecting in public or door-to-door. That is why the power exists to set the minimum age. Before we decide what that age should be, we wish to consult interested parties, including charities and local authorities. We think it best not to specify the age in the Bill but to take further advice and let the age be capable of amendment if the spirit shows that to be desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that when an age is set it will be one age? We shall not have the differentiation which exists at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the noble Viscount consult the education and welfare officers of schools, because there are rules about the sale of newspapers? I believe the age ought to be the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this will not prevent boys from carrying out their traditional functions and asking for a penny for the guy. That is a longstanding activity. It is sometimes done in order to raise funds for a charity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may briefly answer my noble friend Lord Renton. Sometimes it may be for a charity but I suspect that more often it is to encourage the trade in the local sweetshop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, pocket money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question raised by my noble friend Lady Faithfull, we shall consult interested parties and the point she raised will be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend for his response. I feel more strongly on Amendment No. 110A than on Amendment No. 109A. It is essential that a proper minimum age for collectors be set in the interests of the safety of young collectors, apart from anything else. I shall consult those who advise me and may come back on these amendments at a later stage. In the meantime I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 109A.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 110:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 62, line 13, at end insert ("or combined badge and certificate").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I am sorry that I interrupted the noble Viscount earlier but this amendment has nothing to do with the two amendments to which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, was speaking. This amendment is of great importance to the Spastics Society, which has made representations to me. They employ about 300,000 collectors in the course of a year and considerable practical questions arise.<br><br>
At the moment, as I understand it, under the present regulations a collector has to wear a badge and carry with him certification that can be produced on demand. This seems to the society to create an opportunity for abuse, if there is nothing to identify a person wearing a badge or to suggest that he is a genuine collector.<br><br>
The Spastics Society wishes to make sure that the regulations are wide enough to make it possible to have a combined badge and certificate which would show the collector's name and address, the precise collecting area and specific dates of the collection and the expiry date. The society suggests, and I believe it is right, that that would reduce the possibilities of abuse and also save a good deal in the way of postage and administrative charges in recovering these expenses when they are incurred. The question is whether the regulations would be wide enough to cover such an arrangement. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support everything the noble Lord said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the clause stands at present it would not preclude the regulations from permitting a combined badge to be used where this was appropriate and could be justified. I believe that the combined badge may be desirable but is not necessary in all the circumstances. That is the important point. We wish to allow a certain flexibility so that the Secretary of State may, under the whole of this clause, be able to consult widely on the subject. We do not wish to make the provision so specific that it would cut down the scope of the regulations that the Secretary of State may make by order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what that means in respect of my amendment. Amendment No. 110 does not intend to make this the sole way of proceeding; it merely makes clear that this is one of the possibilities. I am not sure whether the Minister accepts it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that we feel that it is already clear and that the regulations will permit a combined badge to be used where appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I accept that clarity is to be found in the drafting of the clause. If we can have it on record that that is the view which the Home Office takes, and that under the regulations it would be possible for this to be done, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 110A not moved.</i>]</p>
<p>On Question, Whether Clause 71 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few words on Clause 71. It is an important clause and the Minister will understand that one of the problems faced by many thousands of bodies who undertake collections is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
the detail and precise requirements will be contained in regulations that will not be available until well after the Bill has been made law. We are grateful that the Government have clearly said that they propose to consult a large number of charitable organisations on the regulations.<br><br>
Can the Minister give the Committee an indication as to when that is likely to happen? Is there a target date for when the regulations will be published? One would not wish charities to be left in limbo for too long. I know that it is difficult and I understand all the bureaucratic problems that arise in giving any precise date at this stage. However, some indication of when it is likely to be made public would be helpful to charities and to this side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is aware, in talking to various amendments that relate to Clause 71 I have said that we will take representations from many different and differing bodies. I am afraid I can only say that it will be as soon as possible. Obviously it is an advantage for us to do it as soon as possible, but we must consult all the parties involved.</span></p>
<p>Clause 71 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 72 [<i>Offences in connection with the conduct of a collection</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 110B:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 62, line 25, leave out from ("any") to ("he") in line 27 and insert ("charitable appeal,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Earl said: This amendment was spoken to with Amendment No. 93A. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Amendment No. 111.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My Lord Chairman, if my noble friend Lord Swinfen will allow me to intervene, I suggest that the Marshalled List has put Amendments Nos. 111 and 111A in the wrong order. It may be that if Amendment No. 111A were to be accepted the amendment of my noble friends Lord Swinfen and Lord Mottistone would not wish to leave out subsection (3). Therefore, should we not consider Amendment No. 111A first?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised, and shall advise the Committee later, that if Amendment No. 111 is agreed to I shall not be able to call Amendment No. 111A.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that that is a further reason for taking Amendment No. 111A first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have called Amendment No. 111.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 111:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 62, line 39, leave out subsection (3).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I move Amendment No. 111 despite the protestations of my noble friend Lord Renton, whom I hope will not object too violently.<br><br>
I feel that this clause is too heavy-handed. A collector may be taken to be a potential criminal and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
required to give his name and address and to sign his name. It should be borne in mind that under the previous clause he should already have on him a badge which will be viewable and a collector's certificate to say who he is together with the place and time that he is licensed to collect. I feel that it would be quite reasonable for a constable to ask to see it to ensure that the collector is acting lawfully.<br><br>
Someone may have a certificate and badge licensing him to collect in the marketplace on Wednesday afternoon and only upon that Wednesday afternoon. If he is found collecting on Saturday as well, he is breaking the law.<br><br>
I feel that this subsection is totally unnecessary. Incidentally, it also takes no account of collectors who are not able to sign their name. It is not unusual for physically disabled people, particularly when they are collecting for charities for disabled people, to be out with collecting boxes which are sometimes balanced in their lap and sometimes held in their feet. But they may not be able to sign their name. Even if they are physically incapable of signing their name, I should think as a layman that they are breaking the law by being a collector.<br><br>
I should have thought that it might be unreasonable for someone not to show his badge and certificate to a constable when required. However, it is not reasonable to require that volunteers should automatically have to sign and given their name and address to a constable when collecting. There are thousands of people who collect for, say, the Poppy Day appeal who would be put off by such a requirement. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the amendment. I have dealt with many friends who are delinquents and who have gone to an organisation or charity and offered themselves as a volunteer. I have watched one such person go collecting. If the police know of someone like that and inadvertently the charity has taken him on as a collector, it is quite right that the police should be able to speak to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say briefly that I have some sympathy with this amendment and in particular with the point about signing the name. In my experience that could cause practical problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concern of my noble friend Lord Swinfen. This provision may appear to be heavy handed, but I hope to be able to reassure him that it is not. It will not affect the numbers of people who volunteer to collect for charities.<br><br>
Clause 72(3) simply retains the existing offence in the House to House Collections Act 1939. So far as I am aware, that offence has never given rise to any problems. It seems to me to impose quite reasonable requirements on those collecting for charitable purposes. At the very least it provides the means for the police to deter or detect public charitable collections undertaken without the necessary authority. The signature that the constable will be able to require may be compared with the signature that the collector will be obliged by the regulations to subscribe on the certificate.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
I understand the point about disabled people. But there is already a signature on the badge. This will enable the police, who may see someone collecting who may not be displaying a badge to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may just interrupt my noble friend for a moment. He said that he understood my point about disabled people, but he then went on to say that the disabled collector would already have a signature on the back of the certificate. A lot of disabled people are physically unable to write. Therefore their signature will not appear. But they may still be capable of taking a collection. That is a point that needs to be covered. They do not necessarily need someone with them as a chair-pusher or whatever at the time when they take the collection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord makes an important point. I should be happy to go away and consider the point about the signature. I was trying to say that there was a signature on the badge anyway which would help the police. The important point about the clause is that it will enable the police to be able to deal with someone who may be collecting but who may not be displaying a badge or who may be displaying a badge which is not obvious for everybody to see. I quite appreciate the point about the signature and I shall be happy to take the matter away and consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may make the point that the reason that the House to House Collections Act has never caused any problems is that it has never been enforced. Therefore there have been almost no prosecutions under the Act. I believe that the requirement to produce a signature might be extremely difficult. It seems to me to be a very odd power to give to a police officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may ask this question: if the power to act in this way is already in the House to House Collections Act, what on earth do we want it for again now? Is the Act being repealed or has it been repealed sufficiently?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Viscount Astor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that question is yes. It is being repealed by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend for his undertaking to look at certain aspects of my worry. I shall study what has been said with those who advise me. For the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 111A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 62, line 39, after ("he") insert ("reasonably").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: On behalf of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, I move the amendment. I am so glad that this subsection has not been knocked out. It enables me to help my noble friend, who intends to consider the matter further, by pointing out to him that perhaps inadvertently when describing the desirability of giving this power to constables he used the word "reasonably" in the course of his submission to the Committee. If the word
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
"reasonably" were somehow to be inserted when the subsection is redrafted, it might enable better justice to be achieved. Accordingly, I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that drafting is a particular expertise of my noble friend. I also think that with him it is a slight game. At one moment he moves an amendment to say that we must remove certain words because they are completely unnecessary, and the next time he moves an amendment he says that we must insert some words which we think are quite unnecessary.<br><br>
The fact is that the provision is intended to allow a police constable to make checks on people who are acting as collectors to make sure that they are genuine. The signature which the constable may require can be compared with the signature which the collector may be required by regulations to put on the prescribed certificate. The constable may require the person to provide a name, address and signature only if he believes that the person is acting as a collector. I suggest that the test of reasonableness is already implicit in the subsection because one would not ask a person all those questions if one did not reasonably believe that he was a collector. If a person refused to comply with the constable's request and was prosecuted I doubt whether any court would be likely to convict the person if it became clear that the constable had no reasonable grounds for believing that the person was acting as a collector.<br><br>
I do not wish to go to the stake over it. I shall be happy to consider my noble friend's amendment but I am of the view that the Bill is all right as at presently drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my noble friend. His opening remarks seemed to indicate that he does not believe that great minds always think alike. I am happy to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
On the next amendment, perhaps I may point out there is a mistake on the Marshalled List.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 111C is not, as stated on the Marshalled List, an amendment to Clause 72, but to Clause 73.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord. However, he has moved on to Clause 73. We have not yet decided whether Clause 72, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, that was the point that my noble friend Lord Renton was endeavouring to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the amendment moved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be moved until Clause 72 has been disposed of.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Marshalled List has a misprint in it which has confused the noble Lord the Deputy Chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it has a misprint.</span></p>
<p>Clause 73 [<i>Offences by bodies corporate</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 111C:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 63, line 13, after ("any") insert ("culpable").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, will I am sure agree with me, because he must have considered it on appeals, that there are various kinds of neglect recognised by the law. We are clearly aiming at culpable neglect. The suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, is that the word "culpable" should be inserted. Accordingly, I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A corporate body is just as capable of committing an offence as a natural person. The purpose of Clause 73 is to ensure that where a corporate body—in other words, a company—has committed an offence an officer within the corporate body to whose neglect the commission of the offence was attributable shall also be guilty of an offence.<br><br>
I find it difficult to see how, if a person's neglect has caused the corporate body to commit the offence in question, that person can escape being held to be culpable. The corporate body cannot in practice commit an offence except through the agency of some person or people within it whose actions or omissions must have led to the commission of the offence. If an officer of the company neglects to do something which leads to the conviction of the corporate body for an offence, then clearly that person is culpable. If he were not culpable then no offence could have been committed either by a corporate body or by the officer.<br><br>
Under Clause 73 we are not considering whether an officer may have committed an offence where the corporate body has not, or whether the officer should be guilty instead of the corporate body. We refer to a situation where an offence has been committed and where, therefore, some individual has caused the offence to be committed through his action. The neglect has already led to commission of the offence, and it follows that the neglect is of itself culpable. I hope that I have satisfied my noble friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my noble friend's attempt. However, with deep respect, it oversimplifies the legal position. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, will no doubt wish to consider what my noble friend has said. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p>Clauses 74 to 76 agreed to.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p>Clause 77 [<i>Short title, commencement and extent</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 111B:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 64, line 23, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>("() Notwithstanding subsection (2) above, no provision of this Act shall come into force until 18 months have elapsed from the date it is passed").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment. I should be grateful if whoever replies will give some idea of the Government's timetable with regard to the commencement order. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, raised this point earlier. When are we likely to have the draft regulations? Only when we have the draft regulations will consultation be able to begin?<br><br>
Thereafter there will have to be a very substantial public information campaign. We have in this country about 250,000 charities. The NCVO and many other organisations—I anticipate a point which may be made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton—will have a substantial responsibility for trying to inform the substantial number of charities and their trustees of the provisions of the Bill when it becomes an Act. We have to bear in mind, without going over the ground yet again, that we are introducing substantial criminal penalties for trustees. It seems essential, therefore, that there is adequate time for that public information campaign.<br><br>
I wish to ask a second question arising from that. Who will pay for this public information campaign? The voluntary organisations, such as the NCVO and others, will have to call conferences. They will have to produce literature. They are grant-aided by the Home Office, by the voluntary service unit. Will there be any assistance given to those organisations for that major public information campaign? I shall be grateful if the noble Earl or the noble Viscount will assist me in the matter.<br><br>
I am not wedded to the figure of 18 months, and I do not intend to press the amendment. However, I should be grateful if the Minister will assist the Committee by answering those questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Harris, has quite reasonably asked when it is intended that those measures will come into effect. It is possible to divide the Bill into two parts. One part consists of the provisions which will require a response from trustees to require a change to their existing practices or possibly the adoption of new ones. Such provisions, in which I include in particular the accounting clauses, will only be introduced after much publicity, both general and specific, has been given to the Bill and its new powers. The noble Lord asks who will pay. The commissioners have budgeted for a considerable publicity programme.<br><br>
The other kind of provision in the Bill is that which does not directly affect trustees in their day-to-day work and does not require any immediate adjustment from them. The commissioners' enhanced powers of inquiry and investigation are the kind of things that I have in mind. I am sure that the Committee will agree that there is no reason why they should not be brought into force immediately.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0518">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
The noble Lord, Lord Harris, was concerned that there should be plenty of consultation. There will be and much publicity will be given to the Bill's effects. I understand that the commissioners will be writing to every charity on the register with information about the Bill, if and when it is passed. Even if it would be too costly to tell every charity in minute detail of the exact contents of every clause of the Bill, the major areas such as accounts, changes to the land disposal regime, the clauses relating specifically to smaller charities and others will be fully explained and no registered charity will be left in any doubt that the law has changed in a major way; that is, provided that the commissioners can find the trustees. The commissioners' staff will, as always, be available to give advice on the new law, and trustees will be encouraged to contact them for information.<br><br>
Clearly, it is in no one's interest for the commencement to be rushed through and for trustees to be caught, as it were, on the hop. We would rather that sufficient time were given to allow trustees to learn the new requirements before they must comply with them. In that way the compliance rate will be higher from the outset and the task of the commissioners and the trustees will be easier in the long run. However, we do not intend to delay commencement of those provisions where delay could be damaging to charities.<br><br>
Much of what is in Clauses 7 to 19, for example, is intended to help to stamp out abuse more firmly or to enhance the commissioners' scheme-making and similar powers to aid charity administration. Many charities will have saved up administrative problems which can be dealt with more effectively after the Bill has come into force. They will be anxious for that to happen so that the problems can be resolved by the commissioners as soon as possible. For that reason we believe that it would be inappropriate to delay commencement in the wholesale manner suggested by the noble Lord's amendment, which he fairly said was a probing amendment.<br><br>
The short answer is that those parts of the Bill which deal with regulation and the work of the Charity Commissioners and their regulatory powers will be brought in quickly. Those provisions affecting trustees will be brought in only after considerable consultation has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the noble Earl. As I indicated, this is a probing amendment and no more. However, the noble Earl has not answered one question that I asked. What will be the position of the NCVO and other umbrella organisations which will be involved in organising a major publicity campaign throughout the country? I welcome the fact that the Charity Commission will be sending out information.<br><br>
I welcome even more the fact that it will not be charging for that service. However, the umbrella organisations will be put to substantial cost because inevitably a number of trustees and their representatives will wish to ask questions. It is not only a question of receiving literature from the Charity Commission. Such people will wish to ask detailed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
questions about their responsibilities. I do not ask the noble Earl to reply to my question now. I shall be perfectly content if he will write to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a knowledgeable fellow and I should like to reply to the question now. I apologise for omitting to answer the noble Lord. The basic principle is that the voluntary service unit will not be providing additional funds to voluntary organisations specifically for work on these new provisions. That is part of the work for which we fund them and we will take account of their overall workload.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that is a rather disappointing answer. I do not know whether the noble Earl derived pleasure from the fact that it was an unsatisfactory answer, but it was. These organisations will be put to substantially increased expenditure. There is a terrible tendency of government to pass legislation without providing the resources necessary to ensure that it is effectively implemented. I think that is a mistake. The noble Earl is telling us that under the legislation the NCVO and similar organisations will have to cut back in important areas of their work so that they can carry out this new responsibility. That is not at all satisfactory. I have every intention of returning to the matter. However, having made my point on the commencement order, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>Clause 77 agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 112:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Before Schedule 1, insert the following new schedule:</p>
<p>("SCHEDULE</p>
<p>Section 20 of the Charities Act 1960, As Amended</p>
<p><i>Power to act for protection of charities</i></p>
<p>20.—Where, at any time after they have instituted an inquiry under section 6 of this Act with respect to any charity, the Commissioners are satisfied—
<ol>
<li>that there is or has been any misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of the charity; or</li>
<li>that it is necessary or desirable to act for the purpose of protecting the property of the charity or securing a proper application for the purposes of the charity of that property or of property coming to the charity;</li></ol>
the Commissioners may of their own motion do one or more of the following things, namely—
<ol>
<li>by order suspend any trustee, charity trustee, officer, agent or employee of the charity from the exercise of his office or employment pending consideration being given to his removal (whether under this section or otherwise);</li>
<li>by order appoint such number of additional charity trustees as they consider necessary for the proper administration of the charity;</li>
<li>by order vest any property held by or in trust for the charity in the official custodian for charities, or require the persons in whom any such property is vested to transfer it to him, or appoint any person to transfer any such property to him;</li>
<li>order any person who holds any property on behalf of the charity, or of any trustee for it, not to part with the property without the approval of the Commissioners;</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0519">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
<li>order any debtor of the charity not to make any payment in or towards the discharge of his liability to the charity without the approval of the Commissioners;</li>
<li>by order restrict (notwithstanding anything in the trusts of the charity) the transactions which may be entered into, or the nature or amount of the payments which may be made, in the administration of the charity without the approval of the Commissioners;</li>
<li>by order appoint (in accordance with section 20A of this Act) a receiver and manager in respect of the property and affairs of the charity.</li></ol></p>
<p>(1A) Where, at any time after they have instituted an inquiry under section 6 of this Act with respect to any charity, the Commissioners are satisfied—
<ol>
<li>that there is or has been any misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of the charity; and</li>
<li>that it is necessary or desirable to act for the purpose of protecting the property of the charity or securing a proper application for the purposes of the charity of that property or of property coming to the charity;</li></ol>
the Commissioners may of their own motion do either or both of the following things, namely—
<ol>
<li>by order remove any trustee, charity trustee, officer, agent or employee of the charity who has been responsible for or privy to the misconduct or mismanagement or has by his conduct contributed to it or facilitated it;</li>
<li>by order establish a scheme for the administration of the charity.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(2)The references in subsection (1) or (1A) above to misconduct or mismanagement shall (notwithstanding anything in the trusts of the charity) extend to the employment for the remuneration or reward of persons acting in the affairs of the charity, or for other administrative purposes, of sums which are excessive in relation to the property which is or is likely to be applied or applicable for the purposes of the charity.</p>
<p>(3)The Commissioners may also remove a charity trustee by order made of their own motion—
<ol>
<li>where, within the last five years, the trustee—</li>
<ol>
<li>having previously been adjudged bankrupt or had his estate sequestrated, has been discharged, or</li>
<li>having previously made a composition or arrangement with, or granted a trust deed for, his creditors, has been discharged in respect of it;</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>(aa) where the trustee is a corporation in liquidation;</li>
<li>(ab) where the trustee is incapable of acting by reason of mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983;</li>
</ul>
<li>where the trustee has not acted, and will not declare his willingness or unwillingness to act;</li>
<li>where the trustee is outside England and Wales or cannot be found or does not act, and his absence or failure to act impedes the proper administration of the charity.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(4) The Commissioners may by order made of their own motion appoint a person to be a charity trustee—
<ol>
<li>in place of a charity trustee removed by them under this section or otherwise;</li>
<li>where there are no charity trustees, or where by reason of vacancies in their number or the absence or incapacity of any of their number the charity cannot apply for the appointment;</li>
<li>where there is a single charity trustee, not being a corporation aggregate, and the Commissioners are of opinion that it is necessary to increase the number for the proper administration of the charity;</li>
<li>where the Commissioners are of opinion that it is necessary for the proper administration of the charity to have an additional charity trustee, because one of the existing charity trustees who ought nevertheless to remain a charity trustee either cannot be found or does not act or is outside England and Wales.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(5) The powers of the Commissioners under this section to remove or appoint charity trustees of their own motion shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
include power to make any such order with respect to the vesting in or transfer to the charity trustees of any property as the Commissioners could make on the removal or appointment of a charity trustee by them under section eighteen of this Act.</p>
<p>(6) Any order under this section for the removal or appointment of a charity trustee or trustee for a charity, or for the vesting or transfer of any property, shall be of the like effect as an order made under section eighteen of this Act.</p>
<p>(7) Subject to subsection (7A) below, subsections (10) and (11) of section 18 of this Act shall apply to orders under this section as they apply to orders under that section.</p>
<p>(7A) The requirement to obtain any such certificate or leave as is mentioned in the proviso to section 18(11) shall not apply to—
<ol>
<li>an appeal by a charity or any of the charity trustees of a charity against an order under subsection (1) (vii) above appointing a receiver and manager in respect of the charity's property and affairs, or</li>
<li>an appeal by a person against an order under subsection (1A) (i) or (3) (a) above removing him from his office or employment.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(7B) Subsection (12) of section 18 of this Act shall apply to an order under this section which establishes a scheme for the administration of a charity as it applies to such an order under that section.</p>
<p>(8) The power of the Commissioners to make an order under subsection (1) (i) above shall not be exercisable so as to suspend any person from the exercise of his office or employment for a period of more than twelve months; but (without prejudice to the generality of section 40(1) of this Act) any such order may make provision as respects the period of the suspension for matters arising out of it, and in particular for enabling any person to execute any instrument in his name or otherwise act for him and, in the case of a charity trustee, for adjusting any rules governing the proceedings of the charity trustees to take account of the reduction in the number capable of acting.</p>
<p>(9) Before exercising any jurisdiction under this section otherwise than by virtue of subsection (1) above, the Commissioners shall give notice of their intention to do so to each of the charity trustees, except any that cannot be found or has no known address in the United Kingdom; and any such notice may be given by post and, if given by post, may be addressed to the recipient's last known address in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>(9A) The Commissioners shall, at such intervals as they think fit, review any order made by them under paragraph (i), or any of paragraphs (iii) to (vii), of subsection (1) above; and, if on any such review it appears to them that it would be appropriate to discharge the order in whole or in part, they shall so discharge it (whether subject to any savings or other transitional provisions or not).</p>
<p>(10) If any person contravenes an order under subsection (1) (iv), (v) or (vi) above, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding the fifth level on the standard scale.</p>
<p>(10A) Subsection (10) above shall not be taken to preclude the bringing of proceedings for breach of trust against any charity trustee or trustee for a charity in respect of a contravention of an order under subsection (1) (iv) or (vi) above (whether proceedings in respect of the contravention are brought against him under subsection (10) above or not).</p>
<p>(12) This section shall not apply to an exempt charity.").</p>
<p>The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment is consequential on Amendment No. 14 which has been accepted by the Committee. The amendment itself should be amended by Amendment No. 112A. My proper course is to move Amendment No. 112, although I should prefer to move Amendment No. 112 as amended by Amendment No. 112A. But I understand that I cannot do that. I beg to move.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 112, Amendment No. 112A:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0520">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
<br><blockquote><p>In subsection (8) leave out ("may make provision as respects the period of the suspension") and insert ("made in the case of any person may make provision as respects the period of his suspension").</p></blockquote>
The noble Earl said: This amendment was debated with the earlier amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. I beg to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a Keeling schedule. Such schedules are comparatively rare but exceedingly valuable and helpful. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has taken a great deal of trouble in working out this Keeling schedule and I wish to pay tribute to him. It is a great advantage because we are now able to see exactly how the law is to be amended. That is most helpful to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brightman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, but the thanks are due elsewhere. Someone was most kind and worked out the whole of the Keeling schedule for me.</span></p>
<p>On Question, Amendment No. 112A agreed to.</p>
<p>On Question, Amendment No. 1112, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p>Schedule 1 [<i>Meaning of "connected person" for purposes of section 33(2)</i>]:</p>
<p>[<i>Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p>Schedule 1 agreed to.</p>
<p>Schedules 2 to 4 agreed to.</p>
<p>Schedule 5 [<i>Minor and consequential amendments</i>]:</p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 114A:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 76, line 38, at end insert:</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>("Cathedrals Measure 1963 (No. 2)")</p>
<p>The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 115. These are important drafting amendments and it will be helpful to have them in the Bill.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of the Committee stage. I wish to thank Members of the Committee for the way in which they have expedited the matter. It appeared as though we should sit for two days next week, certainly for one day. The fact that it has been expeditious has not been at the expense of effort or consideration. I am extremely grateful for the way in which Members of the Committee have dealt with the matter.</p>
<p>I have given a number of undertakings to go away and look at matters that have been raised. Of course I shall consider those matters together with others about which I have not given undertakings. A number of points have been raised for which there is no specifically correct solution. We must do the best we can.</p>
<p>It is a rather sad thing, coming at this moment, that at 12 o'clock today the Charity Commissioners announced that the Chief Charity Commissioner, Mr. Robin Guthrie, has announced his resignation from the Charity Commission. It is not quite as bad as it may sound because he has been appointed Director of Social and Economic Affairs in the Council of Europe. He will take up that post in April. He has given immense leadership since he took on the job nearly four years ago. He has done so with great charm, enormous efficiency and great presence. We shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
certainly miss him greatly when he leaves, but obviously he could not refuse this appointment. I beg to move.</p>
<p>1 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Renton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to endorse what my noble friend has said about the splendid work of the Chief Charity Commissioner. Those working in the charity field—and others may have had the same experience—will agree with me that he has been outstanding in the extent to which he has consulted other people outside the organisation of the Charity Commission. That has been most warmly appreciated. Indeed, he carried out a great deal of consultation before advising the Government on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it the opinion of the Committee that I finish calling the amendments to the Bill before we carry on with the general tributes that have been paid?</span></p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 115:
<br><blockquote><p>Page 76, line 39, leave out ("(2)") and insert ("2A.").</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Schedule 5, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p>Schedule 6 [<i>Repeals</i>]:</p>
<p>On Question, Whether Schedule 6 shall be agreed to?</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Swinfen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may intervene for a moment as I think other Members of the Committee may wish to say something about Mr. Robin Guthrie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a short time I shall put the Question whether I report the Bill to the House with amendments. That would be an appropriate moment for Members of the Committee to make their general remarks.</span></p>
<p>Schedule 6 agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish the Bill to seep back into the House without saying two or three words about the way in which the Committee stage has proceeded. I start by echoing the words of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, in his tribute to Mr Robin Guthrie. I have not had much personal contact with him but all those who have speak extremely highly of him and have been very impressed with his work. He is going to an important post. I am sure that he will bring the distinction to that post that he has brought to the one that he will be leaving.<br><br>
I wish to say a few words about our proceedings. This has been a good Committee in the sense that the Bill now leaves us in a better state than when it arrived here. I do not think that that is due only to the formidable nature of the membership of the Committee or indeed to the unanswerable arguments that have been put up from time to time. We should pay tribute to the fact that it is due also to the openness with which the Government have listened to some of the arguments. They have not always listened perhaps totally voluntarily and from time to time we have had to apply the rigours and the lash of a Vote. Nevertheless, I pay tribute, as I have on previous occasions, to the way in which the noble Earl has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0521">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
conducted these affairs on behalf of the Government. He has done it with charm, candour, openness and, if I may say so, reliability. I pay tribute to him. I pay tribute also to the noble Viscount. This is the first Committee on which I have had the pleasure of sitting with him. I do not know how many he has done, but if this is his blooding, he has been well and truly blooded.<br><br>
I understand that the procedure is somewhat novel. It has not often happened in this form. In a sense it is a reflection on the procedures that whether it has been a success or not does not depend on the Committee. The Committee on the whole has done a good job with the Bill. Whether the procedure is a success will depend upon what happens when the Bill goes back to the House. Certainly so far as the party for which I speak is concerned, we will do our best at least to point out to noble Lords that some issues about which they feel passionately have already been discussed in Committee and they may therefore not think that there is the same urgency to refer to matters again on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
On the whole it has been a friendly Committee. One of the advantages of conducting business in this way is that those unseen people who are usually in the Box, although they still remain silent, become very much more visible. It means that the Government obtain the answers much more quickly than they would in the House. That is an advantage.<br><br>
On behalf of the Labour Party I thank the Government and other Members of the Committee for the way in which it has been conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the words of the noble Lord, Lord Richard. It has been an agreeable Committee. The Bill leaves us a great deal better than when it arrived. The undertakings the Government have given to look at a number of points of substance were welcomed by everyone, as was the smile of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers.<br><br>
I agree also with what the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said about the Report stage of the Bill. I know it is not the responsibility of the noble Earl but, given the discussions which have taken place through the usual channels, we expect the Report stage to be fairly early in the New Year. I am sure that the Government understand our anxiety on that issue.<br><br>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Richard, I feel that the success of the experiment—because experiment it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
—depends to a large extent on what happens at Report stage and Third Reading. Like him I want it to be a success. There is a great advantage in holding Public Bill Committees in this way. We cannot do so on high profile, politically sensitive Bills, but the detailed consideration we have been able to give to the Bill has been more satisfactory than it would have been had we been conducting the business on the Floor of the House. Speaking for my colleagues, I repeat that we shall do our best to ensure that when the Bill reaches the House, we are not overwhelmed by a flood of amendments covering exactly the same ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say one or two words and I know my two noble friends from the Cross-Benches wish to be associated with them. We have found this procedure an interesting experience. We are grateful for the way in which the Ministers have responded to some of our proposals. I agree that on the whole it has been a friendly Committee, although we came to some conclusions not very agreeable to the Government.<br><br>
Subject to what happens on Report, my view is that the experiment has been worth while and it has been interesting. If it means that the Bill finds its way on to the statute book before the election when otherwise it would not, the experiment is justified. Only time will show.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Earl Ferrers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to Members of the Committee for those remarks. I repeat that I am grateful also for the way in which the Committee stage was conducted; it has been a friendly Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, says, if it enables the Bill to get on to the statute book without any undue hiccup, it will be a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Question is, That I report the Bill to the House with amendments. As many as are of that opinion will say "Content".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Members of the Committee</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Content.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the contrary "Not-Content". The Contents have it. That concludes the Committee's proceedings on the Bill.<br><br>
The Committee adjourned at ten minutes past one o'clock.</span></p>
