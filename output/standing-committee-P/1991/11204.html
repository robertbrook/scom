	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>CHARITIES BILL [H.L.]</h1></div>
	<time>Wednesday, 4th December, 1991</time>
	<p>	<b>The Committee met at ten o'clock.</b></p>
	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>
	<p>Debate resumed on Clause 3.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 6:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 3, line 7, after ("whose") insert ("gross").</p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment seeks only to clarify Clause 3(4) of the Bill. In line 7, page 3 of the Bill, one sees the formula for registration:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and whose income from all sources does not in aggregate amount to more than £1,000 a year".</p></blockquote>
Does that refer to gross income or net income? In Clause 41(1) the Bill uses the expression "gross income". It is exactly the same in Clause 42(1) (b). Presumably "income" in Clause 3(4) means gross income. If that is so, I submit that the Bill should so state. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the intention behind the amendment. As the noble and learned Lord said, there are other references in the Bill to gross income, but it looks a little odd that that phrase is not used in Clause 3. However, I hope that I can assure the noble and learned Lord that his amendment is not necessary. Clause 3 amends Section 4 of the 1960 Act and it therefore attracts the definitions of various terms contained in Section 45 of that Act. Paragraph 18 of Schedule 2 to the Bill amends Section 45 of the 1960 Act. This amended Section 45 makes it clear that references in the 1960 Act to "income from all sources" should be construed by reference to the gross revenues of the charity. That has the same effect on the meaning of Clause 3 as would this amendment. I hope that with that slightly complicated explanation the noble and learned Lord will see that I have answered his points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Viscount. I am sure that it is due to my own denseness that I have not picked up the definition referred to in Section 45 of the Charities Act 1960. Can he point out where in the Charities Act 1960 one finds a definition of income as meaning gross income?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Clause 45(4) as amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are awaiting further consideration of that important point, perhaps I may ask my noble friend Lord Ferrers whether he has had any thought about the grouping of amendments for the Committee stage. When such Bills are taken in Committee on the Floor of the Chamber we often have the advantage of groupings. If there are to be groupings it would be helpful to know and to have them. It may be that the amendments are grouped and that I have not managed to pick up the piece of paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some grouping of amendments. I see that the pigeon post has operated and that my noble friend now has a list of groupings. I hope that that will satisfy him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful. I came in by the back door of the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the noble Viscount say that Clause 45(4) was amended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said "as amended" and not "was amended".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what the noble Viscount has said. It is clear by reference to Clause 45(4) that income means gross income. I still believe that the Bill would be more user friendly if income were written as gross income so that persons who read the Bill so not draw any distinctions by reference to Clauses 41 and 42. I accept that it is clear, but as a matter of interpretation it would be easier for the reader if income were written as gross income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the noble and learned Lord's point. Between now and Report stage I am prepared, without any agreement to do anything, to look at the point again and see whether we can improve the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful. In the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 6A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 3, line 19, leave out from ("money") to end of line 21.</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, is not, I understand, a Member of the Committee. I hope that it will be in order for me to move his amendment formally. I do not express any views upon it but, bearing in mind the great experience of the noble and learned Lord, it would be helpful to know the Government's attitude to his amendment. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the noble and learned Lord's amendment were agreed to it would remove from the Secretary of State the power to amend the financial limit below which certain charities are excepted from the requirement to register in order to extend the scope of the exception. It would only be able to do so to reflect changes in the value of money. We do not think that the Secretary of State's power should be constrained in that way. Experience may well show that it is desirable to widen the exception to the requirement to register. It could be, for instance, that the commissioners might find that charities at the lower end of the income scale are all operating with such probity and accountability that more of them could be excepted from the requirement to register. It gives the Secretary of State that flexibility. But any order made by the Secretary of State to extend it would be subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that explanation. We all know how strongly opposed the noble and learned Lord is to anything approaching a Henry VIII clause which enables a Minister to amend an Act of Parliament by secondary legislation. But quite clearly the time of Parliament is saved and expedition is achieved if, when minor amendments have to be made to keep pace with inflation, power is given to Ministers to do so. That is what the explanation of my noble friend Lord Ferrers comes to. I am prepared to accept it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 7:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Leave out Clause 3 and insert the following new clause:</p>
	<p>	<i>("Registration of Charities</i></p>
	<p>	<i>The register of charities</i></p>
	<p>3. For section 4 of the 1960 Act there shall be substituted the following section—</p>
	<p>	<i>"Register of charities.</i></p>
	<p>4.—(1)The Commissioners shall continue to keep a register of charities, which shall be kept by them in such manner as they think fit.</p>
	<p>(2)There shall be entered in the register every charity not excepted by subsection (5) below; and a charity so excepted may be entered in the register at the request of the charity, but (whether or not it was excepted at the time of registration) may at any time, and shall at the request of the charity, be removed from the register.</p>
	<p>(3)The register shall contain—
	<ol>
	<li>the name of every registered charity; and</li>
	<li>such other particulars of, and such other information relating to, every such charity as the Commissioners think fit.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(4)Any institution which no longer appears to the Commissioners to be a charity shall be removed from the register, with effect, where the removal is due to any change in its purposes or trusts, from the date of that change; and there shall also be removed from the register any charity which ceases to exist or does not operate.</p>
	<p>(5)The following charities are not required to be registered, that is to say,—
	<ol>
	<li>any charity comprised in the Second Schedule to this Act (in this Act referred to as an "exempt charity");</li>
	<li>any charity which is excepted by order or regulations;</li>
	<li>any charity which has neither—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>any permanent endowment, nor</li>
	<li>the use or occupation of any land, and whose income from all sources does not in aggregate amount to more than £1,000 a year;</li></ol></ol>
and no charity is required to be registered in respect of any registered place of worship.</p>
	<p>(6)With any application for a charity to be registered there shall be supplied to the Commissioners copies of its trusts (or, if they are not set out in any extant document, particulars of them), and such other documents or information as may be prescribed or as the Commissioners may require for the purpose of the application.</p>
	<p>(7)It shall be the duty—
	<ol>
	<li>of the charity trustees of any charity which is not registered nor excepted from registration to apply for it to be registered, and to supply the documents and information required by subsection (6) above; and</li>
	<li>of the charity trustees (or last charity trustees) of any institution which is for the time being registered to notify the Commissioners if it ceases to exist, or if there is any change in its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
trusts, or in the particulars of it entered in the register, and to supply to the Commissioners particulars of any such change and copies of any new trusts or alterations of the trusts;</li></ol>
and any person who makes default in carrying out any of the duties imposed by this subsection may be required by order of the Commissioners to make good that default.</p>
	<p>(8)The register (including the entries cancelled when institutions are removed from the register) shall be open to public inspection at all reasonable times; and copies (or particulars) of the trusts of any registered charity as supplied to the Commissioners under this section shall, so long as it remains on the register, be kept by them and be open to public inspection at all reasonable times, except in so far as regulations otherwise provide.</p>
	<p>(9)Where any information contained in the register is not in documentary form, subsection (8) above shall be construed as requiring the information to be available for public inspection in legible form at all reasonable times.</p>
	<p>(10)If the Commissioners so determine, that subsection shall not apply to any particular information contained in the register and specified in their determination.</p>
	<p>(11)Nothing in the foregoing subsections shall require any person to supply the Commissioners with copies of schemes for the administration of a charity made otherwise than by the court, or to notify the Commissioners of any change made with respect to a registered charity by such a scheme, or require a person, if he refers the Commissioners to a document or copy already in the possession of the Commissioners, to supply a further copy of the document; but where by virtue of this subsection a copy of any document need not be supplied to the Commissioners, a copy of it, if it relates to a registered charity, shall be open to inspection under subsection (8) above as if supplied to the Commissioners under this section.</p>
	<p>(12)If he thinks it expedient to do so—
	<ol>
	<li>in consequence of changes in the value of money, or</li>
	<li>with a view to extending the scope of the exception provided for by subsection (5) (c) above,</li></ol>
the Secretary of State may by order amend subsection (5) (c) by substituting a different sum for the sum for the time being specified there.</p>
	<p>(13)Any such order shall be made by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</p>
	<p>(14)In this section "registered place of worship" means any land or building falling within section nine of the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855, as amended by this Act (that is to say, the land and buildings which, if this Act had not been passed, would by virtue of that section as amended by subsequent enactments be partially exempted from the operation of the Charitable Trusts Act 1853), and for the purposes of this subsection "building" includes part of a building.".").</p>
	<p>The noble Lord said: This amendment could be regarded as something between a protest and the expression of a forlorn hope that the Government may be persuaded to abandon or at least to modify what I regard as a deplorable habit; that is, they amend an Act without there being any immediate or near prospect of consolidating the measure. That not only makes difficult the process of legislation but much more serious, it places great difficulty in front of those who administer charities and who do not always have very large staffs or many skilled advisers available to them.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
	<p>I am advised that the 1960 Act has already been amended twice. It is possible that without my knowledge there have been further amendments but I am sure that it has been amended on two occasions. The Bill contains some 14 clauses which propose to amend parts of the 1960 Act. The outcome of that is not easy for anyone to follow.</p>
	<p>My amendment—and I wish to make this absolutely clear to the Committee—does not propose any changes to the 1960 Act or the subsequent amendments or any change to this Bill. Its aim is to set out the law as the Government hope it will be when Parliament has finished with the Bill, assuming that there are no amendments. The language is not mine but emanates from successive governments. I have made no attempt whatever to change it.</p>
	<p>There is no need for me to dwell at length on the point which I hope is reasonably clear to the Committee. I am not wedded to the wording, nor am I particularly anxious that it should be in the form of a clause. Indeed, so anxious am Ito be of assistance to my noble friend and to save him any difficulties that if he were minded to say that he understands the anxieties which I seek to express and that at a later stage he will bring forward this proposal in the form of a schedule, I shall be more than happy to withdraw the amendment. I wish to be as reasonable as the circumstances and my noble friend allow. I have no desire to engage in a battle with the Government on this point unless they continue with what I regard as a deplorable habit. If they do so, I wish to take any steps available to me to provide at least a possibility of a cure. However, I hope that that will not be necessary. I beg to move.</p>
	<p>10.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment looking at it from the point of view of the users. I have visited three charitable organisations and I asked to see the 1960 Act. Not one had a copy of that Act. Admittedly they were people with not a great deal of knowledge. However, from the point of view of the user, it is far easier to have matters written onto the face of the Bill rather than linked to another Act—in this case, the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I support my noble friend Lord Peyton in his hope that it may take the form of a schedule rather than form part of the main part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this amendment. It covers the same point as arises on my Amendment No. 14. With the permission of the Committee, I shall make a brief reference to that amendment because the point behind it is exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 20 of the 1960 Act is extremely important. It contains three pages of print setting out the powers conferred on the Charity Commissioners to protect charities. Clause 9 amends Section 20 and adds to those powers. It covers two and a half pages of print. Seven of the existing subsections are amended and new subsections are added, some by way of addition and some by way of substitution. Section 20 is such an important section that I submit it would be a service to the reader if the amended Section 20 could be set
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
out in a Keeling schedule so that the reader does not have to cope with a patchwork of cross-references. Members of the Committee will see Section 20 of the 1960 Act set out as amended in Amendment No. 112. That would go into a schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My preference would be that the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, should be placed in a schedule in the same way as is my proposed Amendment No. 14. This is a matter of principle. It is a matter of producing legislation which the ordinary person can follow with ease. As I said before, it will make the Act user friendly. I support the noble Lord's amendment and I prefer that it should be in the form of a schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what has been said by the noble and learned Lord and, indeed, by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton. We are talking about the intelligibility of the statute. It seems obvious that this is the right thing to do. We must accept that, and the point has been made on a number of previous occasions. We are talking about a large number of people who are trustees of charities who must try to understand what is the intention of Parliament. It seems to me that this proposal will make their task a great deal easier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment on behalf of the practitioner. In particular I support the general principle that it should apply to all amending legislation. Experience as a practitioner over 30 odd years is that many hours are spent with scissors and paste trying to stick together various Acts and make sense of them. It would be enormously helpful if it could take the form of a schedule. I cannot understand why that is not general practice. The principle is extremely important. An extraordinary number of hours are wasted in trying to make sense of the legislation and yet this Government say that they are dedicated to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments. It is terribly important that people outside should be able to grasp and appreciate the contents of the Bill without too much difficulty. At present this Committee must sit down with the 1960 Act, with the Bill and with the amendments and somehow or other we must try to read the three together. That is an extremely difficult task even for a trained lawyer. I should think that for someone who is not a trained lawyer it is almost impossible. The merits behind the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, are unanswerable and I hope the Government will respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support Amendments Nos. 7, 14 and 112. I believe that the argument is going along the lines that the whole Bill should be reconstituted and consolidated at this stage. That is not practical in the short term. It would be extremely helpful if the Government would take note of the fact that Members of the Committee have tabled amendments which select special sections that require this treatment for the benefit of charities.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
All of us who have anything to do with charities must know how important it is, particularly now, for them to be quite certain where their powers and responsibilities lie. These sections, as they will be, will be particularly suitable to be treated in the way the noble Lord suggested. I hope that the Government will be as sympathetic to the amendment as they possibly can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must declare an interest, as I did at Second Reading, because I work for a charity. I apologise to the Committee for not declaring that interest when I spoke yesterday.

The proposal of my noble friend Lord Peyton is extremely important for charities. The one that I work for could probably afford to hire a lawyer to do the interpretation for it. But there are many smaller charities that certainly do not have lawyers working for them and cannot afford to hire a lawyer, except in an emergency, and many more that only have volunteers working for them part-time. To simplify their understanding of the law in this way would be a considerable help to them and often prevent a waste of charitable funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Peyton for saying that he was anxious not to engage in any argument with the Government. That is to me a matter for rejoicing. I understand his anxieties, and my noble friend Lord Mottistone is quite right when he says that this is not the time for the Bill to be consolidated and reconstituted. It is not the right moment to do this. I believe that there will be an opportunity at a later time for these Acts on charities to be consolidated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could interrupt my noble friend. I did not say "reconstituted"; I said "consolidated". I also said that this is not the right time for consolidation but it is the right time for selected sections to be identified as ones that should be treated in the way the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the point my noble friend is making. There was discussion regarding a Keeling schedule. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, said that we should not be beguiled by it. I looked into the matter to see whether it would be possible to do something of that nature. I feel inclined to tell the Committee what I found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything that makes legislation easier is for the benefit not only of legislation but also those who read it and try to put it into action. Keeling schedules as such are included in legislation mostly as the exception and not the rule. I discovered that to incorporate one in the Bill would add some 40 pages to the length of the Bill; that is three times the length of the two Acts referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, at Second Reading, with all the handling difficulties that that would entail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also possible that if a Keeling schedule were included some people might be misled into thinking the schedule was completely exhaustive as to the matters relating to charity law. An example would be Section 29 of the Act which refers to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
commissioner's consent which is required in certain land transactions. If that were to be repealed and replaced by a new regime created by Clauses 33 to 36, the schedule would show the deletion of Clause 29 but it would not show the new regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long run, the most satisfactory way of setting out the law on charities in a way which would assist the charities, the commissioner, the legal profession and others would be to consolidate the enactments. I shall certainly lend what weight I can to the argument for early consolidation. In the shorter term, an updated version of the 1960 Act can be issued in her Majesty's Stationery Office series of volumes for 	<i>Statutes in Force.</i> I propose to write to the editor asking that a revision in relation to charities be given high priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the view I take in regard to the Keeling schedule principle. But that does not mean that it is not possible to incorporate it in a number of important areas in the Bill. We shall come to Amendment No. 14 tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But perhaps I may refer to Amendment No. 6 moved by my noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil. I sympathise with him because he wants to make the law clear. However, the changes to the present Section 4 are relatively minor and simply empower the commissioners to keep their register of charities in a computerised form and include more information on the register in regard to the registered charities than is now possible. Given the minor nature of the changes proposed, re-enacting Section 4 in full is a little unnecessary and could have the unfortunate result of making it difficult to see exactly what changes have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that Members of the Committee have spoken with anxiety on this matter. I am certainly prepared between now and Report to see what can be done to produce something like a Keeling schedule to set out Section 4 as amended. It will give readers the help the movers and supporters are looking for without the detrimental effects I explained. If it would be convenient for the Committee and the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, I shall consider what can be done before the next stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my noble friend Lord Peyton replies, perhaps I can say that we should all perhaps be grateful to my noble friend Lord Ferrers for explaining the position. However, there is one further point I should like to make. I wonder if I dare refer to the Committee on the Preparation of Legislation, which was, after all, the first inquiry for 100 years into our methods of granting and tabling legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That committee stated that the principles of an Act of Parliament should be stated in the sections; in other words, the clauses as we have them at Committee stage. When we need to go into detail—thinking particularly of administrative detail of the kind involved in Section 4 of the 1960 Act—it should be incorporated in a schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had we been in possession of the recommendations of the committee in 1960—it did not report until 1975—I am sure that we would have considered including Section 4 in a schedule. It essentially deals with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
matters of administrative detail. Therefore, when my noble friend Lord Ferrers is considering the matter further, I hope that he will consider not only the advantage of partial consolidation as put forward by my noble friend Lord Peyton but also the advantage of simplifying the structure of the Act, as it will become, by this administrative detail being contained in a schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly see whether it is possible to incorporate this into a schedule. On the point of partial consolidation, we should perhaps put the warning flags up a little. If we do partially consolidate an Act or a number of Acts, that will deflect the total consolidation at a later date. The noble Lord shakes his head, but there are a number of candidates for consolidation. Should those who deal with the matter think, "Oh well, the Charity Bill has already been partly consolidated", then they may not wish to consolidate it in total. That is a danger. Having said that, I shall certainly see whether it is possible to do as my noble friend suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I chose Section 4 of the 1960 Act and Clause 3 of this Bill not because I thought they were the most important, but simply because they came first. I wanted to give early notice to the Government of my unhappiness to the continuation of what I have already described as a deplorable habit. I cannot be other than grateful to my noble friend Lord Ferrers for the way in which he has received these arguments. He has promised that he will see what can be done. On the other hand, he has made it clear that if Keeling schedules were put in it might defer the date of consolidation. I find that argument particularly unimpressive. I am not a great admirer of our procedures. When necessary consolidating measures are delayed indefinitely, and are quite beyond any power of mine to understand or are beyond any reasonable explanation, I regard that as quite unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The length of a Bill has not always proved to be an insuperable argument which has weighed that heavily with the Government. Bills emerge of inordinate length. In this particular instance I see no reason for objecting to their length. It may be that the Bill itself may be increased in bulk, but nevertheless the bulk of the law is not altered. I hope that I am making myself clear. All that happens is that the poor, unfortunate people who have to administer it and accept its guidance, will find it very much easier, and also access to it. Therefore, their understanding does not involve so much pain and effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be minded to ask leave to withdraw the amendment if my noble friend could make two things absolutely clear. First, the possibility of a Keeling schedule to the clause receiving very serious consideration which the Government themselves will move at a later stage, and, secondly, that the Government will be minded to accept the principle of a Keeling schedule in the later amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
regards Clause 9. I accept that that is a more important clause where the arguments for a Keeling schedule are even more potent than they are in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my noble friend two questions. First, will he make absolutely clear what he is prepared to do in the interval between now and Report stage as regards this amendment? Secondly, will he tell me what his attitude will be—I am sure that the noble and learned Lord will forgive me for speaking to his amendment -—and that of the Government to the noble and learned Lord's amendment to Clause 9? It is my own decision as to whether or not I press the amendment, but I shall be very much influenced by the replies to those two questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend is a very hard person to satisfy. I told him that I shall be prepared to take this matter away to see whether it is possible to put something of the nature of a Keeling schedule into the schedules as regards Sections 4 and 20. He then asks what is the Government's view as regards Amendment No. 14 of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. I was hoping to have waited until we come to that amendment. I think that my noble friend is rather like a person at Christmas time wanting to open all the boxes underneath the tree at once to see if there is something nice in them. I was hoping that such pleasures might be left until a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my noble friend asks me too much I think that he will find that, as regards Amendment No. 14, there will be a sympathetic response to it. Therefore, I hope that I have assured my noble friend enough that I intend to take away his amendment to see whether we can put into the Bill a Keeling schedule of that nature concerning Sections 4 and 20. I hope that in that respect he will think that he, myself, and the Government whom I have the honour of representing and of which he is an ardent supporter, are no longer behaving in a deplorable fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be the last to ever regard myself as hard to satisfy. I believe that I err on the side of being too easily pleased. Be that as it may, my noble friend's reasonableness makes it very difficult for me to pursue this matter at this stage without appearing unduly obstinate, which I would never wish to be. I am most grateful to my noble friend for his acknowledgment of my enthusiastic support for the Government, even though that enthusiastic support is tinged with deepest sorrow and dismay at the way they still fall victim to deplorable habits from time to time. However, having this morning received some signs of light from the Government I am somewhat encouraged. Therefore, I look forward with some eagerness to the Amendment No. 14 to be moved by the noble and learned Lord. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>Page 3, line 30, after ("English") insert ("or, if appropriate, Welsh").</p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
The noble Lord said: Whatever amendments may be down on the Marshalled List as far as this Bill is concerned, this is transparently one that the Government should accept. I say two things about it. If it is left that everything has to be in English that will cause deep offence in Wales. It will also cause deep offence, I imagine, in places in the far north of Scotland. I do not know whether Cornish is still a functioning language anywhere, but wherever there is a significant ethnic minority which speaks and cherishes its own language it should be provided for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Government might say that the matter can be dealt with in English and Welsh. That would not be considered good enough in certain parts of Wales at the moment. Matters have moved on since the 1960 Act. The last time that I had to make a speech in Caernarvon I discovered that there was simultaneous translation provided from English into Welsh. The extent to which Welsh has become much more a living and working language than it was 30 or 40 years ago has to be recognised by the Government. If a purely Welsh charity is raising money purely in Welsh-speaking Wales for Welsh-speaking purposes, it will cause deep offence to them if, on their cheques for example, they have to have the name of the charity in English as well as in Welsh. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that to start with I must be grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, moved the amendment and not the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, otherwise we would run the risk of having it in Welsh. However, as drafted the clause requires the statement to be given in English as a matter of obligation. That does not preclude the trustees from providing the same information to be given in whatever other language or languages that the trustees wish. That could be many other languages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the trustees in Welsh-speaking areas will want to put the information in Welsh as well, because it would clearly be helpful to people seeing the prescribed documents; but we do not think it appropriate for the information to be given in Welsh alone, any more than in Scotland it should be given in Gaelic, because the range and type of documents on which the information must be shown would make it extremely unlikely that only Welsh speakers will see or handle them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are conscious of the interests of Welsh speakers, and I know that the Charity Commissioners have found their discussions on this subject over the past two years with the Welsh Language Board very helpful. We do not want to do anything in the Bill that would preclude the use of Welsh, or indeed any other language, where appropriate, and Clause 4 does not do so. It also allows the prescribed information to be given in any other language that the trustees may wish to use. I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will see the sense of what I said and withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I have some sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said, I do not agree with him. The charity for which I work finds no difficulty when operating in Wales in having English
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
translated into Welsh, where appropriate. Occasionally, we have some difficulty in deciding whether it is the language of North Wales or the language of South Wales, because I believe they are very different. To which one does the noble Lord refer in the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord provokes me. There is little difference in written Welsh whether it is in Caernarvon or Carmarthen. I hear what the Government have said. It was entirely predictable. I think that offence will be caused in certain parts of Wales, because Welsh has now become a much more important language and is not merely an adjunct which is spoken by some of the population. I included the words "if appropriate" so that it should apply only, and can be used only, in appropriate circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says that he cannot accept that wording, I wonder whether he would accept "and, if appropriate, Welsh", instead of "or, if appropriate, Welsh". I am anxious that somewhere in the Bill there is at least a nod in the direction of a recognition that Wales has a separate language and is anxious to preserve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Richard, pointed out the weakness of the argument when he said that the document should be in Welsh where the trustees feel it appropriate. What is appropriate? How does one define appropriate? I am sure that most people in some parts of Wales speak Welsh, but there must be people there who could be beneficiaries of charities who do not speak Welsh. Are we to exclude them? That cannot be fair. We have encouraged the fact that documents can be in both languages. That seems to be eminently fair. Welsh is a language that can be used in conjunction with English. That is in no way intended as a slight on Welsh or any other language in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not merely talking about Welsh. It may be any of the many other languages. If I remember correctly, copies of the document on the health service produced by the Government the other day were in nine languages. Charities could have documents in nine languages, but it is important that they are also in English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall of course ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but if the Minister is going to tell the people of Wales that their language is to be considered on a par with perhaps eight or nine other ethnic languages—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is the implication behind what the Minister said. He is making a great mistake and he will run into a great deal of trouble. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 9:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 3, line 37, leave out ("cheques").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I shall not detain the Committee for long on the amendment. I appreciate that the clause is designed to protect the public in their dealings with charities and, in effect, bring them into line with companies legislation dealing with charitable companies. However, I am worried about a small charity having to go to the expense and trouble of having the information put onto its cheques. It is not just a question of putting its name on, as most of us have on our cheques; it is the requirement contained in the clause that the fact that it is a registered charity should be stated in legible characters on a cheque which is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point which arises in respect of small charities, of one of which I happen to be chairman, is that we give money to individuals in the village; for example, to buy a wheelchair. We are not terribly keen on it being advertised that the money is reaching the individual from a charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am bound to say that I recognise that the amendment is defective in that, although in the normal course small charities do not have much involvement with bills of exchange and promissory notes, I gather that the definition of "bills of exchange" could be regarded as including cheques whether they are mentioned in the statute or not. Before taking the amendment away and considering whether a more suitable form of words should be evolved for the next stage, I should like to seek the Government's reaction to the idea lying behind the amendment. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of Clause 4 is to require registered charities to include a statement indicating that they are so registered on certain documents issued by the charity. That requirement will signal that the charity concerned is subject to the supervisory regime of the Charity Commissioners. It seems to us that a person entering into an agreement to supply goods or services to a charity should, by virtue of the statement which the clause will require to appear on the charity's cheques and other documents, know that he or she is dealing with a charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the provision will not increase charities' administrative costs. Most, if not all, banks provide cheque books without charge, and the inclusion of one or two additional words on the cheque book should not affect that. Moreover, the inclusion of the statement will aid banks and building societies to identify accounts belonging to charities for the purpose of Clause 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing Section 30C of the 1960 Act requires charities that are companies to state that they are charities on a range of documents, including cheques. I see no reason why unincorporated charities should not be subject to a similar requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord also mentioned a village where a charity might hand out sums of money to individuals. He said that there might be some embarrassment. That may be the case, but it is open to the charity to make money available by other means; for example, a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
postal order. They could easily do that and it would solve the problem. I hope that that explains the Government's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, will forgive me. I had hoped that my noble friend would be able to remove my doubts about the amendment. I cannot understand what the provision will do to help or protect anyone. I should make it clear that I am chairman of a charitable trust. I cannot for the life of me see that the provision will be anything but a minor nuisance. It is not worth pressing very hard. The inclusion of the words on the cheques will achieve nothing. They will not warn anyone; and they will not give to anyone information that they do not already have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people dealing with charities are already clearly aware of the fact. I cannot see why the Government should wish to sprinkle a few extra words into the Bill. I hope that they will not persist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister underestimates the embarrassment that could be caused to people who are receiving money from charitable funds on an individual basis. They do not always receive small sums. In some case they receive very large sums. They would of necessity be paid by cheque, for the convenience of the charity in its administration, accounting and auditing. They want that money to be paid by cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A family may be trying to maintain its position in its own society and receiving a large sum of money from a charity, sometimes on a regular basis, through a small local bank. It should not be, but it could be known locally, that that money was coming in. That could cause considerable embarrassment to the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of what happens when a charity starts up and needs to distribute funds fairly quickly but does not yet have a chequebook with its name printed on the cheques. If the charity used cheques without those words printed on them the charity would be breaking the law. The Government should, in my view, take the matter away for further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may answer my noble friend's last point first. If a chequebook has not yet been printed one can very easily write all the relevant information on the cheque above the space where one signs one's name. The bank will honour those cheques. That is not a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend said that the sums involved might be large. In that case the person receiving the cheque is not going to go down to the village post office and cash a considerable sum. He will pay the cheque into the bank. I do not believe that that is a valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the new Section 4A(b) which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in all bills of exchange, promissory notes, endorsements, cheques and orders for money or goods purporting to be signed on behalf of the charity".</p></blockquote>
It would be very odd to take out one tiny item if everything else showed the information regarding the charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be perfectly happy to see the whole lot come out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I revert to the point which I made at the start. We intend to signal that the charity concerned is subject to the supervisory regime of the commissioners and that those entering into business or legal transactions with the charity know that that is the case. That is an important principle and it is the central purpose of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main aims of the Bill is that there should not be misuse of charitable funds. Would it not be a form of protection that cheques being circulated included information identifying where they came from; namely, from a charitable source? That is very much of benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What one has to put on the cheque is not just the name of the charity but, according to this clause, the fact that it is a registered charity; and one has to state that in English. To go back to my Welsh charity with an income of £1,100 a year, not only does it have to have its cheques printed in English as well as in Welsh - and I leave that aside because your Lordships have considered that point already - but in addition it has to state not only the name of the charity itself but the fact that it is a registered charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What goes on the cheque? Is it "Llangyfelach Cricket Club, a registered charity under the terms of the Charities Act 1991"? Is that is what is to go on the cheque, in English as well as Welsh? It is nonsense. It seems to me that the Government have fallen into the error of trying to prescribe for the thousands of small charities in this country which make up the vast majority of charitable institutions the sort of rules which are appropriate to a vast charity with a large income. It is probably of no concern to the Save the Children Fund to have to put on the cheque "Save the Children Fund, a registered charity". That is quite an easy thing to do. But at the sharp end of the charitable world, where there are thousands of little charities all trying to raise money for a specific purpose this is an imposition. It is an unnecessary one. The Government ought to look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up a point made by my noble friend Lord Swinfen on the question of confidentiality. Suppose a widow receives a cheque from an organisation. She lives in a small market town and does not want people to know her business. One would say that if she paid the cheque into the bank that would not be known, but it would be known. I have come across such cases. We ought to consider the question of confidentiality from the point of view of people who do not want others to know their business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend Lord Astor mentioned several occasions when it would be necessary for such information to be available to people with whom the charities are doing business. On all such occasions that cheque would be accompanied by a letter with the charity's letterhead and the relevant information shown on that letterhead. It is not necessary for it to be on the cheque.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe we are making a meal of this. We are being consistent in saying that this information should be shown on the documents which the charities produce. One cannot require it on some and not others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Richard, asked how one would fit all the information on the cheque for a Welsh charity. One has to say "registered charity", together with its number. I cannot speak Welsh but I believe numbers are the same in Welsh as in English. I cannot see that that is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lady Faithfull said that there might be a problem in relation to banks. Banks treat their customers with great confidentiality. I believe that we ought to maintain consistency. The most important point is that people should know that they are dealing with registered charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Ironside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Allen, because of my own experience. I am chairman of a body of trusts which consists of a number of charities, many of which are small charities. Awards are made to individuals, but the cheques are written from one account by the administrative trust. A letter is also written supporting the cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of the bank and many other organisations the administrative trust, with that one account, is understood to be the body which is connected with the charities. I should have thought that it was unnecessary to give the registration number of the charity and the name of the charity on every cheque. That can be done with a rubber stamp, but it adds to the burdens on companies and trusts and others who administer small charities. I hope that the Minister will look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a simple answer to the point of my noble friend Lord Ironside. When banks print cheques they can include the name of a person or of two people in a partnership, or a long and complicated company name. That is standard practice, it is not difficult. That is the important point—for banks to print the information on cheques. They do it all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having come to the matter with an open mind and having listened to this discussion I find myself convinced by what my noble friend Lord Astor had to say.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that the debate would go on for quite so long as it has. I am most grateful for the support I have received. If I may say so, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is slightly innocent about the practices of banks in this country. They go around looking for ways and means of charging charities. I am afraid that we would end up with the small charities having to pay for this information to be put on their cheques. In all other

transactions—buying things and dealing with outside companies—the rest of the clause would cover the situation. But as regards cheques, I am afraid that what has been said on behalf of the Government simply bears out the feeling—we shall come to this a good deal more at later stages of the Bill—that the Government do not have the slightest idea of how the small charities have to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the provisions are drawn up with an eye to the big charities. I would certainly go along with the noble Baroness in saying that in a small village the confidentiality of a cheque presented to the local bank is simply non-existent. As I said at the beginning, the amendment in its present form will not do. I shall withdraw it but I give notice that I shall consider what has been said in time for the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord is wrong on one point. He said that the provision would impose an extra cost on charities via the banks. That is not correct. When one asks a bank to send a cheque book and to print the cheques, it does not charge any more because one puts on them the name "Lord Allen of Abbeydale" than if one put the noble Lord's name, the registered charity and a number. The bank does not charge any more for putting on those few extra letters. Where a very small charity writes out five, six or 10 cheques a year, it is perfectly proper for the person writing out those cheques to write above his signature the name of the charity and the number of the cheque.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Viscount has not answered the point about confidentiality. He has not taken it up at all. He should bear in mind that a large number of people in this country still do not have bank accounts. That is especially so in small towns and villages. If they are given a cheque by a charity they will go to the local shop to cash it. It is not just a question of banks not being especially confidential at times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue the point. However, as my local charity has just been faced with a brand new charge from the local bank which we cannot understand I am not sure that I share the optimism that has just been expressed. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 10:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 4, line 1, after ("charity") insert ("having a gross income in its previous financial year which exceeds £10,000,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The principle of this amendment is very much along the lines of the principle we discussed on the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. Is it seriously suggested, as it is in new Section 4A (3), that the trustee of a charity with an income of £1,001 a year who signs a cheque which does not show on it the fact that it is for a registered charity,
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding the third level on the standard scale"?</p></blockquote>
That is nonsense. With the greatest respect, I can see arguments for imposing criminal penalties in relation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
to some trustee offences but to have it in the comprehensive and sweeping form as appears in subsection (3) is unsupportable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do we do about it? The Woodfield Committee said that there should be no criminal penalty for trust administration default, if I may put it in that rather neutral way. That may be going a little too far for the Government. On the other hand, I feel that one should limit the number of charities to which these criminal penalties should apply. We should take the division which the Government themselves have taken in Clause 21(3) with regard to accounting obligations. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a charity's gross income in any financial year does not exceed £10,000, the charity trustees may, in respect of that year, elect to prepare"</p></blockquote>
a receipts and payments account, as opposed to having proper accounts prepared by a professional. The Government themselves have chosen that division. If that is the division they perceive between those charities which should attract the whole obligation of the rest of the Bill and some of the criminal penalties thereunder, I do not see why that division should not also be imported back into subsection (3). That would make it a criminal offence if the charity's income is more than £10,000 a year and a trustee is in default; but, on the other hand, if the charity has an income of less than £10,000 a year, which most small charities do, it would cease to be a criminal offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, the purpose of this clause is to alert people who see or handle any of the documents referred to, especially people who are being asked to give money to the charity, that they are produced by a body which is a registered charity. Where the statement appears it will immediately tell people that details about the body are to be found in the central register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me just as important that this fact should be made known in the case of a small charity as well as a larger one—perhaps more important in the case of a small charity since fewer people will have heard of the charity to begin with. It follows, therefore, that trustees of small charities who fail to make arrangements for the documents to bear the statement should be treated in the same way as those of larger charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perhaps true to say, however, that the smaller the charity, the less likely it is to issue such things as bills of exchange or promissory notes, so the range of documents required to bear the statement will in practice be smaller for a smaller charity. We do not in any case believe that the requirement will be at all onerous or costly. Sufficient time will be given before the clause is brought into force for existing stocks of the various documents to be exhausted, and new ones bearing the required statement ordered. Many charities already put the statement on the majority of their documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have nevertheless deliberately refrained from extending the range of documents to include all letters written in the normal course of administering a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

charity, because we are aware that that might impose extra burdens on some charities, particularly those smaller ones which do not have printed writing paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the offence, any trustee who can show that he took all reasonable precautions to avoid commission of the offence will have a defence, and prosecutions cannot in any event be commence without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is no danger in our view of trustees being prosecuted willy-nilly for a default under Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment in its present form is in any event inappropriate as it merely exempts the trustees of any charity from prosecution in respect of any breach of duty imposed by Clause 4. It is highly unsatisfactory to have a duty which cannot be enforced. If Members of the Committee took the view that small registered charities should be exempt from this requirement, the correct course would be to exclude them from the duty imposed by subsection (1). I hope that I have explained clearly to the Committee why we feel it important that this information should be on the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Viscount says that this requirement would not be particularly onerous. He must recognise, as has been stated repeatedly, that we are now creating criminal offences which will apply to a whole range of offences. We are talking about charity funds of an almost derisory level. It seems to me to be extremely heavy handed for us to insist that the smallest charities in this country will have the law applied in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few moments ago the noble Viscount said that the Government are being consistent. I can see no case for consistency in this regard. We are talking about funds of, for example, £1,500 or £2,000. We are saying that in the event of a failure by a trust to observe paragraphs 4A(1) (a), (b) and (c), it will commit a crime. That seems to me to be out of all proportion. There is no benefit to be secured by this and I hope that the Government will think the better of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Richard and Lord Harris of Greenwich. If one is associated, as I am, with a new trust fund which will start by having an income of less than £10,000, it is rather important that the people putting it together view the matter as of equal importance as somebody who is starting a charity raising millions of pounds. The fact that there is a criminal factor is equally important for a small charity which is being run by people who are not as expert. They should take their responsibilities equally seriously. That is what we are talking about. It is not onerous if one is raising small funds to put that one is working for a registered charity on the writing paper, and so on. Every charity should have to do that. If it is fair for one charity to be subject to criminal justice, it is fair for the other. The Government are right about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, said that we are not just talking about putting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
"registered charity" on the writing paper. That is exactly what we are talking about. I refer the noble Lord to the clause which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a charity is a registered charity, the fact that is a registered charity shall be stated in English in legible characters".</p></blockquote>
It then states where it must be stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in all notices, advertisements and other documents issued by or on behalf of the charity and soliciting money or other property … in all bills of exchange, promissory notes, endorsements, cheques and orders for money or goods purporting to be signed on behalf of the charity".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that is meant to be as comprehensive as it sounds. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in all bills rendered by it and in all its invoices, receipts and letters of credit".</p></blockquote>
If that is not done, it is in relation to that obligation that the criminal penalty arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every charity trustee of the charity shall be guilty of an offence".</p></blockquote>
That imposes an edifice of obligation and criminal penalty which is totally inappropriate for the smaller charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Viscount says that we should have tried to exclude small charities from the imposition of the duties. That may be so. Judging by the reception received on the last amendment, we should not have got very far. As regards prosecution, I do not see why they should not be exempt. It is not good enough for the noble Viscount to say that the matter is in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Whether or not prosecuted, every trustee will have committed an offence. That cannot be right in relation to some of the smaller charities in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the noble Lord. He has not interpreted what I am saying. I am saying that if it is fair for trustees of large charities to be subject to criminal justice, it is equally fair for trustees of small charities. One cannot make a distinction at a turnover of £10,000 per year. It is right and proper that everybody must comply with what I consider to be a minimal need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, appears to say (I recognise there may be a failure on my part to understand) that there is no difference between one of the largest charities in the country—for example, Age Concern or the Royal National Lifeboat Institution—and all their teams of professional advisers and a trust which may be associated with, for example, the local cricket club which may have a turnover of £1,500 and no resources to obtain advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will make every trustee of that small cricket club at risk of committing a criminal offence if there is a failure to observe the first part of the proposed new clause. That seems to be wholly unreasonable and oppressive. Quite apart from anything else, once potential trustees realise the risk in which they are putting themselves, not only here but elsewhere in the Bill, it will be far more difficult to recruit trustees in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what we are concerned with in this amendment. We are concerned about whether a trustee should be criminally responsible if he does not state the fact that the charity is a registered charity on the piece of paper which he sends to the local store when ordering the bread and fillings for the local cricket club's sandwiches. I do not know whether the noble Lord considers that to be looking after other people's money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Richard. Trustees have a responsibility to donors who want to know that they are giving to a proper, registered charity. Also, when purchasing goods a charity, no matter whether it is large or small, will use the fact that it is a charity to obtain a form of discount or, very often, to obtain the goods for nothing. Therefore, it is important that the suppliers of goods should know whether a charity is registered and, therefore, likely to be properly run and the goods properly used for charitable purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I do not know what are the views of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, about cricket, but cricket is not a charity. That is important. Indeed, the smallest charities are exempt from the need to register. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friends Lord Mottistone and Lord Swinfen are right when they say that trustees have a duty. Before becoming a trustee a person should be aware of that duty. People dealing with a charity should know that. The charity should have no hesitation in saying what it is. If it is not a legal obligation, that will not have to be done. We are trying to be consistent. We are not imposing any obligation which, for example, directors of a very small company would not have. Small and large companies have the same obligations under the law as regards how the business must be run, and so on. I believe that we are being reasonable in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak for only a moment. What the noble Viscount said rather reinforces my feelings about the last amendment. For example, if my small charity meets and decides to give £150 to an individual in the village to buy a special form of bedding, and the treasurer when writing the cheque forgets to insert the name of the charity, as trustees we would be committing a criminal offence. I find that rather hard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat that if a small charity is writing out cheques it should be easy for the person writing the cheque to write on it that it is a charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the point. The point was that if the treasurer forgets, then he places all the trustees in trouble. Subsection (4) is not an answer. Taking the point referred to by the noble

In the circumstances, I do not propose to press the amendment at this stage. But the noble Viscount and the Government are wrong. I suspect that the Committee will not support me and discretion is perhaps the better part of valour at the moment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Aberdare)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is that Clause 4 shall stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief point. I hope Members of the Committee do not think it is too small a point. It arises from the side note to Clause 4. Admittedly side notes are not part of the law and Members of both Houses of Parliament have no responsibility for them. They are left entirely to officials and printers. However, I am afraid that this specific side note is not accurate, or at any rate could be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The side note refers to a registered charity's status which is to appear on official publications. From discussions we have had and from reading the clauses, we are aware that the "status" is that of a registered charity. However, many lay people, especially dealing with small charities, may scratch their heads and ask, "What is the status of our registered charity? Is it educational, religious, for the relief of poverty, or what?". All kinds of things may enter their heads, whereas what the clause is concerned with is merely the fact that it is a registered charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Clause 4 would do better to say that the registered charity's name should appear on official publications; that is indeed what the clause actually says. In support of my suggestion perhaps I may invite noble Lords to turn to the next clause in the Bill which deals with the name of the registered charity. It is the name which is the relevant point. Therefore it is not a matter which could be the subject of an amendment, because by custom we have no control over the side notes. However, I felt that in conscience I should mention the point in the hope that those responsible would consider it. It would be better simply to say, "Registered charity's name to appear on office publications".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my noble friend's anxiety. He is quite correct when he says that we do not amend the side headings. They are not part of the Bill. They merely direct people's attention to that part of the Bill to which they refer. "Status" appears in the side heading as shorthand to refer to the fact that the charity is a registered charity. There may be many different ways of referring to Clause 4, and no doubt those who write side headings will take note of what my noble friend has said. However, whether it will be changed or not is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe we are mistakenly talking to Clause 4 stand part. The Lord Chairman has been

misled by the Marshalled List. If I am correct, Amendments Nos. 10A to 10D in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, refer to Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Aberdare)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord is correct and the Marshalled List is wrong. We should not debate Clause 4 stand part until after Amendment No. 10D. We listened with interest to what was said by my noble friend Lord Renton, but perhaps we could now move to Amendment No. 10A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 10A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 4, line 4, after ("charity") insert ("who has been responsible for or privy to such act or default").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: On behalf of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, I invite the Committee's attention to Amendment No. 10A, which is grouped with Amendments Nos. 10A to 10D. As before, I do so formally to give the Government the opportunity of expressing any views that they may have on the matter. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this group of amendments. In larger charities the charity trustees determine the general policy of a charity; they are not responsible for the day-to-day running of the charity. It is the paid officers of the charity who are responsible for that. I admit that they are responsible to the trustees, but as the Bill is drafted it is the trustees who get in trouble for the everyday and expected work of the officials of the charity. It is something which needs to be considered and is a misunderstanding of the way in which larger charities not only operate but need to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision to be introduced by Clause 4 provides an important new duty on trustees of registered charities; that is, to ensure that certain types of document issued by or on behalf of their charity include a statement that the charity is so registered. I make no apology for saying that again because it is crucial to Clause 4. It will represent a signal that the charity in question is subject to the supervision of the commissioners. It will also signal to those entering into business or legal transaction with the charity that particular legal considerations apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is therefore important and it is right that there should be an effective sanction for non-compliance. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, is however anxious about the wording of the existing offence and has offered an alternative form of words. In my view the noble and learned Lord's amendments would restrict the offence to only those trustees responsible for or privy to the facts. How are the courts to tell whether a particular trustee is responsible for, or indeed privy to, a default which may consist of the omission of the required statement from a particular invoice issued by the charity? It seems to me to present an impossible task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me to be right that the law should treat trustees as collectively responsible for defaults in respect of their statutory duties. In that way trustees will be encouraged to establish a regime where any document issued by the registered charity soliciting money or other property states the fact that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
charity is registered. However, a defence is provided by subsection (4) in respect of a trustee who can show that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence. In this way the new provision will not punish trustees when they have done all they can to ensure that the law is complied with. However, it does have the procedure proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. These amendments are not far reaching and are an attempt, by altering the drafting, to pinpoint the responsibility more clearly. I have no doubt that the noble and learned Lord will consider what my noble friend Lord Astor has said.

	<br><blockquote><p>Page 4, line 29, at end insert ("that exists or has ceased to exist").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a small amendment, but it is a necessary one. A great deal of care has been taken in drafting the Bill to ensure that the public are not duped or angered by a registered name and that names are not used as a vehicle for misrepresentation in other ways. The powers to blackball a name I believe to be appropriate. In passing, I wonder whether a reason for blackballing has to be given to an applicant. Such a requirement would be helpful. I believe that the commission should also have powers to blackball look-alike names if they appear in the image of charities that have ceased to exist. In the eyes of the commission a name vanishes if it has been discarded from the register and is no longer recorded anywhere in its books. It may therefore escape consideration as a look-alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Second Reading I mentioned the case of Barnardos, which now has a protected name. But the name of Dr. T.J. Barnardo and his East End juvenile mission may now be open to exploitation by a new name and trustees who wish to ride on his reputation. He did have other things in the East End such as coffee palaces, and so on, which were perhaps not charitable. Nevertheless, he had a reputation there and that is perhaps what needs to be protected in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I feel that the commission should have powers to consider look-alike names from the past so that some protection can be given to existing charities who may have ancestral connections; for example, names which are no longer legal entities but which have a distinct image in history and society. I hope that the wording of my amendment will achieve that purpose. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the motivation of my noble friend Lord Ironside in putting down this amendment. I do not think it is practicable or

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
necessary to allow the commissioners to prevent a charity using a name which was formerly held by another charity, but which charity has ceased to exist. Company names are subject under the Companies Act 1985 to a similar regime as that proposed here. There is no provision in company law to prevent the use of a former company's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that a charity with a particular name should enjoy a measure of protection against others who wish to use that name. But where a charity wishes to use a name which belongs to no other charity there is, therefore, no other charity which can therefore be protected by forbidding the use of that name. The fact that at one time the name belonged to a charity which no longer exists should not be a material consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the charity has ceased to exist there is no reason why its name should not be returned to the public domain. Where a charity wishes to use the former name of an existing charity (my noble friend gave the example of Dr.Barnardo) the noble Lord's amendment would have no effect. The solution for a charity which might now be called, for example, Barnardos, would be to allege similarity and for the commissioners to use their power under Clause 5(2) (a) (ii) in order to require a change of name. So where there is a similarity the commissioners have the power to use their discretion under that clause. To say that no other name could be used once it has been in the public domain, even though that charity no longer exists, would not be reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that a nation which manages the registration of its thoroughbred racehorses with such immense accuracy and skill should at least be able to get its charities into as good a condition. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Astor, with his great experience, agrees with that proposition. If the name of a racehorse is to be used again because the horse has passed way, the procedure is rather similar to the one used for the monarchy. The numbers I, II and III are used. I do not believe that that solution would apply well in the case of charities. The kind of flexibility which my noble friend Lord Ferrers has described is probably the best way of dealing with the matter. With respect to my noble friend Lord Ironside, I would not expect him to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Ironside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point which my noble friend has made that where a charity wishes to use one of the names previously used at some time, it can do so. I was making the point that if a new charity comes along which wishes to ride on the past reputation of another charity that situation needs to be considered. However, I imagine that the Charity Commissioners are sensible people and will look at this point with compassion and that they will entertain appeals from other charities if they believe that a name from the past is being misused. I accept what my noble friend said, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 5 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 6 agreed to.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
	<p>Clause 7 [	<i>General power to institute inquiries</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 12:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 6, line 11, leave out subsection (5) and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(5) For subsection (7) there shall be substituted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) Where an inquiry has been held under this section the Commissioners may either—
	<ol>
	<li>cause the report of the person conducting the inquiry, or such other statement of the results of the inquiry as they think fit, to be printed and published, or</li>
	<li>publish any such report or statement in some other way which is calculated in their opinion to bring it to the attention of persons who may wish to make representations to them about the action to be taken." ").</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord said: This is a Keeling type of amendment in a small way. It arises out of Clause 7 of the Bill which amends Section 60 of the 1960 Act giving the commissioners power to institute inquiries. I ask the Committee to read subsection (5) on page 6 of the Bill, at line 11. What is proposed reads as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In subsection (7)—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a)for the words from 'the Commissioners' to 'may publish' there shall be substituted 'an inquiry has been held under this section, the Commissioners may either -</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a)cause'; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b)for 'in any manner' there shall be substituted `to be printed and published, or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b)publish any such report or statement in some other way which his'".</p></blockquote>
That takes up nine lines, and as Members of the Committee will see, if they have tried, it is a puzzle to work out. With just one more line the whole thing can be made crystal clear. Perhaps I may ask the Committee to refer to the amendment, which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an inquiry has been held under this section the Commissioners may either—
	<ol>
	<li>cause the report of the person conducting the inquiry, or such other statement of the results of the inquiry as they think fit, to be printed and published, or</li>
	<li>publish any such report or statement in some other way which is calculated in their opinion to bring it to the attention of persons who may wish to make representations to them about the action to be taken".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is one more line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question before the Committee is: which wording will be more user friendly—subsection (5) as printed, which has to be woven into Section 6 of the 1960 Act before it can be understood, or my amendment, which requires no weaving, is as clear as daylight and occupies only one more line of print?

	<p>Clause 7, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 8 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a matter that I have raised in almost every speech that I have made about charities, and it relates to the power of the Charity Commissioners to take care that money left to charities reaches them. There are two forms of bequest to charities. One may specify the charity that is to have the money and the other may leave more general directions about the disposal of the money for charitable purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficulties can arise in both cases. Not being a lawyer but merely what the BBC once described as an informed layman, and having a certain competence to broadcast on difficult matters, I have studied this subject and have broadcast on it at different times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter that I wish to raise relates to how the Charity Commissioners safeguard a charity by obtaining information about the content of wills which provide for certain moneys to reach a charitable destination. Clause 8 refers to "any person". They can get to know someone who might have information. I presume that the Charity Commissioners could then ask them to furnish that information. But, for example, what does one do about the case of the residue of an estate left for charitable purposes, preferably for the benefit of the advancement and training of the young, but indicating that nothing in what has been said must hamper the sole discretion of two trustees as to the disposal of the residue for charitable purposes? What can the Charity Commissioners do about that? They have no knowledge of the matter. There is presumably no statutory requirement on the executors to inform the Charity Commissioners. If they like to give money to a particular charity, they are free to do so, and it comes out of the blue to the charity when it receives it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am probably trespassing on the law of wills, and that may be my difficulty. There are probably three sets of legislation in existence that may come into operation in any particular case. We are dealing with the law on charities, but the law on trusts and the law on wills are involved here. Let me take a hypothetical case of two trustees, both solicitors, who are entrusted with the execution of a will which one of them has already drawn up. The residue of the estate is to be distributed for charitable purposes. The charity may have been formed by the deceased person with only £100. It was registered as a charity with wide terms of references, with two trustees, both solicitors, and with £100 from the benefactor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees then decide that they have their own ideas as to how the residue of the estate which they are handling should be used. That can go on for quite a time. They then decide that in order to avoid paying tax on the interest received while the residue is in their hands and not devoted to charitable purposes they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
had better do something to help the charity. So they transfer a whole batch of investments to the trustees of the charity, one of whom is trustee of the estate. That loan from the residue to the charity stays long enough with the charity for it to draw the dividend. The well-known process of dividend-stripping comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charity receiving the dividends, less tax, is entitled to recover the tax from the Inland Revenue. Then the money goes back to the trustees who lent it, and they wait for another batch of investments to go across so that they can do the same thing. The charity that was created before the death of the benefactor benefits to the extent that tax deducted from dividends while in its possession is refunded to it. That can go on for quite a time. I am not talking about a few pounds; I am talking about millions. The amount of money going to the charity was obviously a large one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into some other aspects of a possible operation of this kind, except to refer in passing to the change in the value of the shares while in the hands of the charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is, how do the Charity Commissioners learn about such cases? How can they keep an eye on matters? Whose job is it to see that wills of that kind are properly executed? It is perfectly legal and it may be that it is perfectly proper, but it is a transaction which might be queried. When money is left to charities, or to charity, with no named destination, the Charity Commissioners ought to have some interest in how the matter is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of those charities which are named I understand that it is up to them to find that out. If they do not know about the legacy, the Charity Commissioners are unable to do anything. It may be that there is a delay on the part of the trustees. Therefore, I do not believe that two trustees (and certainly not two professional trustees who can charge fees) should ever be enough. Charities cannot be properly protected and the Charity Commissioners remain helpless so long as the conditions which I have described prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that I am wrong in raising this issue under Clause 8, but the clause deals with the powers of the commissioners to obtain information. However, it only enables them to look where they think the information is to be found. It does not give them power to require those who have information to disclose it. That is a weakness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the observations I have made in the course of an earlier debate on charities when I mentioned the subject have been taken up and considered. It seems to me that in a combination of circumstances in such cases there should be some power of oversight over what is being done with a substantial residue of an estate in which the testator, who ought to have been better advised, left a substantial sum in the hands of trustees. In the case I mentioned it was not until five years after the death of the testator that the residue was turned into a new charitable trust. Now there is a charity and a charitable trust, both relating to the same estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such activities are puzzling, if not disturbing. I therefore ask whether Clause 8 will be adequate,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
whether it will be open to fresh consideration to enlarge the powers of the commissioners or whether that would have to be done in another Act of Parliament so that those who are trustees of such estates and such bequests are required to disclose them to the Charity Commissioners. The Inland Revenue learns about the background to such transactions and might be given powers to communicate with the Charity Commissioners. But in dealing with a Bill of this kind we do not have within our grasp all the circumstances relating to a particular trust and the circumstances in which money is entrusted to other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the noble Earl indicate how the problem might be dealt with? If not in Clause 8, where should it be dealt with? Is it within this Bill at all? I certainly believe that there is a matter requiring consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Perhaps I may raise another point in this debate on whether Clause 8 should stand part of the Bill and ask the Minister a question as to the enforceability of orders made under Clause 8. As I understand it, Clause 8 of the Bill amends Section 7 of the Charities Act 1960. Under the 1960 Charities Act an order may be made by the commissioner requiring any person having in his possession or control any books to furnish the information. That is enforceable by Section 41 of the Charities Act 1960, which states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person guilty of disobedience … to an order of the Commissioners under … section seven"—</p></blockquote>
which is the subsection which Clause 8 amends—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may on the application of the Commissioners to the High Court be dealt with as for disobedience to an order of the High Court".</p></blockquote>
That is presumably through the contempt procedure. I see nodding from the anonymous back row so the Minister will be pleased to know that at least those behind him agree with what I have said so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a disadvantage. I am not like a chameleon with eyes at the back of my head and cannot see the genuflections or gesticulations which the noble Lord sees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I tried to help the noble Earl by telling him. It was no genuflection; it was a gentle nod of assent which I was delighted to see from someone so qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question is whether that is still enforceable by that contempt procedure, which would mean that the commission would have to go to the High Court. I do not know what form the proceedings would take to ask for an order under the contempt procedures of the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the application to the High Court have to be made on the initiative of the commissioner alone or does it have to go to someone else? Secondly, what happens in the case of an appeal made by the commissioners under this section relating to the production of documents? If someone says they do not have the documents and do not think they ought to produce them, is there a system of appeal? Such an appeal appeared to be indicated under Section 41 of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
the old Act and I am not sure whether that would still apply under the Bill. If the noble Earl could answer those questions I should be greatly obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, has given us a very interesting discourse on a complicated subject. I shall do my best to answer him as briefly as possible. The matters he raised are detailed. I should like to consider them and perhaps write a comprehensive letter to him giving a detailed explanation of the matters to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord was concerned how money which people leave in trust will get to the people it has been left to. The Charity Commissioners can only find out about such bequests after probate has been granted. They then use the services of an agency which looks at all wills. That should put them into the picture with regard to what has been left to charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a commercial probate agency which will examine every will to which probate is granted for estates above £5,000. It undertakes to inform any charity which is mentioned, for a modest fee. If a charity believes money may have been left to it, it can have recourse to that agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, said that there is no power for those who have the information about what may be left to charities to disclose it. Both solicitors and executives of wills frequently ask the Charity Commissioners for details of charities which have been left money in wills in order that they may trace the trustees concerned and give them the money. Failure to comply with an order of the Charity Commission to give information is in fact punishable. To do so is contempt of court. That comes under Section 41 of the 1960 Act. The commissioners can require the disclosure of information by order under Clause 8(1) and disobedience to an order is punishable as contempt of court under Section 41 of the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Richard, asked whether it is necessary to have the Attorney-General's consent. The Charity Commissioners need the Attorney-General's consent for legal proceedings by virtue of Clause 29. The noble Lord also asked whether it was necessary for people to go to the High Court for contempt proceedings. The answer is that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 8 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 9 [	<i>Power to act for protection of charities</i>]:</p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 13:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 7, line 21, at end insert ("with regard being had to the nature and purpose of the charity;.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I have no problem with the proposal in the clause to take a power to appoint additional trustees to a charity in the case where there is need to protect charities' assets. Indeed, I welcome it. But the power is quite large and I am seeking some assurance that the commissioners will seek to appoint trustees with some understanding, knowledge and experience of the nature and circumstances of the charity concerned. I should like to see something in the statute itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
The purpose of the amendment is simply to write in some safeguard against the possibility, however remote it might be, of the commissioners appointing trustees who were not in sympathy with the charity's objects and ethos. Without those words there is nothing to stop them. There is a good deal of feeling about this and I very much hope that the Government will feel able to agree to it. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to ensure that the commissioners do not appoint additional trustees who are in some way incompatible with the nature or purposes of the charity. In exercising the power to appoint additional trustees, the commissioners would, as a matter of course, wish to appoint trustees whom they felt were best able to ensure the proper administration of the charity in question. Where the nature and purposes of the charity have a bearing on this qualification—and religious charities are a good example of this—the commissioners would always have regard to them. In a like way, where the nature of the charity—for example, its size—has a bearing on the number of additional trustees to be appointed, the commissioners would have regard to that. They would not, for example, appoint an excessively large number of additional trustees to a small charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the commissioners exercise a discretion in the making of an order under Section 20 of the 1960 Act, they must do so in the light of all the circumstances. It would be wrong to curtail them by reference to one factor alone. I am quite happy to consider the noble Lord's suggestion for the future, but at the moment we are of the opinion that it would be better not to draw attention to one specific factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that reply half satisfactory, but only half. I cannot see the point of this being one specific factor. The words are in fairly general terms. Although the noble Earl said that the commissioners would do this, that and the other, there is nothing in the statute to stop them doing something different. I should like to have seen this written into the Bill. However, if the noble Earl will think about it again before the next stage, I shall do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall think about it again. I do not think there is anything objectionable in the words. It is merely a question of whether they are necessary. It seems to us that that is what the Charity Commissioners would do. I shall certainly consider the point further to see whether it would be a good thing to put in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am of a most trusting nature. I shall not pursue the point today. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 13A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 8, line 37, leave out (" "make provision" ") and insert (" "the suspension" ").</p></blockquote>
The noble Viscount said: In moving this amendment perhaps I may speak also to Amendment No. 13B. These amendments merely clarify what is meant by the amended subsection (8) of Section 20. That subsection deals with orders of suspension which may be made by the Charity Commissioners under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
Section 20(1) (i) if the 1960 Act. It enables consequential provision to be made in the order with regard to the period of suspension. These amendments make it clear that such provision is made in relation to a person who has been suspended so that, for example, another person may be authorised to do things in his name and act on his behalf. Without these amendments it is not entirely clear in whose name or on whose behalf such matters are being undertaken. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under Section 20(8) of the 1960 Act the maximum period of time for which a trustee could be suspended was three months. In the amendment moved by the noble Viscount that period rises from three months to 12 months. What is the justification for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give an immediate answer. Perhaps I may write to the noble Lord to explain the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 14:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 9, line 15, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(10) Section 20 of the 1960 Act, as amended by this section, and with the omission of repealed provisions, is set out in Schedule 	<i>(Section 20 of the 1960 Act as amended)</i> to this Act.").</p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord said: I fear that Members of the Committee will believe that I have a one-track mind. Again, this is a Keeling type of amendment. I have spoken already to this amendment. Section 20 is extremely important. It has three pages of print setting out powers conferred on the Charity Commissioners to enable them to protect charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 amends and adds to those powers. It covers 2½ pages of print. Seven of the existing subsections are amended and new subsections are added, some by way of addition and some by way of substitution. As Section 20 of the 1960 Act is such an important section, I suggest, as I did before, that it would be a great service to the public if the amended Section 20 could be set out in a Keeling schedule so that the reader does not have to cope with a patchwork of cross-references. All that is needed is Amendment No. 14. Amendment No. 112 comprises the section in question set out in 2½ pages with the amendments shown in bold type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Earl said that he would consider the amendment sympathetically. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has done a great service in taking the trouble, which he has, to put forward the section which we have been discussing into a Keeling schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting point is that even with the amendments proposed by the Government, and when the Keeling schedule has finally been disposed of, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
substitution of Section 20 of the 1960 Act will be slightly shorter than the original Section 20. That is a matter for satisfaction, and I believe that the Government should be glad for everyone to see and to know that. Keeling schedules should be used sparingly, in my opinion, but there is a case for them and this is an example where it is extremely helpful to have one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point I wish to add is that Clause 9 is in the Bill and was intended to remain as a clause. However, eventually, its proper place would be in a schedule. It is long and detailed and although important, it is somewhat administrative. Essentially, it gives powers to the Charity Commissioners rather than injunctions to the citizen. It is a matter of judgment but in my judgment the noble and learned Lord is right. I hope that my noble friend, on behalf of the Government, and Members of the Committee will support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, as was my noble friend Lord Renton, to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman for having taken the trouble to produce the amendment. We are speaking to Amendment No. 14 and also to Amendment No. 112, which puts the matter in the form of a schedule. That answers the point about which my noble friend Lord Renton was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend said also that he believes that Keeling schedules should be used sparingly but that there is a case for them. He is right that they should be used sparingly but this is an extremely important clause and it is important that people should know what it means. I am anxious that my noble friend Lord Peyton should not still believe that the Government are being deplorable and am even more anxious to inform the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, that we believe his amendment is a great improvement to the Bill. I am happy to accept the amendment and I invite Members of the Committee to do likewise.

I refer to Amendment No. 112A standing in my name because that amends Amendment No. 112. That amendment is consequential on Amendments Nos. 13A and 13B, which the Committee has agreed.

The noble Lord said: I formally move the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. I do not wish to commit myself to the merits of the amendment because it is far reaching in its effect. However, it is a matter on which the Government may wish to express their views. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the new Section 20, the Charity Commissioners can appoint a receiver and manager where the administration of a charity has completely broken down or where its property is at risk. Regulations made under subsection (6) may make a provision which governs the appointment of receivers and managers, their remuneration from the income of the charity and their reports to the commissioners. The purpose of paragraph (7) of new subsection (20A), which this amendment removes, is to specify particular actions which regulations may authorise the commissioners to take. There are three: first, to require security from a receiver and manager for due discharge of his functions; secondly, to set the level of remuneration of a receiver and manager; and thirdly, to disallow any part of that remuneration in circumstances which may be specified in the regulations.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a reason for that but at the moment it escapes me. If it meets with the approval of the noble Lord perhaps I can ferret out the matter and advise him of the reason before the next stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of interfering with the noble Earl's ferreting. I am bound to say that it raises interesting possibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer arises in a later clause of the Bill—but I would not presume to have wisdom of where my noble friend chains it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to express gratitude to my noble friend. This is the kind of detailed matter which can be left to regulations and need not be incorporated in the Bill. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, will no doubt wish to consider the position. In the meantime I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clauses 11 to 18 agreed to. Clause 19 [	<i>Dormant bank accounts of charities</i>]:</p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 15:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Page 17, line 43, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>("(5A) If future income arising from an investment or other property belonging to the relevant charity would be payable into a dormant account in respect to which a direction has been made under subsection (2) and has not been revoked under subsection (5) the Commissioners may make an order vesting that property in the charity or one of the charities specified in the direction so made under subsection (2).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5B) The Commissioners shall not make such an order unless they have received from the charity trustees of the charity in whom such property is proposed to be vested written confirmation that those trustees are willing to accept such property.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5C) Property vested in a charity by virtue of subsection (5A) and the future income thereof shall be held and applied in the manner specified in subsection (4).").</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The noble and learned Lord said: Amendment No. 15 relates to dormant funds. Clause 19 does a splendid job by enabling the commissioners to direct a bank or building society to transfer to an active charity the amounts standing to the credit of the bank account of a dormant charity.</p>
	<p>However, what happens to the capital that produces the income that is lying dormant? Is that capital to continue producing income which is then paid into the dormant account, so that a new direction must be given to the Charity Commissioners every year? Amendment No. 15 seeks to meet the problem by enabling the Charity Commissioners to divert the capital into the hands of the same active charity. The dormant bank or building society account can then be closed.</p>
	<p>Perhaps I may read the three proposed subsections from Amendment No. 15:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) If future income arising from an investment or other property belonging to the relevant charity would be payable into a dormant account in respect to which a direction has been made under subsection (2) and has not been revoked under subsection (5) the Commissioners may make an order vesting that property in the charity or one of the charities specified in the direction so made under subsection (2).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5B) The Commissioners shall not make such an order unless they have received from the charity trustees of the charity in whom such property is proposed to be vested written confirmation that those trustees are willing to accept such property.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5C) Property vested in a charity by virtue of subsection (5A) and the future income thereof shall be held and applied in the manner specified in subsection (4)".</p></blockquote>
All that means is that the dormant capital follows the dormant income into the hands of an active charity. I beg to move.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the intention behind the amendment of the noble and learned Lord. He is anxious about income which would have been paid into a dormant account had that account not been closed and its contents vested by direction of the commissioners into another charity. I agree that such income and the investment or property from which it is derived should be directed to an active charity, and therefore put to good use. The only difference between the noble and learned Lord and myself—it is a modest one—is the way in which that should be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a situation best dealt with by an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
amendment to Clause 19. If the income is due to be paid into an account which is dormant in the circumstances described and the bank concerned informs the commissioners of the receipt of that income, or they find out about it in any other way, the commissioners, with their powers under Section 18 of the 1960 Act, as amended by Clause 14 of the Bill, will be able to provide a scheme to vest in another charity the property from which that income was derived. That will enable it to be used for the purposes of that charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the income from the property exceed £500 a year, the commissioners will appoint trustees to apply for such a scheme. If it were less than £500, they would rely on an application for a scheme from an interested person. Those are the steps commissioners will take to deal with property belonging to any charity which has no trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say that I cannot imagine the commissioners needing to take either of those steps very often. For an account to be dormant for the purposes of Clause 19 it must have received no income for at least five years. I cannot think of many types of property or investment which pay income at such extended intervals. Should the commissioners be required to take any of the steps I have mentioned, they should have regard to the purposes for which the property was originally held. They would not vest the property in another charity without the consent of the trustees of that charity. I hope that I have been able to explain the position and to take the noble and learned Lord with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering whether the noble Earl has quite met my point. Perhaps I can take a concrete example. Suppose there is a dormant charity which holds £1,000 consols and £50 has been paid quarterly into the dormant bank account for the appropriate five years. That income will continue being paid into that account quarter by quarter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that under Clause 19 the Charity Commissioners will be able to give a direction which will pass over to an active charity the income which is then standing in that account. But when the next quarter comes along another lot of income will be paid into the dormant account. As I understand Clause 19, the money can only come out again if another order is made under that clause. I am seeking to transfer the £1,000 of consols to an active charity so that it can be properly dealt with. No doubt it will be invested in something more productive and the dormant account can be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the matter may be dealt with by way of a scheme under Section 18 of the 1960 Act, but that is a more cumbersome process. My suggestion is a simple one enabling everything to be done at once, coping with the income in the dormant account and the capital producing that dormant income. That can be done all in one go instead of one needing to go back to the Charity Commissioners to obtain a scheme sealed under the appropriate Section 18 of the 1960 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is only one point on which a difficulty arises. The noble and learned Lord refers to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
money being paid from consols into a dormant account. But the account would not be dormant if it was in receipt of funds. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord will address himself to page 18 of the Bill. Clause 19(8) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section—
(a)an account is dormant if no transaction … has been effected within the period of five years".</p></blockquote>
If the account is in receipt of funds it is not dormant. There are powers for the commissioners to transfer those funds from a non-dormant account of a charity which is no longer making use of them. They have that power already under other provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the noble Earl, Clause 19(8) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an account is dormant if no transaction (other than one that the institution holding the account has itself caused to be effected)".</p></blockquote>
The institution holding the account causes the income to be paid into the dormant account. The mere receipt of income does not prevent the account being dormant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tremble to disagree with the noble and learned Lord, but as I read that passage the institution holding the account refers to the bank. In other words, it is the bank which is holding the account which is supposed to be dormant. If that is right and there are payments into that bank account, then it would not be dormant within the terms of the section. I may be wrong. Perhaps I may ask the Minister this because it follows my reading of the subsection and the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(other than one that the institution holding the account has itself caused to be effected)".</p></blockquote>
I assume that refers to bank interest. Where an account has money in it, that is obviously earning some interest from the bank. The bank is the institution that holds the account and if that interest is added to the amount in the account, that is specifically exempted from being a payment under subsection 8(a), as I read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the point sought to be made by the noble Lord is right then Clause 19 totally fails in what I had conceived to be its purpose. It would mean that that clause can never touch any charity account which holds property producing any income whatever because as soon as the property is producing income, according to that argument, the income, on being paid into the account, prevents the account from being dormant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of Clause 19 is that it covers any charitable fund which is not being dealt with in any way by the charity. If income is paid from the Bank of England into the bank account of the charity, the charity is doing nothing and the charity fund is clearly dormant. I do not want to detain the Committee, but if there is a dispute about this matter perhaps the noble Earl will give an assurance that he will look at Clause 19 to see whether there is merit in my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall look at what the noble and learned Lord has said. The only reason why I was anxious to jump to my feet when the noble Lord, Lord Richard, was speaking, was to just to say that I was so happy to be in agreement with the noble Lord. My understanding is that his interpretation is right. I hesitate to suggest that the noble and learned Lord's interpretation is wrong because that would be an impertinence. Of the two, I prefer the interpretation of the noble Lord, Lord Richard. The words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"other than one that the institution holding the account has itself caused to be effected"</p></blockquote>
are meant to refer, and do refer, to the banks. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, referred to interest that might be paid in. We might even find that bank charges are paid. I shall certainly look at the point. We have held discussions with the main banks and they would not treat an account as dormant if the income continues to flow into it and they could not readily identify any accounts of that sort. I shall look at the point and write to the noble and learned Lord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point seems to be of considerable importance. If the view of the Government and that of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is right, the operation of this clause is much narrower than most of us had supposed. In addition to looking at the interpretation one must ask the Government to consider the possibility of looking at its scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall look at everything that the Committee draws to our attention because we realise that this is quite a complicated area. As I have explained, we wish to get the Bill as right as possible. This particular part of the Bill is supposed only to deal with accounts which are dormant and into which no transactions have been entered. There would be a sum of money available which should be put to some use. That is the reasoning behind the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this provision is cribbed from the Scottish Act which has now been in force for some little time. Perhaps some inquiries may be made north of the Border to see whether any problems have arisen of the kind that we have been discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Earl and I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 19 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 20 [	<i>Duty to keep accounting records</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 16:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 18, line 31, leave out ("any") and insert ("that").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment is an attempt to remove what may be a restrictive burden on small charities. Many small charities may write up their books infrequently. The Bill as drafted, according to my understanding, means that the books have to be up to date on a daily basis. I doubt whether many business are up to date every day with all the transactions that have taken place that day. I am not seeking to reduce the responsibility of charities which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
produce their accounts, but the provision could be a burden on small charities which are managed by volunteers. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 20(1) places trustees under a duty to keep proper accounting records which are sufficient to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any particular point in time the charity's financial position. Charity trustees should be able to see how their finances stand at any given moment. My noble friend's amendment would create confusion, as it would be no longer clear by the substitution of the word "that" when the accounting records should be kept up to date in order to disclose the charity's financial position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. In looking at it one should also look at the following Amendment No. 17, at the same time because both are directed towards the same evil. The real question is the extent of the burden that one should legitimately place on small charities—I emphasise the word "small"—as far as the minutiae of their accounting is concerned. The noble Viscount said that the amendment would cause some confusion. The present clause also causes confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the clause mean that at any given moment in any particular day the accounts have to be up to date on that day, or does it mean that the small charity should have sufficient information on which, if it is called on to do so, it will be able to produce proper accounts as at that particular day? If it means the second, then I do not believe that there will be much difficulty with it. Obviously there would be the financial raw material from which any trustees, particularly the treasurer of the trust, should be able to say, for example, that from 31st January such-and-such is the position. The idea of keeping day to day running accounts is imposing too great a burden on the charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may correct one thing. I talked about the substitution of the word "that". That of course is the next point. I reiterate that the amendment would create confusion and it would no longer be clear when the accounting records would need to be sufficient to show and explain all the charity's transactions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Viscount is compounding his offence. The existing clause is unclear as to what it demands from charities. The amendment is only trying to achieve clarity. I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, would claim that his amendment would produce total clarity—it might not—but at least it indicates the type of confusion that the Government should be trying to clear up. For the noble Viscount merely to say that we are putting in "that" instead of "any" is no answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording is taken directly from Section 221(1) (a) of the Companies Act 1985. It has not proved to be confusing for large or small companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What do the Government want small charities to do? Do they want them to keep day-to-day
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
running accounts or do they want them to be able to produce proper accounting and a proper picture of the charity's financial state as and when they are called upon to provide them? If they want the second, I have to tell the noble Viscount that the clause is confused in the way it imposes that obligation. If they want the first, that seems reasonably clear. I hope that that is not what the Government want. They cannot expect small charities such as my Llangyfelach Cricket Club, with an income of £1,001, to keep day-to-day running accounts, as seems to be required by Clause 20(2), which the next amendment is designed to achieve. It removes the phrase "from day to day".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I have given way three times. If the noble Viscount wants to treat us like the other place, by all means let him do so, but on the whole we do not behave like it. At least I try not to. Sometimes it is a great strain not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will take the view that the burden on small charities should be that they should have the raw material necessary to produce an accurate picture of their financial state as and when they are called upon to do so. The clause does not achieve that. I hope that the Government will take it back and look at it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely rising to try to point out that I made the first mistake by referring to the words in the following amendment. I was merely trying to point out to the noble Lord, Lord Richard, that he was talking to the next amendment and not the amendment that has been moved. With great respect, he was talking about the phrase "from day to day", and that relates to the next amendment. I shall happily give the Committee an answer on the next amendment when it arises. I believe that I have explained that the wording of the amendment that we are discussing which requires disclosure at "any" time is the same as the provision in the Companies Act. It is not confusing. It is not meant to be confusing. We are going down a path that has been gone down before with the Companies Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could look at the position of the parish meeting which has a parish charity. On Wednesday it has its meeting. The chairman is a farmer. The farmer has to get up early the next morning so he obviously does not have time to do the accounts. His accounts are then demanded that afternoon. He obviously does not have them in order because he has not had time to do that. Furthermore, I am not sure that I understand the phrase "with reasonable accuracy". A figure is either accurate or it is inaccurate. I do not know what "reasonable accuracy" means. I am not sure that I understand the Bill and I should like some further explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to my noble friend, she referred to the following amendment as well as the amendment which has been moved with the example that she gave. Perhaps I could return to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
amendment that we are discussing and deal with the point about "reasonable accuracy". They are standard provisions contained in the Companies Act 1985. What the provisions mean is self-evident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I question whether it can be assumed that because something is written into the Companies Act 1985, which was not challenged at the time because people were thinking of small companies and not small charities, it is right for the Bill. There is a great difference between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the wording should be made much clearer so that the people who are required to act upon it understand it. To fall back on what happens to be in the Companies Act is irresponsible, if I can put it that way, on the part of the Government, because in that way they are not helping the people for whom they are trying to legislate. There is a great deal of room for improvement in the clause. I hope that the Government will undertake to take it away to see whether they can improve the wording to make it more sensible for the people who will be required to act upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to resume my natural alliance with the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone. What he has said is right. I find the constant references to the Companies Act thoroughly disturbing. I can understand why the Government have looked at the Companies Act in relation to the issues that we are discussing, but it is wholly inappropriate to talk about small charities in the same way as we talk about the obligation of directors of a small company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not start to introduce arguments which are more appropriate to the next amendment, but I believe that the Government's approach is mistaken. I hope that they will listen to what has been said and come back and satisfy the anxieties which have been expressed this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the words used are the same as those which relate to charities' accounts in the 1990 Scottish legislation. The Bill uses the same words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"disclose at any time, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the charity at that time".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not an amendment that I have dreamt up. It was one that I was asked to put down by the Charity Finance Directors Group. It has an idea of what is needed. I am not satisfied with what my noble friend the Minister has said. I hope that he and his advisers will look at the matter again. I shall look at it again. We must bear in mind—I hope that I do not stray into the next amendment—that charity income and expenditure does not have a nice regular flow. Charities have major appeals from time to time. They are major in comparison to the size of the charity. The appeal may bring in so many donations that the charity does not have the staff to deal with the bookkeeping aspects every day even though all the money is banked on that day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
This is a matter that should be reconsidered. The charities are happy with the ideas behind the Bill but they want to ensure that the Bill will work. I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 17:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 18, line 38, leave out ("from day to day").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I believe that I have already discussed the amendment, which obviously offended the noble Viscount's sense of order and propriety as to the way in which the Committee should conduct its business. For that, if for nothing else, I apologise to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not repeat what I said. The issue is simple. What are the obligations that the Government intend to put upon small charities? To talk about,
	<br><blockquote><p>"entries showing from day to day all sums of money received",</p></blockquote>
is going much too high. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the clarification which the amendment seeks. Over the past five years I have been involved in the chairmanship of two parishes with their parochial church councils. I do not believe that they always had highly competent treasurers who could disclose at any time the financial position of their small charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of accounting records we operated a system of sub-committees of the parochial church council. Action groups were empowered to act on behalf of the PCC and to spend a certain amount of money—up to £100 each—on work which they considered to be necessary. They were required to report back to the next meeting of the PCC. That was a series of procedures which stopped the practice, with which any Member of the Committee who has served on a PCC will be familiar, of the PCC discussing every single matter in great detail at every meeting. It was a very useful procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it meant that at any given time action groups had a certain amount of money at their disposal for which they kept accounts. However, the treasurer would not have known from day to day exactly how those accounts stood. To ask for such day-to-day accounting is to place an unfair burden on small charities, and particularly small bodies such as PCCs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Richard. I do not want to emulate behaviour in another place and constantly jump up and down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words we have used in the Bill are exactly the same as those regarding charitable accounts used in the Law Reform (Scotland) Act 1990. There appears to be some confusion. the words "day to day" do not refer to the fact that amounts must be entered into a book on a daily basis. If a small charity receives so much on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, at the end of the week when someone sits down to do the accounts he should indicate that on Monday the charity received a particular sum. We are not asking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1991-1992V005P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
anybody to keep accounts on a daily basis but merely to indicate in their records the days on which money was received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the clause refers to "reasonable accuracy". I can tell my noble friend Lord Swinfen that we shall study the entire clause, but we have received no representations to indicate that where this requirement has been introduced under the earlier Act it has created any problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Viscount will not persuade some of us that the Government are right on this matter by reference to some Scottish statute. First, this Government, and no doubt previous governments, have resisted calls to extend pieces of Scottish legislation to England and Wales with the argument that Scotland is a different country. We had an example of of that in the most recent Criminal Justice Act. A Scottish Bill would not have received the same close attention from the charitable movement as this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the words "from day to day" do not necessarily have the precise meaning which has been given to them by the noble Viscount. This is a narrow but important issue and I hope that on the basis of what has been said today the noble Viscount will say, without final commitment, that he is prepared to look at this between now and Report stage. We do not want to impose a greater burden on small charities but there is a real risk that we shall do so if we are not very careful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of concerns have been expressed in relation to the two amendments. All the Government seek to do in the Bill is require that reasonable and proper accounts should be kept and, in the case of this clause, that there should be a record of funds paid in. We shall certainly look at all these matters since the Committee has expressed anxiety. We are trying to place a simple requirement on charities and we do not want that to be onerous. Since the Committee has expressed anxiety we shall certainly consider the matter to see whether we have got it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may push the noble Earl a little further. I am grateful for the extent to which he has moved, but will he take on board the views which have been expressed strongly by Members of the Committee in relation to this amendment and the previous amendment. That view is that to expect trustees to be in a position to determine the financial position of a charity is one thing, but to ask them to keep running accounts so that at any moment in time those accounts would give the up-to-date position of the charity is a different matter. Many of us feel that if the Government are asking for the second they are asking too much of small charities. If they are asking for the first then the clause should be reconsider and redrafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In so far as I have said that everything that Members of the Committee have said about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
matter will be considered, the last point made by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is included in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may put the noble Lord right on one point. It is not the intention that if a person goes to a charity and says "Can I see your accounts" we expect the charity to produce the accounts up to the previous day, which I think is the noble Lord's point. We want them to show accounts up to a reasonable date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Earl has gone one step further than I asked him to go. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 18:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 19, line 5, leave out subsection (5).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 18 I should like to speak also to Amendment Nos. 21, 33, 38, 41, 45 and 46. I am not seeking to exempt charities which are companies from company law regulations but to ensure that they are not exempt from charity law regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands it would be possible for unscrupulous individuals to set up a charity, register it and then turn it into a company limited by guarantee. They could then produce accounts which were misleading from a charity point of view while following the rules and regulations relating to companies. I wish to ensure that all charities comply with a set of common rules and regulations from an accounting point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a view that company legislation is more restrictive than that for charities. That is possibly the case at present but will not be so when the Bill becomes law. The regulations which may be laid down by the Secretary of State relating to accounting matters follow the 	<i>Statement of Recommended Practice 2</i> relating to accounting by charities. As one example, under SORP 2 the charity has to show the amount spent on fund-raising, administration and publicity. There is no requirement for that under the Companies Act. That means that if the Bill goes through as it presently stands and the regulation follows SORP 2, charities will have to show those costs separately rather than, as at present, being advised to do so, unless they are limited companies, in which case if the Bill goes through as presently drafted they could avoid showing those costs separately. That will mean that comparisons between charities on items such as fund-raising and administration costs, in which members of the giving public have considerable interest, could be impossible. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. It involves a simple principle—it is simple to enunciate at least. It is that on the whole all charities should be broadly under the same kind of obligations. Whether or not the charity is under a corporate structure or a non-corporate structure should be irrelevant. Whether a charity is a company and has to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act is one thing, but if it is a charity it should be on all fours with other charities in similar groups. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At Second Reading I raised this question with my noble friend Lord Ferrers. He said that he would write to me about it. I wrote afterwards and asked him whether he would write and I received a letter saying that he intended to reply. I have not had a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case I have in mind is of a charity that has organised itself as a company and wants to be subject to all the charity law. We organised ourselves as a company on legal advice. That had more to do with taxation than with the law we are discussing at the moment. Clarification would be useful because it may be the case that we shall have to turn ourselves back into a trust to comply with the situation as it now stands. I find this very confusing and I expect others will too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my noble friend cannot accept the amendment I hope that he will at least give a straightforward explanation as to why the companies are specifically excluded in this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my noble friend Lord Mottistone for failing to write to him. It was not deliberate. If one does not write letters when one says that one will it is quite intolerable. I apologise profusely for the fact that he has not yet received a reply from me. I shall see that he does. He may find that a written reply is very much more comprehensive and accurate than the verbal reply that I anticipate giving him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position is that charitable companies are required to maintain their accounting records and make annual reports to the Registrar of Companies under the provisions of the Companies Acts. They also have to comply with the current requirements set down by and under the 1960 Act for charities and to submit their accounts where appropriate to the commissioners. Accounts of charitable companies prepared under the Companies Acts legislation are sufficient for the commissioners' purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that it would be undesirable to have two obligations in the case of charitable companies so far as concerns their duties to keep accounting records and so forth. If my noble friend's amendment were to be agreed to, there would be an obligation on charitable companies to provide a set of accounts for company law and there would be an obligation on them to provide a different set of accounts for charitable purposes. That would be confusing to everyone. These matters are for company law and regulation and are not matters for the Bill. However, I understand the reason that prompts my noble friend Lord Swinfen to suggest that there should be a similarity of approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason why there is not a similarity of approach is that a charitable company is different
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
from an unincorporated body. It is subjected to greater strictures. Charitable companies are free to follow the statement of recommended practice which is set out in the guidelines provided by the Accounting Standards Committee, and we encourage them to do so. However, it would be unfortunate if charitable companies were, as a result of the Bill, obliged to provide two sets of accounts—and two sets which would probably be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should consider whether we shall overrun the time suggested for each sitting. We did it yesterday and we are doing it again now. I should have thought that the rules would require, as they do elsewhere, that the sitting should end when the time fixed for the end of the sitting arrives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Common sense dictates that if we are in the middle of an amendment when the time comes, unless it will take an hour or more, it is right to conclude our considerations on that amendment. Otherwise, only the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, will know where we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my noble friend will give this matter further consideration. He says that charities would have to produce accounts to satisfy more than one master. I acknowledge that. However, many charities already do that quite happily. I understand that the Cancer Research Campaign is able to produce one set of accounts in an acceptable format which satisfies more than one master. That is not difficult. Accountants seem to work wonders which I never understand. However, they appear to be able to produce a set of accounts which satisfies both the Charity Commission and company law.

We have reached this hour and I am hungry. I do not wish to delay the Committee. I hope that my noble friend will be good enough to look again at this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
