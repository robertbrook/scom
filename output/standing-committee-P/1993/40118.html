	<time>Tuesday, 18th January, 1994</time>
	<p>	<b>The Committee met at quarter past three of the clock.</b></p>
	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>
	<p>Clause 6 	<i>[Meaning of "earlier trade mark"]:</i></p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 6 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may make a remark on Clause 6 stand part. I apologise to the Committee because this should have been a remark made at Second Reading. However, I hope that as and when opportunities arise the Minister will take the opportunity of trying to persuade our colleagues in the EC to continue with the pressure on the CTMO to back search for previous experiences and registration. The present practice that it is adopting is clearly wasteful. I am glad to see that the British Government are not doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Strathclyde)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend for bringing the Committee's attention to the point. I can assure him that I shall take it fully into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 6 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 7 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 8 [	<i>Rights conferred by registered trade mark</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 16:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 5, line 24, at end insert ("In particular, the proprietor has the exclusive right to use the mark on or in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered in the course of business so as to indicate a commercial connection with such goods or services.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The amendment deals with two matters. The main point is to make clear—I believe that the Bill does not—the main function of a trade mark. The amendment makes clear that the main function of a trade mark is to indicate a connection with trade. It does not exist in its own right. It exists for a trade purpose. A similar matter arises under my amendment to Clause 28. The few words I say now will apply to what we shall come to tomorrow on Clause 28. I shall not weary the Committee at great length tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A relevant consideration is the directive which, curiously enough, says nothing about use other than infringing use. In other words, it leaves out the more general question of use. Clause 99 is the definition clause. I think I am right in saying that, whatever its other definitions, they do not include a definition of a trade mark. One might think again that that is a little curious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions have come before the courts, as I understand it, on use outside the obvious uses of trade
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
marks, which are not infringing uses, which have led to litigation. Therefore, I summarise as briefly as I can the purpose of the amendment, which is abundantly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes the Bill clearer, as the directive does not, on the purpose of a trade mark. I emphasise to the Committee and draw particular attention to the use of my words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"so as to indicate a commercial connection with such goods or services".</p></blockquote>
That is perhaps another way of saying that a trade mark is a trade mark. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord for moving Amendment No. 16. Once again I am in the position, as I was on our first day in Committee, of having to say that I do not think we can amend the directive's wording. Clause 8(1) implements Article 5 of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that in drafting the clause the directive's words have been slightly recast. However, that is because we have chosen to separate the concept of the exclusive right and the right to take action for infringement. Article 5 of the directive covers both those concepts in the first paragraph. But we have dealt with the rights conferred on the proprietor by registration in Clause 8, leaving the detail of exactly what constitutes infringement to Clause 9. In doing that we have, however, stuck as closely as possible to the directive's words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 of the directive sets out the rights conferred by the registration of a trade mark. While it allows a certain amount of latitude in the form of some provisions which a member state may implement, this provision provides that the trade mark owner has substantially the same rights in each state. We cannot add or detract from those rights. As I understand the noble Lord, the amendment introduces substantive change to the rights given under the directive. That is the difficulty in this instance, and that is why the noble Lord's amendment is substantially unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there is an aside to be made to one of the noble Lord's points. Trade mark is defined in Clause 1. I am not sure whether that was the point the noble Lord sought to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am impressed by my noble friend's argument. Does Schedule 2(1) on page 45 of the Bill meet his point satisfactorily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The true answer—I always give that—is that I do not know. I shall consider it and come back to the matter if I have a chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his reply. Although the notes at the beginning of the Bill say that Clause 1 defines a trade mark, in the sense that I use the word "define", it does not do so. That is the problem. One can find examples. When we debate Clause 28 I shall cite the so-called Mothercare/Othercare case, which I am sure is known to the noble Lord. It is a very good example of the problem that one has in mind. I appreciate that there is a problem with the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my other point. We must not introduce into British law measures that will not work in the courts,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
and in particular which prevent a perfectly legitimate use of the word which has no connection with the trade in question. In the case I cite it is the title of a book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what the noble Lord says. I am perfectly well aware that we have a problem in what we can and cannot do with the directive. All I can say on that is that my substantive point, which is the ability to use words in the English language in contexts other than the specific trade mark context, should not be limited. I shall say a few words on that when I come to Clause 28, but at the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 8 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether it is because we cannot legislate outside our own domain that under Clause 8(1) the EC is not added? If so, is there adequate protection for our citizens under Community law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an example that I can deal with by saying that Clause 8 sets out the rights conferred by national legislation, and those are confined just to the United Kingdom. Part II of the Bill deals with Community trade marks which when registered at the Community trade mark office will give the unitary right in the whole of the Community. Therefore the suggestion of my noble friend is a difficult one to accommodate. But perhaps it is something to which I can give further consideration and I can then write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 8 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 9 	<i>[Infringement of registered trade mark]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 17:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 5, line 42, leave out ("where").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: With the permission of the Committee, when moving Amendment No. 17 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 18 to 24. I shall be brief because the amendment concerns the use of the words "identical" and "identity", "similar" and "similarity", and on Thursday I spoke to an amendment which was either similar to or identical to Amendment No. 17. I see no reason to weary the Committee with saying any more on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is concerned with good drafting. I believe the Minister in response to my remarks on Thursday said that he would look at the matter again. I do not want to repeat the arguments. I merely ask him to look at this clause in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Monson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the noble Lord, Lord Peston, in this series of amendments, as I would have had I realised its significance last Thursday when he spoke to Amendments Nos. 6 to 10. In particular, the word "identity" used in the context in which it is used in the Bill is not English as it is spoken or as it is written. It may be English in the purely technical sense but not in any other sense. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will have a good look at the matter between now and the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember whether the noble Lord, Lord Monson, was in the Committee last week when we discussed this problem. We are trying to align the directive and the regulations as closely as possible. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, made a perfectly valid point and I do not dispute it. However, I must make sure that the amendments contain no risk of amending the meaning of the directive itself. That is what I and my officials will be looking at closely, and perhaps it is something to which we can return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may intervene on this point, and again it is perhaps a point on which I should have intervened during the previous Session of the Committee. It is extremely important that we stick as closely as possible to the text of the directives and the regulations. They are documents which it took a great deal of effort to form a consensus upon, and if there is even the slightest risk of a failure to be able to interpret on an international basis, we should rest on the text which was agreed internationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree with the noble Baroness. All of our ambitions are to get the directive embodied in British law. That is what we are trying to do and there is no doubt about that. But I am not convinced, and certainly I am told by my advisers that proceeding along the lines of writing the provisions in decent English and English which the lawyers in due course will have no difficulty putting into practice is not something that we should refrain from doing. My advisers tell me that Amendment No. 17 is perfectly compatible with the directive and we would not be taking a risk. However, I agree with the noble Baroness that we should not take a risk. I look forward to the hope that the noble Lord and his advisers will agree with me and my advisers and that we shall produce a slightly better worded provision. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendments Nos. 18 to 24 not moved.</i>]</p>
	<p>3.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 25:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 6, line 12, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("() A person infringes a registered trade mark if in the course of trade he sells or offers for sale goods which by virtue of their name, shape, colour, packaging or labelling or any combination thereof, are similar in overall appearance to the goods covered by the trade mark and in respect of which the trade mark is used by or with the permission of the trade mark proprietor thereof and such sale or offer for sale without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or reputation of the trade mark.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: While moving Amendment No. 25 I should like to declare an interest in that I am a consultant to a large UK food and drinks company which would like to see the amendment adopted. I might add that it is far from being alone. Several other large and well-known manufacturers have actively been seeking a change to the Bill along these lines, and I believe that they have an extremely strong case which I should like to put to the Committee. However, to avoid confusion I should perhaps state first that the CBI does not hold a single view on the subject. I must assume that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
major retailers would not necessarily go along with the amendment, and the reasons for that will become apparent to the Committee in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the growing problem of own-brand look-alikes; that is to say, major retailers marketing their products for their own shelves in packaging designed to resemble that of a famous brand name or brand leader. A supermarket tomato ketchup appears in a bottle of the same size and shape as Heinz tomato ketchup; a supermarket own-brand disinfectant appears in a bottle of the same distinctive shape, with the grip piercing the bottle, as Dettol; own-brand chocolate appears in the same combination of coloured wrapping as Cadbury's Bourneville. The same thing happens with washing-up liquid, shampoos, deodorants and wine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retailers are not infringing a trade mark because they are not using someone else's trade mark, nor even something similar to a registered trade mark, which I believe would also be an offence. They are giving the customer the general impression that their product is the same as that of the famous brand by combining several characteristic features of the packaging that consumers associate with that product. Such features are unregistered and, I suggest, unregisterable. The type of writing on the label, the shape of the label, the positioning of the logo, the colour of the bottle and of the lid in combination and so on. There are an infinite number of ways in which, with some combination or another, the retailer can bring to the mind of the customer the idea that he is picking up a brand leader when in fact it is an own-brand product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The customer is likely to assume that the brand leader has been specially packaged for the retailer by the manufacturer. In fact that is seldom the case. In the vast majority of instances it is the retailer's own wholly different product packaged deliberately to profit from the customer's loyalty to the famous brand, taking unfair advantage of those brands' reputations and damaging the distinctive character of their trade mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under present law it is theoretically possible to bring an action for passing off, but such actions are in reality difficult to bring. The law requires that the person seeking the injunction has to prove that customers have suffered actual confusion. Manufacturers who have attempted to acquire such evidence have found themselves ejected from the premises of supermarkets. Retailers have also been known to retaliate against manufacturers, so actions are in practice rarely brought. I suggest that a new remedy is needed and that the place for it is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen it argued that the remedy lies in the manufacturer registering his packaging. But that misses the point. However many products a manufacturer registered—and many people would be kept extremely busy if that proposal was followed—there would always be the possibility for retailers to create the general impression of a trade mark by combining together features of packaging that were not in themselves registered. Moreover, the practicalities of registering would be compounded by the fact that manufacturers
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
are constantly changing the packaging of their products to keep up with consumer trends. The practice can be stopped only by making it illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment follows the line of current legislation in other member states of the European Union. In France a remedy exists. An action can be brought for parasitic behaviour and United Kingdom manufacturers have brought successful actions against French manufacturers in French courts. In Benelux countries also a remedy exists. Last year Procter & Gamble sued a Belgian paper producer over a product which had a similar packaging to a Procter & Gamble product. In November, a Belgian court ordered the withdrawal within one week of the offending package. In Germany too brand owners regularly make successful use of the German law against unfair competition and trade mark infringements by proving that an act of piracy has taken place and that the retailer is trying to benefit unfairly from the brand leader's investment and good will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Look-alikes unfairly profit from the good will and consumer loyalty established and maintained at enormous expense by the manufacturers of famous brands. In doing so they deprive those manufacturers of sales and undermine their investment. No one is objecting to own-brand products, but they should not pose as being a product different to what they are. The amendment offers a chance of remedying this manifestly unsatisfactory situation. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the noble Lord, I wonder whether the amendment introduces into the Bill an unnecessary restriction. Will he give the Committee more detail of the surveys that have been carried out? I appreciate what he said about the difficulty of getting into supermarkets and being thrown out. However, there must be a survey somewhere indicating the necessity of the provision in statute and in common law which the manufacturer can assert in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More difficulty may be caused by including the amendment in the Bill. It may be difficult to interpret the clause. Experience in supermarkets demonstrates that, although bottles may resemble one another in shape, each product is distinctively labelled. I do not think consumers have difficulty in distinguishing between HP sauce, Asda sauce or whatever. I suggest that the Bill would be better off without this additional complication. However, if the noble Lord can satisfy the Committee that there is a practical problem, that would be of interest. But I believe that restriction is being put on free competition within the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a consumer, I too would be reluctant to see the introduction of any provision which restricted the possibilities of competition and products other than own brands being available. While I appreciate the arguments about the difficulties, as described by my noble friend in moving the amendment, I believe that Clause 9 increases the protection of registered trade marks. Indeed, Clause 1 extends registration to the shape of goods or their packaging and makes registration of pack designs easier—always
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
provided that they are distinctive—which also adds protection to those concerned, who perhaps are behind the spirit of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Cawley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Passing-off actions are not all that difficult. I have appeared in a number of them. One moves for an interlocutory injunction and, if the judge considers that the items are too close, one rarely proceeds to trial. Therefore, it is not very difficult to obtain relief on an interlocutory application. The defendant will back down or you will back down before the trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A passing-off action may not be an easy proceeding, and of course there are certain difficulties of proof. But in my experience they are not as difficult as has been suggested. The noble Lord, Lord Reay, has given the Committee a splendid dissertation and a bird's-eye view of a passing-off action. I suggest that it has no presence—or ought not to have—in a Trade Marks Bill. One can pass off goods, services or anything by making what one is selling similar to something that is already on the market, and if that is unfair the courts can intervene. However, to introduce this provision into a Trade Marks Bill would cause great confusion and be a considerable restriction on trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the course of his introductory remarks the noble Lord, Lord Reay, appeared to be aiming at own brands. However, the amendment makes no mention of own brands. It appears to suggest that a person might be a manufacturer or a salesman in the own brands of the big supermarkets. Indeed, he may be a retailer who is putting up for sale someone else's spurious material. I am not sure that the noble Lord's amendment hits the target at which he has aimed. Perhaps he will clear my mind about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my noble friend Lord Reay or the Minister in winding up clarify the similarity of the amendment with Clause 9(3) on page 6 of the Bill? That appears to cover much of what has been proposed by my noble friend. Line 10 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the trade mark has a reputation in the United Kingdom and the use of the sign, being without due cause, takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark".</p></blockquote>
It appears that those lines give eminent ground for passing-off actions of every kind as described by my noble friend. I understand that the amendment provides for what already exists in Europe. If that is so, the amendment has some merit and would not depart from the parameters of the European directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Monson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may draw the Committee's attention to another possible objection to the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Reay, said that manufacturers are constantly changing their packaging to keep up with consumer trends. If that is correct—and I am sure that it is—it follows that the uniqueness of a particular packaging cannot be as valuable as he suggests if it is constantly being changed. The second consequence is that it would be unfair on manufacturer B, who cannot know in advance the type of packaging
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
which manufacturer A intends to introduce, if he designs a package which turns out to resemble that produced on the spur of the moment by manufacturer A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nearly all the points against the amendment have been made. Perhaps I may make one or two other comments. The elements of shape, size, colouring and so forth are normal issues which the court takes into account in a passing-off action. The remedy is there. It is in common law and it does not seem to me at all necessary to embrace it in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, when considering trade mark legislation, we are always in danger of straying into other areas; namely, counterfeiting. Members of the Committee will remember that some years ago British Leyland had an action because some of their spare parts were packaged in the same-sized box, with the same colourings and the same diagonal stripes. The only difference was that Leyland was spelt with an "o" and not "e". That is a counterfeiting action. I submit that so it would be in the examples which my noble friend gave. Therefore, I believe that remedies already exist for what my noble friend suggests may happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seems to me that an all-embracing amendment such as this may be held to be stifling genuine competition, and I should be heartily opposed to that. Of course manufacturers would like to protect everything that they produce. They make frequent changes, as the noble Lord, Lord Monson, pointed out. It is for the manufacturer to keep up to date with what his competitors are doing and to seek his remedies where he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the amendment appears to be rather sweeping in that it protects trade marks against an infringement by those names, shapes and other features which may not be distinctive. Therefore, confusion may arise. It could be that those shapes and other features are not in any way related to the trade mark except through use. If, as my noble friend suggests, that use is for a very short period, it seems quite immaterial whether a look-alike product is hastily produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the very nature of changing trade patterns, we are bound to have more products with similarities. An own-brand product is a prime example. I do not believe that the amendment is necessary and it is certainly not in the right place in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for having arrived late at today's proceedings. The difficulty of being in two places at once, even when they are very close to one another, proved too much for me and I felt that I should listen to the opening speech of the noble and learned Lord me Lord Chancellor on the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, despite having missed the introduction of the noble Lord, Lord Reay, to the amendment, I support what I dare say he said. In a spirit of confession, I should say that I am guilty of one of the activities which is proving such a problem to manufacturers. I am guilty of having shopped swiftly in a supermarket. I have looked at two products in very similar packaging
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
and thought to myself, "They must be made by the same manufacturer. The own-brand product is going to be as good as the product made by the brand manufacturer and therefore I will buy the own-brand product". I have passed on in a split second with the other product in my shopping basket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that that does not amount to counterfeiting. When one looks at the similarity of me packaging, one asks oneself, "Was it really necessary to choose the same colour cap, the same shape bottle, the same handle for a container?" I believe that that is calculated to deceive the casual or even not so casual shopper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a further spirit of confession, I agree with comments that have been made about the inadequacy of passing off as a remedy. The Committee will know about the difficulties of obtaining evidence in situations where one needs to obtain evidence from shoppers while they are doing their shopping; and not just as a matter of general survey as regards how the public reacts to different packaging if it were to be put in front of them in a theoretical manner. That makes it extremely difficult to produce the kind of evidence which the courts require. The procedures which the courts offer, although important, are inappropriate in a fast moving market. The fact that it is fast moving does not reduce its importance. As a matter of common sense and in hoping to provide a better remedy, I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important subject and it is quite right that the Committee has taken some time to ponder what this is all about. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Reay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, to some extent, surprised by the reaction of the Committee which did not seem to relate to the point which my noble friend made. I join that consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons that the amendment should be resisted. First, the Community trade marks harmonisation directive sets out exhaustively the rights to be conferred by the registration of a trade mark. There is some latitude in that some of the provisions are cast as optional for member states, but we have taken the fullest advantage of those. It is not permissible to add to the infringement rights provided for in the directive, and the proposed amendment would undoubtedly do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no desire to hide behind the directive. There is a point of principle which needs to be dealt with here. While I recognise the legitimate objection to goods which copy the appearance of established brands, it is difficult to accept that that should be a trade mark infringement. A trade mark owner has the exclusive right to use the mark and prevent its misuse by others. The Bill, in conformity with the directive, extends those rights so that, for example, where the use of the mark on goods quite different from those to which it is registered would take unfair advantage of the mark's reputation, it can be stopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is fundamental to infringement that there is an unauthorised use of the mark or something similar to it. However, in me case of look-alikes, the essential fact is that the mark itself is not being used or imitated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
My noble friend Lord Lyell suggested that all that may be covered in subsection (3). That is the point that I have just made. Subsection (3) requires that the mark or something similar to it be used. The point of the amendment is that the mark itself is not used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A trade mark is registered only after examination by the Patent Office to establish that it is capable of distinguishing its owner's goods and does not conflict with a mark already on the register. Infringement rights derive from that registration and the examination ensures that they are based on something that is entitled to be protected. By contrast, rights envisaged by the amendment would be based solely on the fact that the package has been allegedly copied on which the proprietor has chosen to use his mark but has not copied the mark itself. The scope of such protection would be utterly determinate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, under the new law, it will be possible to register the distinctive get-up of a package as a trade mark. It has been suggested that that would not solve the problem; that brand owners would have to register each little detail; and that the protection which that confers could be easily available. I am not sure that I agree with that point of view. If the appearance of the package as a whole is distinctive, there is no reason that it should not qualify for registration. Under the provisions of Clause 9, anything which is sufficiently similar to cause consumers to associate the two would then infringe the registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Reay suggested that rights similar to those conferred by the amendment already exist in other Community countries. I understand that where that is the case, it is under unfair competition law rather than as trade mark infringement. There is no unfair competition law as such in the United Kingdom. The nearest equivalent is the common law action for passing off. The objection is that such an action involves the need to produce evidence of reputation and damage to it. However, that must be the case with any remedy of that kind, including that proposed in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require it to be established that the look-alike takes undue advantage of or is detrimental to the mark's distinctive character or reputation. I believe that an action for passing off is a powerful weapon and I am supported in that by my noble friend Lord Cawley and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope for passing off is being increasingly broadened by the courts. In particular, it was held last year in the Elderflower Champagne case that there was passing off because, although the consumers might not be deceived, the misuse of the name "Champagne" was damaging to its attractive power. That is the kind of protection that I believe that my noble friend Lord Reay is aiming at in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, this amendment would add to the rights conferred by the registration of a trade mark going beyond what is permitted by the directive, one of the aims of which is to ensure that these rights are substantially the same in all member states. Moreover, while they are sympathetic to the problems that this amendment seeks to remedy, the Government find it hard to accept that one could be sued for trade mark
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
infringement without actually using the mark at all. I have to say that, although I was impressed by the examples of my noble friend Lord Reay-for instance, Cadbury chocolate bars, Dettol and tomato ketchup—I do not think that, generally speaking, the consumer is confused and I believe that he does make a real decision as to which brand to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as I said, passing off provides a powerful remedy. I very much hope in the light of what I have said, and indeed what the Committee has said, that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up much more time, but I should like to make one general point. I am the last person who would wish to stand in the way of fair competition. The noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, my noble friend Lady Hooper and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, have reservations about the amendment on that score. My argument was that this is an example of unfair competition. That is what I was trying to get at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for her support. I must reflect ruefully on the fact that the only person who supported me in the discussion was the only Member of the Committee who was not present when I spoke on this. I shall have to contemplate moving subsequent amendments without speaking to them! I should like to consider what my noble friend the Minister and other noble Lords have said. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 25A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 6, line 30, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(7) A trade mark may be infringed by aural use as well as by visual representation and references in this section to the use of a sign shall be construed accordingly.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Clause 1(1) of the Bill states that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 'trade mark' means any sign capable of being represented graphically".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it includes music or other sounds. For instance, a jingle or other sound could be registered. I am told that in the United States MGM has registered the lion's roar in the context of the cinema. Clause 9(6) makes it plain that, where a trade mark consists of words, the trade mark may be infringed by those words being spoken as well as being visually represented. It says nothing about music or other sounds. One must assume therefore that a piece of music registered as a trade mark can only be infringed if it is represented visually and not if it is played.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that that is right. This amendment seeks to make it plain that a piece of music or other sound which has been registered as a trade mark can be infringed by being played. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Cawley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather doubtful as to whether an oral sound could be registered. I looked in various dictionaries and I have found no indication that musical notation comes within the word "graphically".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord speaks, perhaps I may say that I am intrigued philosophically, if I may say so, by this amendment. I did not read Clause 11 as remotely meaning a trade mark. I should be very interested to hear the Minister tell us about that. It seems to me that that use of the word must have been very definitely chosen. If it had been intended to have music in, something would have been said about that. But it precisely does not say anything about that. Therefore, I am intrigued as to whether singing the notes could therefore be an infringement. I ask that in as much of a spirit of helpfulness as I possibly can. But I find the whole matter very odd. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Reay, has raised the matter so that the Minister can clarify it and tell us about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Reay, could possibly clarify the amendment a little by telling us how you represent graphically a lion's roar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to tread warily here. First of all, let me say to my noble friend that I can agree that the existing subsection (6), which is confined to the spoken use of the words making up the trade mark, may be too limited. I am, however, inclined to think that we do not need separate provisions dealing with spoken use and oral use. I would like to consider further the amendment tabled by my noble friend in order to see whether a change should be made and, if so, what that change should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have managed to have a rather interesting philosophical debate on Clause 1. My understanding of it all in regard to Clause 1, where it says that a trade mark,
	<br><blockquote><p>"means any sign capable of being represented graphically",</p></blockquote>
is that music, for instance a jingle, can of course be written down graphically. That explains what the trade mark actually is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may interrupt the Minister. It is right to talk about music being written down graphically. But, as I understand it, the trade mark would be the notes written down and not the music. I cannot see how that could possibly be compatible with what is written in the clause. That is why I raised the matter. The music cannot be the trade mark; the notes could be. That is why I think the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Reay, is substantive and it is terribly important. I think that he is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could just confuse the matter a little further. I seem to remember when we discussed the copyright Bill several years ago that we had a considerable discussion about music. We found that musical composition, jingles and so on were capable of being copyrighted. If they were capable of being copyrighted, they might also be capable of being trade marks as well. Am I wildly wrong again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are all being intrigued, perhaps I may raise a supplementary point. In Clause 9(6) reference is made to the spoken use of the words as well as the visual representation. If someone speaks words as I am doing now, it is to be presumed that someone else will hear them. Is it not the case that,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
if the Act already allows the spoken use of the words, then the present amendment is perhaps superfluous in regard to the word "aural"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with what the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, has just said. That is the point I was making to my noble friend in reply to his specific amendment. I should like to consider further whether we have drafted that particular subsection too tightly and whether there is a word to say for what my noble friend Lord Reay suggested. Going back to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, about music, I agree with him that notes written down on a piece of paper could be taken as a trade mark. But I understand that that is also meant to mean the noise that the notes make when played.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, asked how one represented graphically the roar of a lion. I understand that the way to do that is simply to write down "the roar of a lion". I am trying to be helpful. I do not pretend to be an expert in this difficult area of the law. But I understand from my advisers that there is nothing unusual in the kind of debate that we have been having today, and that normal practice in the interpretation of existing law has been helpful in sorting out such problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to noble Lords who have taken part in this brief discussion, and to my noble friend the Minister for his sympathetic reception of the amendment. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 9 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 9 is an important clause and could be considered the key to the success of the Bill because it was Section 4 of the 1938 Act which caused so much trouble and which was criticised severely. It is that section that Clause 9 replaces. Clause 9(3) has already been mentioned by my noble friend Lord Lyell in relation to an earlier discussion. I have a query upon which, if I may raise it now and if my noble friend the Minister can respond, I might find myself reassured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a gap in subsection (3)(b) in that there is a reference to goods which are not similar, but there is a deficiency as regards goods which are not similar in relation to the goods being used. The only example I have been able to think of to illustrate that point is if one uses the word "Kodak" on a tee-shirt. Then it would be covered because the protection would be there as it is not similar. But if one uses "Kodak" on a photograph frame or a photograph stand, which is something which may be similar in its use to that of a camera, then there would be no protection. I wonder whether it is possible to have a comment at this point on what seems to be a gap in the protection. I shall be interested in hearing from my noble friend the Minister, if not now, then at some other stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are considering this point may I draw attention to one curious feature
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
of Clause 9 which might be considered. The directive, of course, provides that the proprietor of a trade mark should be able to prevent all persons not having his consent from using the trade mark. Those words appear again in Article 5(2) of the directive. It is significant that in Clause 9 there is no reference to the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem obvious that one does not start an infringement action if one has already given one's consent. But there is a significance about this which I ask the Minister to look at. When one comes to Clause 86 one finds there a criminal offence of infringing a trade mark. So if there is an infringement which does not depend upon consent, one may be subjecting someone who in fact has consent—it may be theoretical—to the sanctions of the criminal law. Perhaps that could be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of my noble friend the Minister if we take all the points arising out of the debate on clause stand part rather than my noble friend respond to each point as it arises. The one I wish to raise is in subsection (4)(d) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"uses the sign on business papers or in advertising".</p></blockquote>
The definition clause contains no definition for "advertising". Therefore what do we mean? It might be better that we have a definition of "advertising" in so far as it affects the Bill, or merely translate the definition which is used in the Control of Misleading Advertising Regulations so that it will be clear. It is the kind of confusion that arose from the music (aural) question that we discussed a short while ago. It seems to me proper that we should be clear at this stage and for the future as to what we understand. I apologise to my noble friend for not having given him notice of this point. I should be happy if he would like to write to me and tell me what he thinks about that point between now and the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken and I shall take up their kind offer and go into this matter a little more thoroughly by letter. Perhaps I may answer one or two quick points raised by my noble friend Lady Hooper. I understand that the problem with the Kodak teeshirt would be covered by subsection (3), but the problem of the Kodak photograph frame would be covered by subsection (2). I can explain that more fully if I write to my noble friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, talked about consent. I was not sure whether or not he was referring to the consent which is contained in Clause 8(1), which deals with consent. Wherever it is raised, the point he made is valid and I should like to reply to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Lucas of Chilworth has difficulty with Clause 9(4)(d) and the definition of "advertising". He may have raised a pertinent point. It is one that I should like to consider further and perhaps I can return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 9 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 10 	<i>[Limits on effect of registered trade mark]:</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (The Viscount of Oxfuird)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the Committee that, if this amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 due to pre-emption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No.26:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 6, line 31, leave out subsection (1).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 29 and 30. Clause 10(1) opens the door to comparative advertising by establishing me right to use someone else's trade mark for purposes of identification. Paragraphs (a) and (b) set down two provisos:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) is not such as to take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the trade mark".</p></blockquote>
It is undesirable to open the road to comparative advertising. That is why I seek to remove Clause 10(1) altogether. Failing that, I shall seek to remove one of the two provisos already in the Bill—that relating to honest practice—and instead to insert another which would require the consent of the proprietor before any trade mark could be used for the purpose set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why Clause 10(1) is in the Bill. There is nothing in the European Community directive on trade marks which requires it. The only reason I can think why it is in the Bill is that it follows the line of a Commission directive on comparative advertising which was once expected to be approved. That directive has now, I understand, been withdrawn by the Commission. Moreover, I understand that recently various governments, including the French and German Governments, were trying to get a consent provision written into the directive. It is extremely likely that if we alter the law, in particular along the lines set out in the Bill at present, we shall simply find that we shall have to alter it again if and when an EC directive on comparative advertising is eventually adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present under United Kingdom law, a trade mark owner can sue under the 1938 Act and can obtain an injunction to prevent the use of his trade mark. In effect, what little comparative advertising takes place in this country, takes place by consent. That is what is believed to occur in the motor trade. There competing companies are rumoured to allow comparative advertising as a result of a convention agreed between them that they will not sue one another. That is the situation that would persist if Clause 10(1) were removed from the Bill while we awaited any further changes in the law which might be made necessary by any future EC directive on comparative advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued in favour of comparative advertising that it is to the advantage of the consumer to receive information from the manufacturer of one product about the product of another. I strongly doubt whether there is much in that argument. A manufacturer is obviously not interested in issuing objective information about another manufacture's product. Typically he will pick out an extremely limited number of features of a competitor's product—perhaps only one—which he can plausibly argue is inferior to
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
comparable features of his own product. Comparative advertising is more likely to add to the sum of disinformation being showered on consumers than the sum of worthwhile information which the consumer needs for forming a judgment and a choice. That is why I suggest that we delete Clause 10(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if that subsection is nevertheless to be retained, I suggest that it should be amended in two ways. First, I suggest that we delete paragraph (a). That is the purpose of Amendment No. 29. Paragraph (a) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of a registered trade mark by any person for the purpose of identifying goods … as those of the proprietor … [must be] in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters".</p></blockquote>
What are honest practices? Who knows what they are? Is it what they do in the motor trade, which is virtually the only sector where, as a result of the supposed agreement between the manufacturers, comparative advertising is carried out? Does it mean that you may say what you like about someone else's product provided you honestly believe that what you say is true? And if you wish to quote a third party about someone else's product—say, a laboratory report or a consumer magazine—would you first need to verify the truth of claims made by such a third party, or not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to those and no doubt many other questions could be found only after a great deal of case law, which I suggest is an extremely troublesome path for us to go down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead—it is the purpose of Amendment No. 30—I suggest that if we are to have the clause opening the way to comparative advertising, such use of a registered trade mark should be permitted only after consent has been given by the owner of that trade mark. That is in fact what takes place in the motor trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard it argued that consent would never be given. I do not believe that that is so. One must not underestimate the attraction of free publicity. What has happened in the motor trade also suggests otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consent proviso would also have the advantage of bringing us into line with legal developments on the Continent. France has recently adopted legislation which permits the use of a trade mark in comparative advertising only after an obligatory consultation period between the would-be user and the proprietor of the trade mark has taken place—a more stringent requirement than this amendment seeks to introduce. I am informed that the French, German, and I believe the Dutch Governments all want a similar provision in any future EC directive on comparative advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
UNICE, the European employers' federation, also supports this position. Therefore I should like to ask why her Majesty's Government are almost alone in standing out against it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in an extremely difficult position in speaking to this group of amendments. I have put my name to an amendment with the noble Lord, Lord Reay. I also agree with a great deal of the noble Lord's analysis. However, I come to exactly the opposite conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my intervention is to speak in favour of comparative advertising, which I do not wish to see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
limited in any way whatever; quite the contrary. I wish to see the law encourage it on behalf of the consumer. What matters in the end is the consumer. During all the years I have been here, I have bored Members of the House with my point that industry exists for the consumer and not the other way round. That applies to trade marks. They are meant to help the consumer. Comparative advertising is a good thing. I wish to see more of it.

A related matter—we see it more and more—concerns the activities of the Consumers' Association which examines products comparatively by reference to trade marks. What the Consumers' Association has been doing I now notice is often followed by serious newspapers which compare products. They say, "This one is better than that, and that" (using its trade name) "is not very good". I do not wish to see anything in law which prevents that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendment No. 29 is the same as the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Reay, but has exactly the opposite intention. It is certain beyond peradventure that comparative advertising will be legal once we introduce the directive into British law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is my objection then to paragraph (a)? It is precisely that it uses the expression—I raised the issue at Second Reading—of,
	<br><blockquote><p>"honest practices in industrial or commercial matters".</p></blockquote>
I am advised—I shall come to it in the next set of amendments—that that is not an expression known to British law. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Reay, made the point that in many areas there is no agreement on what honest practices are, so the whole thing would be useless. I use the expression "bona fide". It is well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to get rid of paragraph (a) precisely to strengthen the ability to engage in comparative advertising rather than the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On more technical matters, I assume that the clause covering comparative advertising is meant to conform to Article 5(5) of the directive. But if the Committee looks at that, the expression "comparative advertising" does not appear in that directive. Article 5(5) certainly does not say anything requiring advertising to be in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters. Again I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Reay, is completely right: this expression was taken from another directive on misleading advertising which is now on ice—meaning that it obviously created more problems than it was felt to be worth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that under the 1938 Act, which we seek to amend, comparative advertising is forbidden. That emphasises the point that if comparative advertising in law as it stands is forbidden, there will be no honest practice to refer to in order to make the law work in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see why the provision should depend on such practices developing within industry or commerce. The criterion to be applied—I reiterate that it applies to everything—is that reference should be to the consumer interests. We should ask, "What is in the interest of the consumer?" What is of interest to the consumer is, first,
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
that comparative advertising should be legal; and, secondly, that comparisons generally using trade names should be legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I laughed inwardly when the noble Lord referred to comparative advertising and disinformation. Those of us in the political world should be careful about criticising anyone for such matters on comparative advertising and disinformation since that seems to be what our leaders are often involved in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, I hope that it will be agreeable to the Committee in due course, or that the Minister will at least think about it, that we take out paragraph (a) because I do not believe that it helps. However, my purpose is to support comparative advertising. I find it paradoxical that the noble Lord, Lord Reay, puts his name to that amendment when his purpose is exactly the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the noble Lords, Lord Reay and Lord Peston, have difficulty with the expression "honest practice". The noble Lord, Lord Peston, goes so far as to say that he does not believe that that expression is known to the law. It is certainly known to the courts. They are ordinary English words, and in the specific case where dishonest practice is alleged the courts will decide the matter using their knowledge of ordinary English words. Therefore the difficulty that seems to have arisen does not have much substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is where I differ with the noble Lord, Lord Airedale. I support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Reay, Amendment No. 29. I do not see how one can legislate for honesty. That is a non-starter. An honest intent by one person may be interpreted as a dishonest intent by another. It is precisely for the courts to determine which is the honest version given in the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go down the road suggested by the noble Lord—I take him to mean that we would leave paragraph (a) in the Bill—then we should insert a whole new clause and define what we mean by "honest". Indeed, in the recent past what we have resorted to is the issue of guidelines, which are generally thought to indicate honest intent. If one stays within the guidelines one is behaving decently, properly and honestly; if one departs from them, it may be that the court will decide one is not so behaving. Therefore, I agree with my noble friend and would like to see paragraph (a) removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was tempted during my noble friend's earlier remarks to engage in a discussion about the practices of the motor industry. I then decided that that might be a hostage to fortune and wished that he had used detergents, soap powders or something like that and then I could have been joined with him. I do not believe that loose arrangements—my noble friend called them "conventions"—are the best way to proceed in matters of comparative advertising. It should be made quite clear what is and what is not permissible. All I would say is that, whatever kinds of goods I have wanted to sell, I always felt it was more profitable to extol the virtues of my product rather man the vices of my competitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the opportunity of supporting the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in what he said regarding honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Speaking for myself, I tried to cast my mind back to the time when I was a Chancery judge and had to construe legislation of this sort. I suggest that this is a clause which is not easily capable of construction by a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can look at a practice, identify it and define whether it is a practice in an industrial or a commercial matter. But one cannot tell whether it is honest without looking at the individual case of the practitioner, because honesty depends upon his state of mind. If one is looking at it in a general sense of what is an honest practice, I would agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. The expression does not have any meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Cawley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause overrules the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the 	<i>Bismag</i> case, a case to which I referred this Committee and in which Lord Justice McKinnon was so bewildered. That case concerned a comparison of the prices for magnesia by the defendants in their advertisement, using the plaintiffs trade mark as a comparison. I always felt that that judgment was wrong in that it ruled out comparative advertising. I am glad that the clause is to be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Monson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Reay, disapproves of comparative advertising, otherwise known as "knocking copy". He seems to believe that it is a recent innovation, but knocking copy is part of a large and reasonably honourable profession as far as British advertisers are concerned. All Members of the Committee will be familiar with newspaper advertisements for motor cars in which five or six different makes of car are depicted. They are photographed together with their logos or trade marks, and against each photograph the price is shown or the number of free extras listed. The inference is that brand or make F is infinitely superior and better value to makes A, B, C, D or E. I see nothing wrong with that. Like the noble Lord, Lord Peston, it is all good fun and helpful in matters of consumer choice and protection. I therefore cannot understand the objection to the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my noble friend Lord Peston in his desire to see the comparisons made to which he drew attention. Perhaps I may make one or two points in regard to the concept of honest practice in business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it is known to the law but it is certainly known to business. In my line of business, which relies on selling advertising for magazines that I publish, what may be thought honest by my salesmen may not be thought honest by anybody else. But leaving that to one side, one phrase which is known to the law is "fair dealing". It appears in a number of Acts. If the courts are able to construe "fair dealing", will they have any great difficulty in construing "honest practice", despite what I said about the advertising industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to differ from the noble, eminent and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, in suggesting
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
that honest practices should have some meaning. But my initial feeling was that the judges would not experience a great deal of difficulty in interpreting what the noble Lord said was good, honest English. Nevertheless, I have a certain sympathy for the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord Howie, that fair practices, or the use of the word "fair", may be a suitable alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the wording does not appear to have any basis in the directive, it appears in the White Paper and has therefore been around for a long time. It is therefore surprising that the consultation procedure which has continued since the production of the White Paper has not cleared up the sort of opposition which we are hearing today to the use of the phrase. Nevertheless, the Bill includes what amounts to an extra hurdle in making United Kingdom trade mark law more restrictive than that in other EC states. Perhaps my noble friend the Minister will give us more information about the reasoning behind the intention of having that extra hurdle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words "honest" and "practice" must be read together. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, raised the question of looking into the mind of the practitioner. Of course, the practice can be honest but the practitioner can be dishonest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again we have had an interesting debate on a matter of importance. We are visibly changing the existing law, although it is apparently possible for a trade mark owner to prohibit any comparative advertising which refers to his trade mark. I say "apparently" because there is some doubt about what the present law actually means; indeed, this is the very provision which, as my noble friend Lord Cawley reminded us last week, Lord Justice MacKinnon described as being of "fuliginous obscurity".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Reay are a reflection of the concerns within industry and commerce on the subject of comparative advertising. However, the Government have been persuaded that there is no harm in comparative advertising—and I tend to side with what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Peston—provided that it makes fair use of a registered mark for the purpose of informing the public. As foreshadowed in the White Paper, the Bill seeks to chart a middle course: allowing comparative advertising but providing safeguards for the owner of a registered mark. Comparative advertising in this form is likely to be reflected in a directive on this subject, which the UK supports. I do not believe that my noble friend Lord Reay would add the provision if he thought that it would not support a directive. Certainly the UK would support a directive that would allow this kind of comparative advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question seems to come down to the protection that should exist either for the consumer or industry. My noble friend's amendment would have the effect of either continuing to prohibit comparative advertising or allowing it, but only with the consent of me proprietor of the registered trade mark identified in the advertisement. I think that both amount to the same as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
prohibiting comparative advertising and are therefore too restrictive, bearing in mind the benefits to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to looking at the hurdles which are provided in Clause 10(1) (a) and (b), I am extremely surprised to discover that there are such problems. "Honest practices in industrial or commercial matters" is the expression used in connection with unfair competition in the Paris Convention for the protection of industrial property. That convention has been in place since 1910. So there is an example that this form of words has been used for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we have not seen this hitherto in English law, but it is used elsewhere in a different context in the directive. There is no reason to believe that our courts should not be able to use it in practice. Therefore, I am concerned by the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver. However, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, these are ordinary English words. Other words are used in expressions, such as "reasonable belief, "unfair dismissal", and "fair dealing" or "best practice", as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon. All require to be looked at individually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fair dealing is a concept which also comes from an international convention—the Berne Convention—and is found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. There do not seem to have been any problems in that regard. The real question is whether we should have this hurdle in place at all. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, would take the view that we should have the hurdle; that we should have a total free-for-all and rely simply on paragraph (b) to provide the protection for, say, unfair advantage. As I said earlier, we decided on a middle way and therefore to provide these two hurdles. I believe that the British courts will be able to decide what is meant by paragraph (a); and what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, will be extremely useful in helping the courts to reach a view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of that explanation, I hope that my noble friend Lord Reay will be able to withdraw Amendment No. 26 and that he and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, will continue to disagree about Amendment No. 29 and will withdraw that and Amendment No. 30. The Government's original drafting in the Bill should stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a debate of some liveliness and I am grateful for the considerable support for the removal of paragraph (a), which appeared to be an example of the extremes touching. Not many Members of the Committee addressed themselves to the issue of a consent proviso in Amendment No. 30. More Members of the Committee seemed to support the extension of comparative advertising rather than my amendment, which seeks to prevent the door being opened any wider. I do not know how representative that is of wider opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the EC directive, my noble friend the Minister said that Germany, France and Holland support that. I do not believe I said otherwise than that my information is that they want to see a consent proviso in the directive. My noble friend did not address that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
It appears to me that we are proposing to change the law on comparative advertising in a direction that we may not be able to sustain if eventually there is agreement on an EC directive. However, I do not wish to divide the Committee at this stage and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<i>[Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>[Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 not moved.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 31:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 6, line 39, after ("the") insert ("bona fide").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 32 to 35. I do not wish to go over the ground again. In not objecting to the withdrawal of Amendment No. 29, I have not changed my mind with regard to "honest practices" and that is why I wish to leave out lines 47 and 48. I shall return to that matter in due course. I believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, and my noble friend Lord Macaulay were right. The expert advice which I received was that the honest commercial practices were not working. It is all very well for the Minister to say that they can start to learn how to do that, but it is not our function at this stage to tell the legal profession, which has a long history of doing things, to do things differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards my other amendment, I am informed that the phrase "bona fide" is well known in the courts and there is a great deal of law on it which will do the job one has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may take this opportunity to say a word to the noble Lord, Lord Airedale. I am not a lawyer. I do not really understand any of this. But what has staggered me, in particular during my years in your Lordships' House, is that the lawyers make an extraordinary meal—it is how they earn their living—out of plain English. It will not do merely to say, "It is straightforward English which you and I understand". That is why I stick to my guns. I believe that what I am arguing is right. I place the matter before the Committee but I do not wish to repeat the points raised in the previous debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the noble Lord give an example of when the use by a person of his own name and address might be in bad faith? I am trying to see the necessity of the insertion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, will answer that when he winds up. I can understand the noble Lord's desire to stick to terminology such as "bona fide" which is eminently familiar to British courts as opposed to the unfamiliar words in the directive. However, I am confident that the courts will be able to get to grips with phrases such as,
	<br><blockquote><p>"honest practices in industrial and commercial matters".</p></blockquote>
I am not telling the courts what to do. I am merely offering the courts an opportunity to use their customary expertise, abilities and good judgment. I am guiding them by using words which I believe will have a judicial meaning that the courts will be able to interpret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
We must stick to the directive's words and not amend them, since doing so changes their meaning. The fact that the directive does not contain the words "bona fide" does not, in my opinion, mean that it allows anyone to use indications of this sort in other than a bona fide manner and still avoid infringing someone's trade mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 35 is purely a drafting amendment. The insertion of the word "or" in the last sentence of this subsection brings the wording into line with Article 6.1 of the directive as well as with the wording of subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister reintroduced the question of honest practices in industrial or commercial matters and he has suggested that the courts should have no difficulty, let us remove ourselves from the courts and put ourselves in the position of the trader. The trader is told by his trade association, "By the way, you must be jolly careful. You know that a new law was passed a year or two ago called the Trade Marks Act 1994 and you might be interested in Clause 10(1)(a)". The trader may ask what is meant by "honest practice". He may say, "Of course I practise honestly, by my lights". What does the law mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that traders do not wish to go to court to create a precedent. They want to understand what is meant by an honest practice in industrial or commercial matters. That covers almost every trading activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed matters to do with the Companies Act in the mid-1980s and the behaviour of directors this matter arose. At that time nobody could determine what was an honest practice. It was said, "We will leave it to the courts", and nothing has happened as regards that description. The phrase might be used in other documentation to which my noble friend referred. But I suggest that it is neither here nor there what is in the Paris Convention at present. We are dealing with a piece of law which will affect traders in the high street, manufacturers and, indeed, people trading in street markets. They want to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Reay withdrew his amendment. Perhaps we might think of something else that will satisfy the Minister. I remain extremely unhappy about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that my noble friend and I disagree fundamentally with each other. He is against comparative advertising, whereas I am basically in favour of it. This Bill seeks to narrow relatively slightly the ability to use comparative advertising. At the end of the day, if there are difficulties with subsection (1)(a), the Government will have to look at it again. But we would not make it tighter. If anything, we would make it more relaxed. My noble friend may wish to think extremely carefully as to whether that is what he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the notion of comparative advertising because, as I said earlier, my magazines live by advertising. If they did not live, they would the, which would be sad for the nation as a whole and especially for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still worried about the phrase "honest practice". I suggest that my advertising salesmen function within
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
a body of morality which is their own. I am pleased to say that they do not tell me everything that they do and I do not wish to know what they do. But they exist within a common morality which is common to advertising salesmen within that industry. I prefer the notion of fair dealing rather than honest practice because whether or not the practices are honest, dishonest or moderately honest, they are fair in that community and they are fair because everyone is functioning according to the same unwritten rules. If that is being done, fairness comes into it and honesty is an interesting by-product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise that I forgot to speak to Amendment No. 35. I believe that the substitution of "or" for "and" is extremely important and not a trivial drafting matter. If I were to read the Bill as that, it would suggest that "honest practices" must be defined for industry and commerce rather than industry or commerce. If we are to have the clause at all, it is right to have the word "or". It is a matter of logic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather disquieted. I am convinced I am right as regards honest practices and the better wording of "bona fide". Therefore, I am not happy to be defeated by the all-embracing argument—which I do not know what to do about—that it would not be putting the directive into British law properly, because I am not willing to believe that we should put into British law a directive which is not right in some sense or other. I am willing to argue that the directive is right and that, therefore, my interpretation, which makes it sensible, is the way forward. I shall return to that in due course. I shall not forget about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the bona fide use of a person's name, I understand that that is a classic problem in the existing law. In principle, I could, being Mr. Harrod, find another Brompton Road and announce that I have a shop called Harrod's on the Brompton Road. I am then getting very close to infringing someone's trade mark. It is closer to passing off than infringing a trade mark. But in a non-bona fide way one could use one's own name and address. That is not a minor matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the Minister that I wish to pursue this matter and I shall return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord withdraws his amendment, I must say that I believe he has put his finger right on the point about bona fide, which is a very well known expression, but which can create difficulties. The noble Lord illustrated the difficulty just now. One always has sympathy with the party who is acting bona fide. But the aggrieved party on the other side is entitled to say, "The damage to me is just the same whether he was acting bona fide or not." It is rather like the author of a book who is accused of libelling someone and says, "I wrote it quite bona fide. I had no idea there was in existence a person of the name of the character in my book." But the other side says, "I am not interested in whether or not he was writing bona fide. The damage to me and to my reputation is just the same whether or not he was writing in good faith".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difficulty which a Bill of this kind has to face in charting a narrow course between two opposing interests. I hope that we shall bear that in mind

The noble Lord said: I have spoken to this amendment and perhaps I could reply very quickly to the noble Lord, Lord Peston.

The noble Lord said: This amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 38A and 41 in my name and Amendment No. 39 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. I apologise to the Committee, and to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, specifically, because I do not fully understand Amendment No. 39. I shall wait for him to speak to his amendment before I comment on it, in the hope that by then I shall understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be easier if we uncoupled the grouping for the time being and come back to it in its order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I do not mind. It happens that I was not easily available earlier in the day and therefore did not form part of the discussions on the grouping. I assume that other Members of the Committee and perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, himself understand these matters better than I do and see a connection there which is slightly beyond me. We can do it either way. We might uncouple it at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area that I am dealing with in my amendment is very technical. I have to proceed rather carefully because I feel somewhat out of my depth. It is very much a legal matter and my expert advice is that it is important. As presently drafted Clause 10(3) does not reflect the directive. We—my adviser and myself—believe that the effect of the directive is wider than the subsection only from its continued use of a prior right in narrow circumstances and would deprive the honest prior user of the right to expand. The relevant article is 6.2 in the directive, which is mandatory. Again, to anticipate the Minister, we must not accord rights narrower or larger in scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6.2 of the directive tells us that the user of a prior right which applies in a locality cannot be prohibited by a later registrant if the right is recognised by the law and is recognised within the limits of the territory in which it is found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask, first, whether the right is a registered mark that is used in an area. Is the right recognised by
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
law? I am advised in connection with that, that passing off will be the relevant law. One of the problems here, which the Minister has been at pains to emphasise to us, is that we are not dealing with passing off legislation; we are dealing with trade mark legislation. Nevertheless we cannot avoid passing off legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that if it is recognised by law in the locality, it can be used within the limits of the territory in which it is recognised. Again, I am advised—this goes back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, which interests me a great deal—that in law the use of the word "territory" means something wider than the use of the word "locality". Therefore we have the interesting point that a mark may be recognised in a larger geographical entity (namely, a territory) than that in which it is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can cite an example which I am sure is extremely well known to lawyers: the so-called 	<i>Chelsea Man</i> case. The mark "Chelsea Man" was used by the plaintiff in a small, high-class clothes shop in London and, believe it or not, in Coventry. However, because of its quality and the transportability of purchases to other parts of the UK—and when we are considering questions of locality it is worth bearing in mind the ease of transport now compared with 1938, let alone much earlier still—this particular mark was known much more widely throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened was that a nationwide injunction was accordingly granted to protect the earlier mark from the later users, even though the areas of actual use were quite limited. In other words, having established the mark locally in London and Coventry, the mark was protected in the whole of England and Wales.

All that gives rise to the need to amend the Bill along the lines that I have suggested. As I understand it—I look forward to hearing what the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, says on this point—the present clause does not recognise or give effect to the word "territory". I am advised that it is a gloss on the directive and actually accords narrower rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Committee is precisely to raise such technical points, and they are very technical. I certainly look forward to hearing whether any of the expert lawyers on the Committee can enlighten me further. As I said, my advice is that precisely the amendments that I have tabled are needed on these matters. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Peston, is absolutely right in saying that we are dealing here with an extremely complicated area of the law. He is also right to say that this is precisely the kind of issue that is appropriately dealt with in the Committee. I shall undoubtedly wish to follow up this short debate on these amendments with a letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments deals with that subsection of Clause 10 which fairly seeks to protect the rights of an unregistered mark which has built up a reputation in a particular locality. The noble Lord's first amendment, Amendment No. 35A, seeks to redefine a particular locality by adding the term:
	<br><blockquote><p>"within the limits of the territory in which it is recognised".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
While the term appears in the directive, we believe that what the noble Lord has done is take it out of context. In the directive it qualifies the term "laws of the member states" and not, as this amendment suggests, the term "particular locality". In my judgment the amendment is therefore unnecessary. The provision as drafted fully recognises and defines that local right and therefore makes the noble Lord's amendment unnecessary. I hope that he will withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised in the noble Lord's second amendment, Amendment No. 38A, is aimed very much at the same point as our Amendment No. 39. The noble Lord said that he did not understand it. I am sorry about that. Like the noble Lord, we have become aware that in drafting the Bill we have narrowed the meaning of an earlier unregistered local right to an unacceptable degree. As drafted it is certainly narrower than intended by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not aware at present of any other law, apart from passing off, upon which the owner of a local right could rely, but we do not wish to draft the Bill so tightly as to exclude such a possibility. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment, because our amendment, Amendment No. 39, is an amendment to Clause 10(3) and brings it into line with Clause 5(4) (a), as amended; in other words, to include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by virtue of any rule of law".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I may explain that we do not want to limit the provision to passing off in case we are excluding some other law which may now be, or become, appropriate. I hope that that is the explanation for which the noble Lord is looking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 41 is aimed at reinstating the provision in the current law—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may interrupt the Minister on this point. Because I thought that we had uncoupled Amendment No. 41, I did not deal with it. Perhaps I may respond. I do not understand the Minister's amendment because, although I see that it is identical to mine, he still uses the word "locality" whereas the essence of my amendment was the word "territory". I was hoping for an elucidation from him. I mean elucidation, because the Minister is well aware that I am out of my depth here as to what is the difference in his mind between "locality" which is already there and "territory", about which my advice has been that that is the word that we need. That is what I want to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. I had omitted to give that explanation. Territory has a meaning in those countries which have laws that, in themselves, recognise local or municipal trade names. It is therefore confined to them. We do not have that concept in the UK. It is not the case in the UK. Therefore my understanding is that it is unnecessary to use those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am out of my depth, and becoming increasingly so following that explanation. I cannot see how a trade mark can be limited to a locality or a territory. A trade mark is a trade mark on a thing, and that thing will be traded throughout the localities and territories about which we talk. I take the point made by the Minister when he talks about
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
continental countries of the Community which have laws which define territories and so on; but he then tells us that we do not have those laws. We seem to be introducing them in a curious manner which relies on territories, in the case of my noble friend, which do not exist. I should like to be brought out of my depth in some way, if at all possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can have a concept of locality in the UK. The point is that other European countries have a concept of a territory meaning, for instance, a municipal territory. It is that concept which does not exist in the UK. I am sorry to make such heavy weather of this, but I was trying to explain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Minister. The notion of a trade mark is laid out in Clauses 1 and 2. We then pass on to infringement and matters of that nature. Clauses 1 and 2 say nothing about territories, localities, or anything of that sort; nor do they suggest that a trade mark can be limited in any way. The notion of limitation seems to pop up here in Clause 10. I am not at all sure from whence it sprang.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What effect does the use of television advertising have on the concept of locality? For example, if I had the use of a mark in Clapham and advertised it on Granada Television, which I understand extends for some distance, do I thereby transform the locality to a territory, or does a territory have a boundary in the concept which the Minister is explaining?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sentence, surely the difficulty with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, Amendment No. 38A, is that it leaves in the word "locality" but in the next line refers to "that territory". That poses the question: what territory? There is no answer, because the word "territory" has not been used up to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two Members of the Committee who have just spoken have taken slightly different views. The noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, explained that one possible definition of the word "territory" would be that covered by a television area. I should probably call that a region rather than a territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to avoid creating local trade marks. For instance, this clause will allow a sign which has a local reputation to be used in the face of a national registered trade mark within its locality, because trade marks can, of course, be registered or unregistered. An unregistered trade mark can be protected from passing off in a protected locality so long as it does not cover the whole of the United Kingdom. That is a valuable protection to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one further difficulty upon which I should like the Minister to advise me. Normally at this point I would withdraw the amendment, but of course what will happen in a moment or two is that the Committee is highly likely to agree to the amendment tabled by the Minister, Amendment No. 39. As I believe that the legislation requires a reference to locality and territory, which my two amendments together insert,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
will the Minister advise me whether, if in due course the Committee agrees to his Amendment No. 39, I am right in thinking that I could still come back and add, for example, after "locality" the expression "and territory", which would solve quite a few of these problems? In other words, by withdrawing the amendment now I should not be withdrawing it for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is no preemption. The noble Lord can return on Report, especially in view of the fact that he has indicated that he will withdraw the amendment. When he comes back on Report, he will have to make the case that adding the word "territory" here will provide an extra meaning which is currently not obvious from the present text.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply. I agree with him—I do not propose to press the matter now—that if I have not made an overwhelming case, I shall get my advisers to produce me a better case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that logically there is a distinction between locality and territory and we wish to have explicit recognition of both. So, having warned the Minister that I shall think more about this, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: We shall have to come back to this matter. In the 1938 Act it was expressly stated that the exercise of rights granted by registration in respect of two or more registered marks which were identical or similar is not an infringement. In other words, having had them registered, it does not become an infringement subsequently. As I read the Bill, that is not clear beyond peradventure. Therefore, it seems to me that once two marks are on the register the use of either should not be an infringement and that should not require acquiescence by either of the two proprietors of the rights. I am interested in the noble Lord's response, in particular, as I understand it, since precisely what I wish is in the 1938 Act but is not in the Bill. I beg to move.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a drafting point, in line 1 of the amendment, surely the words,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston. The amendment is aimed at reinstating a provision in the current law which gives rights to the same or similar marks placed on the register. However, the current law does not, as this Bill does, allow marks which would otherwise be in conflict to be registered with the consent of the proprietor of the earlier registered mark. So far as I can see, the amendment therefore appears to be unnecessary because the right is implicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the noble Lord moves his amendment with feeling. Therefore perhaps I could consider the matter again. In the meantime, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister.

	<p>Clause 10, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 11 	<i>[Exhaustion of rights conferred by registered trade mark]</i>:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 41 A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 7, line 18, leave out from ("goods") to end of line 20.</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: I move this amendment as one of a number of amendments to put into practice the advice given to me many years ago that very often you may wonder whether you are the only idiot in the room not understanding something and in that situation you should ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes the deletion of the words in parenthesis at the end of subsection (2) of Clause 11. There are a number of points in the Bill where in parenthesis the words start "in particular" and then give an example of the preceding words. I am concerned that to say "in particular" in referring to the changing or impairment of the condition of goods may limit the legitimate reasons that are referred to at the beginning of the subsection. I should be grateful for an explanation as to whether the words in parenthesis might not cause more problems than they solve. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 11 implements Article 7 of the directive. Subsection (2), which the amendment would change, sets out a limited exception to the general rule that, once goods have been put on the market under the control of the trade mark owner, he cannot object to further dealings in the goods. This exception applies where there are "legitimate reasons" (which is a question for interpretation by a court) and,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in particular where the condition of the goods has been changed or impaired".</p></blockquote>
Those latter words, which the noble Baroness's amendment omits, are in my view useful as indicating what might be "legitimate reasons". More than that, they reflect the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. For those reasons, the Government included the words in the Bill and I believe that they should stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explains the position to the noble Baroness and that she might feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 11 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 12 	<i>[Registration subject to disclaimer or limitation]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 42:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 7, line 21, leave out from beginning to end of line 22 and insert ('The registrar may require as a condition of registration or continuing registration of a trade mark that the applicant or proprietor may—").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Clause 12 concerns registration subject to a disclaimer or limitation. In my view the registrar should have the absolute power to insist upon a disclaimer. It should not be subject to the consent of the applicant, although of course in many cases such consent would be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking for an equivalent to Section 14 of the 1938 Act and it could be important in the following type of case. A proprietor may apply for a trade mark consisting of what, for the want of a better expression, one might call several integers including, say, geographical indicators. Such integers or indicators may not be distinctive in and of themselves, but taking the separate parts together the mark as a whole may be capable of meeting me appropriate distinctive characterisation required. Therefore such a mark would be entitled to registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The registrar would have no right to insist on a disclaimer of a non-distinctive integer, and the applicant would be able to enforce rights in relation to the non-distinctive integers. I understand that mere is again a classic case to do with California Syrup of Figs—a
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
loathsome substance which my mother used to pour down me many years ago—which would be an example of the problem I have in mind even though the specific point did not actually arise. That kind of case could give rise to abuse by trade mark proprietors which could easily be avoided by the addition of a power conferred on the registrar to insist upon a disclaimer. This again is a typical lawyer's technical point. I was assured that it was important and therefore draw it to the attention of the Committee. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should not me amendment grammatically read "do" instead of "may"? It does not appear to make sense as it stands. The words,
	<br><blockquote><p>'The registrar may require as a condition…that the applicant or proprietor may",</p></blockquote>
do not impose a condition at all. Surely, it should be that the applicant or proprietor "do".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may respond immediately. It is getting late in the day and my mind is not as sharp as I should like. My intuition tells me that the noble and learned Lord is right. Perhaps the word "shall" is better still. However, I do not believe that that wording is substantive to the substantive wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The current law which enables the registrar to require an applicant to disclaim any exclusive use on an element in a trade mark which he does not consider to be distinctive is out of date. Negotiations between an applicant and the registrar on this topic can be protracted and the results are often overtaken by events. What is considered non-distinctive today can in fact acquire distinction through use. Most of those whom we have consulted wish to see compulsory disclaimers ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper on which the Bill is based indicated that there would be a provision stating that registration would not confer any exclusive rights in matter forming only part of the registered mark. Subsequently the view was taken that such a provision in the Bill would be a statement of the obvious. However, I recognise the concern that has been expressed about me rights in the mark which accrue to the proprietor. This amendment and me noble Lord's comments are confirmation of that. If the noble Lord agrees to withdraw his amendment, I will consider whether a statement on the lines proposed in the White Paper can be added to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for those comments. Nothing could be more attractive to me.

	<p>Clause 14 	<i>[Order for delivery up of infringing goods, material or articles]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 42A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 7, line 39, after second ("for") insert ("the obliteration of the trade mark on, or").</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 42A is grouped with Amendments Nos. 42B and 42C. I shall leave it for the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, to say precisely why she prefers "trade" to "a business". I fear that my amendment is in a sense more powerful, and I do not say that in a detrimental sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 is concerned with order for the delivering up of infringing goods, material or articles. I believe that it is excessively draconian. I should be interested to know whether the directive states that we must have this. Essentially, delivering up comes from copyright and patent actions, from which the clause is lifted. There it is appropriate because the essence is that the material or article itself infringes the copyright. However, as regard trade marks, only the mark infringes and that is normally separable from the article itself. Indeed, the whole point of the Bill is to make it clear that the trade mark and the article are not the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Infringement could normally be remedied, therefore, by obliterating the mark or by repackaging the articles. It seems to me that the need for delivering will not be frequent and if it were insisted upon would operate in a most draconian manner. The retailer, in particular, may well find it preferable to obliterate the mark. Therefore the inclusion of obliteration in the Act would signal the possibility of an alternative to delivering up. It would confirm the court's present power and would concentrate the court's mind on whether delivering up was necessary or whether there was an alternative. It would also alert the trader (bearing in mind that often in this type of case the trader will be a small businessman) to me intermediate solution of repackaging or obliterating the trade mark—from my point of view as a result of bona fide actions or from the Minister's point of view as a result of what is honest practice. I should not like to see delivery up becoming in any way central in dealing with trade mark problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is a powerful matter. Perhaps the Minister will indicate how central it is to the directive. I shall think about this matter and I may return to it in due course. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the expression "delivery up", does "up" add anything to delivery? If it does not, could we do without "up"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Airedale, and I could do without "up", but if there is one expression that I see dominating the intellectual property literature it is "delivery up". It is not for the noble Lord or I to infringe the rights of the legal profession, who use "delivery up" all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that in Clause 98, which deals with interpretation and me application of me Act to Scotland, "delivery up" actually means delivery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Monson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support Amendment No. 42A. As it stands, the clause seems excessively draconian. It could involve the innocent—and I am sure that many will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
innocent—attracting a penalty of thousands or tens of thousands of pounds, which does not seem to me to be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am immediately attracted to the amendment in me name of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, but I wonder whether it requires some further thought and whether it may not be rather difficult to check whether a mark had been obliterated. On the other hand, I can see that that remedy may appeal to a court as no remedy at all may be given because the one available was too extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 42B is much less exciting. It is to inquire as to why the term "a business" is used in Clause 14(1). The infringement clause, Clause 9, refers to trade and the definition at Clause 99 of trade is that it includes any business or profession. In other words, business is not the whole of trade and business and trade are different. I should be interested to know why there is no consistency in the terminology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for explaining his amendment. I accept that it might be unjust if the only remedy available were to entail forfeiture of the goods. On that basis, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we should consider this matter further. Moreover, I am not entirely certain that Clause 14 is necessarily the right place to make that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, speak to Amendment No. 42B, I should like to think further about that. I observe that Clause 99, which provides definitions, says that "business" includes "trade" and "trade" includes "business", so the change that the amendment would make seems somewhat arbitrary. However, it is worth considering the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the noble Lord's comments on Amendment No. 42C, this is a drafting change which on the face of it I am quite keen to accept. However, again on the basis that I have to see whether or not anything consequential is required to any other parts of the clause, I should like the noble Lord to withdraw that amendment but on the basis that the principles behind it are probably of the kind that we should like to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not seek to delay the Bill but simply to improve it. I am obliged to the Minister for saying that he will look at this point again.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a question which is raised by my noble friend without any notice. It is something which I shall have to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did mention it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend said that he has given me notice. He raises an interesting point. However, the provision in the clause reflects the current position under Community law in respect of parallel inputs. Therefore it must be maintained.

Again this is a sign of the problems that we have had throughout the Bill in dealing with the directive and trying to put it into UK law in this manner. There is the temptation to improve or increase the provisions in the Bill, but I hope that the position is thereby explained to my noble friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 15 agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Brougham and Vaux)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it is nearly a quarter-to six, the time at which it was agreed to rise, I hope that the Committee agrees that this is a convenient moment to adjourn until Wednesday, the 19th, at 10.30 a.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Committee adjourned at twenty minutes before six o'clock.</p>
