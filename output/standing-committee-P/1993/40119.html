	<p>	<b>The Committee met at half-past ten of the clock.</b></p>
	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>
	<p>Clause 16 	<i>[Rights and remedies of exclusive licensee]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 8, line 39, after ("mark") insert ("and unless the licence provides otherwise").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I should like to move Amendment No. 43 and speak to Amendment No. 43A in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I think her amendment sets out to do more or less the same as I am trying to do, and I am sure that she will explain how her way differs from mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 deals with the rights and remedies of an exclusive licensee. As the Bill is drafted, an exclusive licensee is given all the rights of the trade mark owner as if the licensee were himself the proprietor of the mark. This amendment would enable the trade mark owner to contract out of the rights and remedies conferred by the Bill on the exclusive licensee through negotiations with the licensee at the time of granting the licence. Without this opportunity, the trade mark owner could find himself at a disadvantage. For example, a trade mark owner might wish to keep to himself his right of enforcement in order to retain control of his trade mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Bill as it stands, the licensee would have the right to bring an infringement action without consulting the trade mark owner, even though the owner might have to be brought into the action at a later stage. Such infringements might be at odds with the way in which the trade mark owner himself wished to protect his trade mark and at odds with his enforcement policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16(1) as it stands is also at variance with provisions in other clauses of the Bill, in particular Clause 17(5) and Clause 18(2) and (7) which deal with various forms of licensing under which most of the rights and remedies can be contracted out of. I refer Members of the Committee to page 9, lines 35 and 40, and page 10, line 25, where they will find the form of words of my amendment or a similar form of words enabling contracting out to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why the parties to an exclusive licence should not also be able to contract out of the provisions of Clause 16(1). I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about this, and I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the noble Lord, Lord Reay, realised, my amendment seeks to do what his does—rather less economically with words, I regret. I too wanted to explore the relationship between an exclusive licensee and the proprietor. "An exclusive licence" in the meaning according to Clause 24 is a licence:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the exclusion of all other persons including the person granting the licence".</p></blockquote>
I look forward to hearing why the parties cannot regulate their own relationships as the other clauses provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Strathclyde)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill, of course, already gives the parties the choice whether to agree an exclusive licence, with all the rights which stem from it, or a non-exclusive licence, as these expressions are defined in Clause 24. The latter can be as restricted or as open as the parties determine. As it stands, the Bill defines what an exclusive licence is and the rights stemming from it, allowing the parties in Clause 17(5) to agree on how the concurrent rights of the proprietor and exclusive licensee will be exercised. That seems to me to be a sensible approach. But my noble friend Lord Reay and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised points which I believe deserve further reflection. I shall therefore look at whether, in view of what my noble friend and the noble Baroness said, a change is necessary. In the meantime, I hope that they will withdraw their amendments on the basis of that reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend for his assurance that he will look further into the matter. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<i>[Amendment No. 43A not moved.]</i></p>
	<p>Clause 16 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 17 	<i>[Exercise of concurrent rights]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43B:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 9, line 30, at end insert ("and in the event that the proprietor and the exclusive licensee are not both parties to the action then the court may given such directions accordingly as to the extent to which the party to the action is to hold the profits on trust for the other").</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: Clause 17 deals with the remedies and the provisions for the court to give an account of profits to apportion the profits. My amendment is again a probing one in the sense that I should like to ask a question based on it. It is to provide that, if the proprietor and the exclusive licensee are not both parties to the action, then the court can give directions as to how the profits are to be held. I have used the term "on trust" rather than "on behalf of, which is a term used elsewhere. I have an amendment down later seeking to explore the distinction between them as to whether it is a trust relationship or an agency relationship. I explain that now because the Minister may prefer to deal with both points together, but we can take them separately if he would prefer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What it boils down to is that I wish to ask about the position as regards any apportionment of profits in circumstances in which the proprietor and the licensee are not in fact both parties to an action. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the noble Baroness explained her amendment. We come today to a series of amendments put down by her, most of which I recognise are probing amendments. She has explained what her amendment means and I think that this is something on which we would like to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
think further. There may well be a case where we have not fully explained what we mean within the wording of the clause and I should like to look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that response. In the circumstance, of course, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 17 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 18 	<i>[Rights of non-exclusive licensees in relation to infringement]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Haskel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43C:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 9, leave out line 42 and insert ("directly affects his interests under the licence.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment to Clause 18 speaks about the rights of the non-exclusive licensee. I am concerned about the use of the words "his interests". The present wording allows very wide interpretation and I feel it needs to be rather more accurately defined. It is not clear whether a non-exclusive licensee or a non-exclusive sub-licensee may bring infringement proceedings in any case where a proprietor refuses or fails to do so. Again, if a licensee is granted the right to use the power or, in relation to one of several categories of product within the specification group of the registrant, and an infringement is identified in a different category—a product but within the specification part—can the licensee in this case call upon the proprietor to bring infringement proceedings? I can well imagine that this clause could be used by a non-exclusive licensee, who was perhaps not satisfied with the arrangements, as a means of withdrawing from the agreement. It seems to me that we more accurately define the intention with the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"directly affect his interests under the licence".</p></blockquote>
I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the noble Lord is trying to clarify matters and to be helpful to the Committee. On that basis I am happy to consider the case that he has made. I hope that the noble Lord will understand that, as on the face of it his amendment limits the licensee's right to take infringement proceedings on those matters that directly affect his interests, I must consider the matter further before making any firm commitment as to whether or not we should deal with matters on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Haskel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has set out, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43D:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 9, line 43, after ("refuses") insert ("to take such proceedings").</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: This amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 43F, which makes the same point and is another probing amendment. Amendment No. 43D refers to line 43 on page 9, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the proprietor refuses or fails to take such proceedings within two months after being called upon to do so".</p></blockquote>
My amendment seeks to move the words around. As the clause is drafted, I am not clear whether the two months applies only to failure, or whether a separate question
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
may be asked about whether the proprietor has refused. It seems to me that if the proprietor refuses, and that is clear earlier than two months, then there is no point in waiting for the two months to elapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, one might want a proprietor to say after the two months: "I am still considering it; that may, or may not amount to a refusal", and so on. If the two months' limitation is to apply merely to the failure, then it might be clearer to have the words shuffled around so that it is obvious that the two months applies directly to the failure. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, would I be right in supposing that the noble Baroness's wishes would be met if the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"within two months after being called to do so"</p></blockquote>
were put after "if at the beginning of the paragraph?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no particular proprietorial interest, if I might put it that way, in the wording that I propose. My intention was to explore the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, and I note the amendments and the comments that she has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two months applies to both. I am not sure from the noble Baroness's amendment exactly what it is that she wants. As these subsections are drafted, they fully provide for the licensee to embark upon infringement proceedings on his own name in the event of the proprietor refusing or failing to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I recognise that there could be a concern here, and I should like to have the opportunity of looking at it further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful to the Minister, and in the circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<i>[Amendments Nos. 43E and 43F not moved.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment 43:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 10, line 20, leave out ("on behalf of') and insert ("in trust for").</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: On page 10, Clause 18(5) provides that the court make directions as to the extent to which the proceeds of a pecuniary remedy are to be held on behalf of licensees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment replaces the words "on behalf of with the words "in trust for". Again, it is a probing amendment to explore what responsibility the plaintiff has in such circumstances, given that I believe that a fiduciary relationship may perhaps impose more obligations than the agency relationship. It is a small point, but again I seek clarification. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again I recognise that the noble Baroness is trying to be helpful in seeking this clarification, and that the amendment is a probing one. Again, in giving a reply, I have to make sure that it is absolutely correct. Therefore, on that basis, I should like to consider the issue further and give it due consideration over the course of the next few days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 18 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 19 	<i>[Remedy for groundless threats of infringement proceedings]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Haskel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43H:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 10, line 34, leave out ("aggrieved") and insert ("who is so threatened").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with the remedy for groundless threats of infringement proceedings. I believe that the inclusion of this provision is merited and will reduce the number of spurious threats of action under the trading laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am a little concerned about the use of the words "person aggrieved" at line 34. I am told by our advisers that a considerable body of case law exists. It has not produced a definitive resolution as to the meaning of these words. I will not trouble the Committee with the briefing that I have on this matter. It is likely therefore that dispute will arise as to who is and who is not aggrieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "threatens" is used satisfactorily at line 28, and it seems sensible to include it in line 34. So my amendment is to alter the wording to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person who is so threatened may bring proceedings for relief under this section".</p></blockquote>
I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may make a point on that. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, in moving his amendment seeks to improve the definition and facilitate proceedings. Nevertheless, he has succeeded in his amendment in restricting the right. One could have an example of a retailer being threatened by a trade mark owner with proceedings and the manufacturer of the goods that are under threat would not be covered as a result of this amendment; whereas "aggrieved" is a wider definition which would allow the manufacturer of the goods a remedy as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to rise because the two amendments were grouped together. I have two points. First, I believe that we need Clause 19, and we may come to that in a moment on clause stand part. I should be interested to hear what the noble Lord has to say about the relationship of Clause 19 to the directive, and whether it corresponds precisely. On the use of the word "threaten", we need something of this sort because there is a need for a safeguard, but not to the overwhelming disadvantage of the proprietor of the trade mark. One has to get a proper balance. My judgment is that on the whole this clause does that reasonably well. On the other hand, we are aware that there are unscrupulous proprietors of trade marks, and something must be done about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with that, and in connection with what the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, said, we ought to notice how the clause is drafted; namely, that the first part of the clause has this "other than" section which is vital to the understanding of the clause. In other words, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are the "other than" parts and the question of "aggrieved" only arises other than that. That is very important. The problem as I see it is really
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
to do with what constitutes a threat of action. The expert advice that I have received is that this is an area of considerable complexity largely arising in the fields of patents and registered designs where such actions currently exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of my proposed amendment is that it would help trade mark owners to seek information from retailers and wholesalers—they must be able to do that—but without falling foul of a threat of action by ensuring—I emphasise "ensuring"—that mere notification plus a request for information should not be construed as a threat. The proprietor, having got some suspicion, must be able to ask about the relevant information. Therefore, my judgment is that adding the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether with or without a request for information as to the source of specified goods",</p></blockquote>
helps the proprietor without in any sense undermining the position of the aggrieved party. Subject to the point I made right at the beginning about the directive, I believe that this is a matter that the Minister ought to take very seriously indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask for clarification. Where does the word "aggrieved" come from? Why is it necessary to use the word "aggrieved"? It has a certain connotation. I wonder whether the appropriate words might be "affected by" such threats. That might meet the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper. "Aggrieved" carries with it a certain direct connotation on a one-to-one basis, whereas the words "affected by" give a modern approach to the remedy available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "aggrieved" will be found in the corresponding section of the Patents Act and is therefore fully understood by the courts. I think that the view put forward by my noble friend Lady Hooper is a correct one. The directive defines the rights concerned in infringement but the remedies are left up to national law. Amendment No. 43H would nullify one of the main purposes of this provision, which is to allow a company whose customers are the object of an unjustified threat of infringement proceedings to protect itself. If the company producing the alleged infringing goods is itself threatened, it can take a view on whether to defend the action. The customers have, however, no interest in so doing. Faced with a threat of legal proceedings, the course of least resistance is simply to stop buying that company's goods. That is why that company needs to be able to protect itself by an action for unjustified threats. Limiting this right to the customer who received the threats—who, as I have said, simply wants to keep out of any legal proceedings—would not be enough. Therefore, I have difficulty with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, concerning Amendment No. 43J, I agree that a mere request for information—for example, as the source of alleged infringing goods—should not be regarded as a threat of proceedings. We had thought that it was unnecessary to state this, but perhaps we should do so in the light of the concerns raised. I should like to look at that again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may already have achieved part of what I sought to do by giving notice of my intention to oppose the Question that Clause 19 shall stand part of the Bill. I felt it was important that there should be on the record the reasons for the inclusion of the provision. I mentioned the matter at Second Reading. I made light of the fact then that threats had been made by the makers of a film about dinosaurs in that they sought to restrict the terms "dinosaur" and "Jurassic" for their own use. As I said then, that has an air of absurdity about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the serious effects that there may be on a retailer, and consequently on a manufacturer, if a retailer is threatened improperly, given that his response may simply be to return the goods because it is easier not to get involved in the argument. I also recognise that there are similar provisions in the patents and registered designs legislation. However, it is to my mind important and noteworthy if there is a statutory restriction on threatening proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that one should start from the basis that the law is available to be used and that it is reasonable to put to a person one believes is infringing one's rights that one will seek the protection of the law. I wonder too whether the clause might not go too far in that it may inhibit the proprietor or a licensee from threatening action even if a threat is justifiable, and thereby produce the very mirror image of the situation that it seeks to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave notice on the clause—although I anticipate that I shall be persuaded—because I felt that the Government should put on record their explanation of the inclusion of the provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Cawley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that the clause is otiose in that there is a perfectly easy way of getting round threats. One merely threatens an action for passing off. One does not mention one's registration. There is nothing in the Bill that limits the rights in passing off. In fact, they are specifically preserved. I think that the clause is quite useless and ought not to be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her remarks. Like her, I agree that it is worth spending a little time on the clause. I should like to explain in some detail our thoughts behind the clause so that there is no doubt in anyone's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides for a remedy for a threat to take infringement proceedings where the person threatened is not the primary infringer and the person making the threat has no grounds for doing so. It introduces a remedy for those aggrieved by such threats and defines the relief available to them. It brings trade mark law into line with that for patents and designs and implements a commitment made in paragraph 3.31 of the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
The person aggrieved by the threats will not necessarily be the person against whom they were made. They may, for example, have been made to a manufacturer's customers, and since they may have no interest in defending a possible infringement action they may simply switch suppliers. It seemed only fair that the person who loses business in this way should have a redress against such threats where they are groundless. An alleged primary infringer—the person who himself applies the trade mark to me goods or is the importer of the goods to which the mark has been applied—cannot, however, take advantage of this provision. If he considers that threats of action are groundless, it is up to him to decide on the likelihood of an action ensuing or succeeding and on whether to defend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is a fair provision. It is clear that a big company can use its position to frighten people by the threat of legal action. My department receives complaints from small companies which feel outgunned in this way. As everyone knows, legal proceedings are expensive—very often extremely expensive. Anyone such as a shop selling goods which are alleged to be infringing who does not have an interest in defending the action is likely to respond by simply switching to another supplier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that this provision inhibits the trade mark owner from pursuing counterfeit goods. It must be stressed that this remedy is available only against the groundless threat. The final subsection states that a mere notification—a letter that just hints of infringement proceedings—is not a threat for the purposes of this provision. This subsection is for the avoidance of doubt. We believe that the same applies also to letters which simply ask for information—for example, concerning the source of goods—again provided that the communication does not contain either explicit or veiled threats. I hope that that explains the situation to the satisfaction of the Committee and I trust that the clause will now be agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, I was rather devastated by the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Cawley. The Minister did not deal with the point that essentially this clause is a complete waste of time. The Minister may not feel that he wants to deal with the matter now. The noble Lord, Lord Cawley, knows about these things. Having said that I thought the clause was very important, I was rather taken aback by the noble Lord's remark. Perhaps at some stage the Minister can deal with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had misheard my noble friend, but I did not. The point is that we have to consult on these issues and we believe that there is a problem. It probably is not as big a problem as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, or I may think. I too am immensely respectful of the views of my noble friend. We believe that there is a problem here. There is a potential worry that people need to be protected against. That is why we put it in. We believe that it is a fairly clear clause and I hope that it will be successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too was very taken by the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cawley. I would imagine that it is common, when one believes that one's rights may be infringed, for the "heavy letter" written on behalf of the proprietor to include every possible remedy that the author can think of, and probably ends up with all other rights reserved as well. I am not sure whether there may be a problem over one paragraph in a letter while the rest of it may stand. I believe that the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cawley, deserves further attention. I shall not seek to press any part of this matter further at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 19 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 20 	<i>[Nature of registered trade mark]:</i></p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 20 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may ask my noble friend one question which I believe is a simple one. Clause 20 states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A registered trademark is personal property".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean "personal" in personal terms or personal to a body? It seems to me that what happens in Scotland indicates that corporate ownership is included. If that is so, how is that derived?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend says that he has asked a simple question for clarification. However, I am not sure that I can give him an answer at this time. I am not sure that the question is quite as simple as he said. I should like to take advice on this and write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 20 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 21 	<i>[Co-ownership of registered trade mark]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Haskel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43K:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 11, line 13, leave out from beginning to ("entitled") and insert ("In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, a co-proprietor shall not be").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This clause deals with joint ownership of a trade mark. It seems to me that joint ownership is a bit of a minefield. Under the present wording the joint owners of the trade mark can use it separately unless they have an agreement to the contrary. It appears to me that the joint owners of a trade mark should be encouraged to use it jointly, like a copyright, but if they are going to use it separately, then they should have the consent of all the proprietors of the trade mark. The issue is important because if the clause is allowed to stand as drafted, partners can trade under the mark in their own right. For instance, if there are around 40 owners of a trade mark in a law practice, they can each practise under that same name, causing great confusion. That is undesirable because it creates uncertainty in the minds of the public as to who is providing the goods or the services under the trade mark. My amendment seeks to force the owners of the trade mark to have some sort of agreement, so that if the owners are going to use it separately, it is done by virtue of an agreement between them rather than using it without any agreement at all. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, again, thank the noble Lord for his amendment. I understand his the desire to clarify the matter. I share his concern here, as I am sure do other Members of the Committee. The wording of Clause 21
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
is based on that of Section 36 of the Patents Act 1977. While I am happy to consider the noble Lord's amendment, it changes the presumption from one where anything which a co-proprietor does is governed by the agreement between him and the others to one where it is not. That is something which I shall have to consider in greater detail rather than in this brief reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Haskel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 21 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really wish to ponder something. I very definitely do not wish to ask the Minister a question requiring a reply. I notice that Clause 21(4)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"assign or charge his share in the registered trade mark",</p></blockquote>
and then in brackets,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(or, in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
It says this, that and the other. That came to my mind in relation to the remarks on the last clause by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, where again the reference to Scotland is in brackets. Towards the back of the Bill there is a clause, at about Clause 93 or so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Clause 98.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Baroness. That tells us what the English expressions mean in Scotland. I am wondering why, in these two clauses, the Scottish reference is in brackets in that specific place in the Bill, whereas all the others are grouped together at the tail-end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that there is a great problem here. Clause 98 deals with interpretation and expressions, whereas here, in brackets, we are dealing with an extension of how the particular provisions apply to Scotland. It is perfectly normal drafting practice so I do not believe that there is any difficulty at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask a question and I hope for an answer from the Minister. I have given him advance notice of this matter—if he has his piece of paper—concerning the same clause. The noble Lord, Lord Howie, was referring to Clause 21(4)(b). Here we enter into one of several problems which follow in connection with company law and other commercial law. We talk about assigning or charging his share in the registered trade mark, but that may not always be possible. 	<i>Force majeure</i> does arise sometimes. For instance, if a company has given a mortgage and general charge, it is possibly true to argue that it should not have given the mortgage and general charge in the first place without the consent of its co-registrars or proprietors. But more pertinent is the question of when it has lost its rights altogether under liquidation proceedings and so forth. It seems to me that here there is a problem, perhaps not of drafting, but of perception: that it may not always be possible to implement this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been given notice of this particular aspect. Again, it deals with a relatively complicated issue. The problem which my noble friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
raises is that it should be dealt with in other legislation. In itself, it is not something which applies to the Trade Marks Bill. Therefore, it is not pertinent to this clause. I am not certain that that is helpful to my noble friend, but perhaps I may write to him more fully when I have the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I wonder whether it is quite right to say that the matter is nothing to do with this Bill. Is it sensible to put into a Bill something which can be overridden by another Act or which will cause two Acts to come into conflict? We must face up to that problem when drafting a Bill. I do not wish to be awkward and I am certainly not being hostile. I am trying to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend makes a helpful point and he is quite right to raise this issue. But the point which he makes is more relevant to other legislation, in particular, insolvency legislation, rather man legislation dealing with trade marks. But there may be a point of substance in this regard which I have missed. Therefore, I shall consider the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the point of principle, my noble friend is absolutely correct. We do not wish to cause conflict between various Acts. We need to avoid that. Therefore, I am extremely grateful to my noble friend for raising the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my noble friend give further consideration to the point and perhaps inform the Committee as to his views on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consider the point further. This matter should not prevent us agreeing that the clause shall stand part of the Bill. But I should like to consider the point further in detail and write to my noble friend with any clarification. If an amendment is required, that can be brought forward at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 21 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 22 	<i>[Assignment, &c. of registered trade mark]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Oliver of Aylmerton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 44:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 12, line 1, leave out ("a vesting") and insert ("an").</p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord said: This is a typical Chancery lawyer's little amendment. It is designed to eliminate a legal solecism from the Bill. Members of the Committee may have been mystified by it. The fact is that the expression "vesting assent" has a peculiar significance in law. The ordinary way in which property is vested in a beneficiary or anyone else by a personal representative is by an ordinary assent in writing under Section 36 of the Administration of Estates Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a controversial amendment and, indeed, I notice that the word "vesting" has been dropped from government Amendment No. 44F. It is merely to prevent a solecism in the Bill. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the noble and learned Lord has said demonstrates why we have a Committee stage. I cannot ignore the expertise which he brings to the proceedings and I should like to accept the amendment. I would have accepted Amendment No. 45, which also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
stands in the noble and learned Lord's name, but government Amendment No. 44F removes the subsection to which it applies. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for bringing the point to our attention and I am happy to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Question, amendment agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 44A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 12, line 13, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("() The provisions of subsections (1) and (2) shall have effect in the case of an unregistered mark used in relation to any goods or services as they have in the case of a registered mark, if—
	<ol>
	<li>it is or was assigned or transmitted at the same time, to the same person and in respect of the same goods or services as a registered mark; and</li>
	<li>at the time of the assignment or transmission of the unregistered mark it is or was used in the same business as the registered mark.").</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: My amendment deals with a legal matter. The background to it is paragraph 8 of Schedule 3. The first part of that paragraph, which deals with the assignment of registered trade marks, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 22 … applies to transactions and events occurring after the commencement of this Act in relation to an existing registered trade mark; and the old law continues to apply in relation to transactions and events occurring before commencement".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the old law as to assignment shall continue to apply indefinitely to marks registered pre-commencement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that that has the odd result that the common law rights associated with registered marks may be assigned without good will for the pre-commencement marks but not for "new" ones. I am advised that that is clearly a legal anomaly which the noble Lord should examine further. Perhaps he will explain the nature of Clause 22 either now or on a subsequent occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to consider the amendment. However, I have difficulty in reaching agreement with the noble Lord because I am not convinced that this provision would introduce what is needed. Subsection (6) of Clause 22 states the general proposition that the Bill is without prejudice to the assignment of unregistered marks. Therefore, I am not certain that what is proposed is needed. It was needed in 1938 because the law stated for the first time that trade marks could be assigned, but I am not sure that it is needed in this Bill. I am always happy to consider the points which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, makes and in the meantime, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too shall reflect, or have someone else reflect, on the Minister's reply to discover whether an amendment is needed at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurs to me that here we have a paragraph in a schedule which describes how Clause 22 is to apply. Would it not be more helpful for the reader if, in addition or instead, the clause itself had a subsection which stated that it applied in particular circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unhappy with the way in which the Bill is currently drafted. There can always be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
discussions and arguments as to the best way in which to do these matters. But I am advised by parliamentary counsel as to the way in which these matters should be carried out and I am happy with that. If the noble Lord believes, on reflection, that something is wrong, perhaps he will raise the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg leave to withdraw the amendment</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 22, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it makes any difference, but is my noble friend aware that the definition of the word "good will" may change under Accounting Standards Committee current considerations? There are divided views on the subject. But that point should be borne in mind by those responsible for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend for raising the issue. The matter of good will is full of pitfalls for the unwary. I am aware that the standards may change 	<i>vis-a-vis</i> the application of good will. However, I can confirm that that will not change this reference to good will because the term "good will" in this legislation is clearly understood in terms of trade marks law. But I am grateful to my noble friend for raising the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 22, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 23 	<i>[Licensing of registered trade mark]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 44B:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 12, line 19, at end insert ("or for a limited period").</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: Clause 23 deals with the characteristics of a licence and subsection (1) provides that a licence can be limited in the way provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b). It is only since our debate yesterday about territory and locality that I wonder about limiting the use to a particular locality. I think that that might be quite difficult to police and to monitor. However, that point does not lie within the scope of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the above is a probing amendment. In many areas of business, a licence may be given for the use of the subject matter for a limited period rather than the manner or place of its use. By the amendment, I am seeking to inquire of the Government if a licence may be granted for the use of a registered trade mark for, say, two years. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first time, this Bill, in line with the directive, fully makes clear that licences can be granted to enable others, in addition to the owner, to use the registered trade mark. In respect of those areas in which there were residual doubts about what a licence may cover—some or all of the goods and services of the registration, the manner of its use and geographical coverage—provision is made specifically in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has never been any doubt that a licence can be for any term determined by the parties to the licence. Therefore, I see no need to provide for that or to amend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
the Bill. I hope that that deals with the point made by the noble Baroness. If so, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Going against one or two of the remarks that I made yesterday, I think that it might have been more helpful if other limits applied, but paragraphs (a) and (b) are shown to be examples—perhaps, "in particular". However, I note what the Minister said. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, wishes to speak. I give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that it is just a general matter in respect of licensing and nothing to do with the specific Bill that there is no mention of a specific period of time? I am puzzled by the logic of the clause. Subsection (1) goes out of its way to mention the spatial dimension which again, for all I know, is something which happens generally so that there can be no doubt. It also mentions what one might call the nature-of-the goods dimension. Logically, there is only the third dimension; namely, time. Therefore, I believe the noble Baroness is right, although I did not realise it until I heard her speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be some sort of inconsistency here. Why mention the place and the nature of the product, so to speak, but feel that time does not need to be mentioned because it is always available? That causes me to ask whether paragraphs (a) and (b) are therefore new, which I would take for granted in that sense. Is there something more explicit that the Minister can tell us as to why time is not mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main answer is because there were doubts about that aspect, but not about others, in the United Kingdom and in the European Community. Indeed, there are other aspects which are not included. Perhaps I may go a little further and explain some of the thinking behind what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment moved by the noble Baroness also puts a gloss on the directive which our provision follows. That goes back, perhaps, to our first day in Committee when I had to keep saying that, although the principle was there and that, perhaps, there was something in the case being made, we have to follow the directive wherever possible. That is what we are doing by way of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the time-honoured manner, I think I should say that I will reflect on what the Minister said. However, perhaps he will also reflect on what I said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 44C:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 12, line 20, leave out ("A") and insert ("An exclusive").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: With the leave of the Committee, I move the above amendment standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Haskel and will speak also to Amendment No. 44D. I should explain that the two amendments emanate from the consideration of the Bill by the Law Society of Scotland which took the view that the clause as it stands is too restrictive and may create practical difficulties in trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
The amendments provide that, in order to be effective, only exclusive or sole licences for the use of registered trade marks require to be in writing. The amendments do not require every licence to be put in writing; but, on the other hand, they do not preclude non-exclusive licences from being in writing. The view taken is that the Bill's requirement that all licences should be in writing is unreasonable and inconsistent with the other provisions of the Bill. If the clause remains unamended it would require, for example, every retailer to obtain a written licence from every trade mark proprietor before selling goods which bear trade marks; for example, selling any well-known soft drink or, perhaps, some stronger drink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The society's amendments would ensure that the retailer can rely on verbal licences or the provisions of Clause 11 (1). In the second amendment, the society feels that it is reasonable for a written licence, whether exclusive or not, to be binding on singular successors, if the licence does not provide otherwise. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord spoke to his amendment very clearly. However, it has the effect of making only exclusive licences which are in writing effective. Before drafting the provision, we consulted interested circles fully on the drafting of the Bill; indeed, we discussed the draft with the members of our Departmental Standing Advisory Committee on Industrial Property. They told us that they definitely wanted to see all licences in writing. In their experience, nearly all licences were in writing anyway, and they opposed the idea of a new law which does not provide for such important documents to be in a written form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the noble Lord is suggesting that his advice is that that is not the case, then I shall be very happy to consider the matter further. However, as regards the specific point made by the noble Lord, a retailer, for example, can sell genuine goods without any licence and, indeed, the trade mark user's rights are exhausted when he sells the goods. The amendment is therefore contrary to what retailers have told us they want to see and to that which we promised. I do not take any ideological or political view on the matter. If the noble Lord has any further information, I shall be happy to see it. But, as such, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the clause.

	<p>	<i>[Amendment No. 44D not moved].</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 44E:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 12, line 30, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("() Use by a licensee in accordance with the terms of a subsisting licence in relation to goods or services for which the trade mark is registered shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act and at common law to be use by the proprietor in relation to those goods or services, and references to the goods or services of the proprietor shall be construed accordingly.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: There is nothing in the Bill to ensure that the use by the licensee is considered to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
accrue to the benefit of the proprietor. In that sense it seems to differ from Section 28(2) of the 1938 Act. It is an important matter because we really need to ensure that the reputation in a mark—which I believe is the right expression—does not become fragmented by use through a licensee and therefore cause the mark to lose its distinctiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the matter is precisely preserving the value of the mark. It does not seem to me, unless I have misread this or other parts of the Bill, that we are quite doing what happened in the 1938 Act. I cannot see why we would not want preserve the reputation of a mark in this way. So I am probing the Minister's mind to see essentially how the Government thought about the matter. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord will be happy to hear that I am pleased to be probed on this. Clause 23 deals with licensing and defines the regime which is to be followed under this Bill. It replaces the regime under Section 28 of the 1938 Act, while continuing the assumption (in that Act) that use by or on behalf of the proprietor is use of the mark and will be sufficient to avoid an action for revocation on the basis of non-use. However, Clause 23 does not contain a definition of what constitutes use by a licensee. This is to be found in Clause 42(1)(a), which indicates that use either by the proprietor or with his consent is sufficient to defeat an action for revocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing this, we have followed the format found both in the directive (Article 10) and the Community trade marks regulations, both of which separate the concept of what constitutes use from the articles governing licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord's amendment departs from this formula in that it would define use by the licensee in Clause 23. This is the point that I should like to consider. I think it is quite clear that use by the licensee (whether or not he be a sub-licensee) is use with the proprietor's consent. What I should like to do is to consider whether it would assist to have a definition of what constitutes use by the proprietor in Clause 23 in addition to the definition of use in Clause 42.1 suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is probably in agreement with that course of action and will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the noble Lord. I am very much in agreement with that course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may anticipate what he may say about Clause 42, I think that that is reasonably favourable to the wording of the directive. Although I have in mind to place an amendment before the Committee on that matter, on the whole and on reflection I am pretty happy with what the Minister has told us. Therefore, looking at Clause 23 as a whole, the Minister may respond subsequently to the suggestion I make. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 25 	<i>[Registration of transactions affecting registered trade mark]</i>:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 44F:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 12, line 38, leave out subsection (1) and insert:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>("(1) On application being made to the registrar by—
	<ol>
	<li>a person claiming to be entitled to an interest in or under a registered trade mark by virtue of a registrable transaction, or</li>
	<li>any other person claiming to be affected by such a transaction,</li>
</ol>
the prescribed particulars of the transaction shall be entered in the register.</li>
	<li>(1A) The following are registrable transactions—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>an assignment of a registered trade mark or any right in it;</li>
	<li>the grant of a licence under a registered trade mark;</li>
	<li>the granting of any security interest (whether fixed or floating) over a registered trade mark or any right in or under it;</li>
	<li>the making by personal representatives of an assent in relation to a registered trade mark or any right in or under it;</li>
	<li>an order of a court or other competent authority transferring a registered trade mark or any right in or under it.").</li>
</ol></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment replaces the whole of subsection (1) of Clause 25. The provision is concerned with the registration of transactions such as assignments and licences. The purpose of this latter amendment is to make clear that either party to a transaction can apply to register it, and indeed that a person may apply to register past transactions to which he was not a party but through which he derives his title to a registered trade mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this rather improves the drafting of the Bill and I very much hope that it will be welcomed by the Committee. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend again. My understanding of this clause is that a specific provision cannot be overridden by, for example, bankruptcy law since it concerns the registration of transactions. Even a liquidator will have to comply with the provisions if he wants his interests protected. I think that that covers the point my noble friend made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 25, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clauses 26 and 27 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 28 	<i>[Application for registration]:</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>Page 14, line 23, leave out from ("(b)") to end of line and insert ("the name").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Clause 28 concerns the procedure for filing an application for the registration of a trade mark. Subsection (2) sets out what an application must contain. This amendment clarifies the intention so
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
far as the minimum requirements needed to identify an applicant are concerned. All that the registrar requires is the name and address. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 46A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 14, line 29, after ("services") insert ("to indicate a connection with the proprietor in the course of trade").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In speaking to this amendment I certainly do not wish to underemphasise my belief that Clause 28 is tremendously important. But I argued yesterday, I think in connection with Clause 8, that it is an important consideration that the trade mark should not be protected where it is used for purposes which have absolutely no connection with the purposes or the area originally sought. I cited the classic Mothercare/ Othercare case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take that kind of example more generally, the use of a word which is a trade mark in the title of a book which has no connection with the goods or services involved should not be limited. I shall not pursue the matter in any more detail because I pursued it yesterday. Therefore, it would be helpful to state expressly that the use of the mark envisaged is use in the course of trade to indicate a commercial connection with the proprietor. We are discussing here the nature—almost the definition—of a trade mark. So the purpose of the amendment is to make that as clear as we possibly can. But we had some discussion on it yesterday and I believe that the Minister said he would think about it. I shall certainly accept his arguments in regard to that. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I note the noble Lord's comments. As he says, I have already undertaken to consider the points he made in arguing for Amendment No. 16. I am not sure that I entirely agree that there is an advantage in adding these words. Why is it not sufficient to require use "in relation to" the goods or services? I note that not only does Clause 42, which deals with revocation for non-use, simply refer to use in relation to goods or services, but also that the same expression is used in Section 26 of the present law, without any mention of indicating a trade connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does not deal with rights but is simply an admission that the proprietor intends that it be used. Therefore, I again acknowledge the point that the noble Lord made and will look at it further. I just put that argument forward at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before withdrawing the amendment, perhaps I may ask a question. The point at issue here is that many ordinary words are used and they have become trade marks. We must make it absolutely clear that one is not limited in the use of ordinary words in things which almost have a trade mark quality, like a book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that this is a copyright example, but I shall give it anyway. There is the classic case where before the Marx Brothers made their film "A Night in Casablanca", Warner Brothers wrote to them threatening them with, in this case I think, copyright action for the use of the word "Casablanca" in their film. The Marx Brothers wrote back to say that they had used the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
word "Brothers" earlier than Warner Brothers had and would be obliged if Warner Brothers would take it out of all their logos and other things of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one example. But it seems to me that there is always a danger that someone might, to use a vulgar expression, try it on in respect of words. All I seek to do is to make sure that that cannot and should not be done. I do not need to give further refinement, but that is what I am trying to clarify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be very brief, and I do not want to continue this discussion. The point is that the trade mark has to be distinctive. That is the issue with which we are dealing. I may have to consider the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 31 	<i>[Claim to priority of Convention application]:</i></p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 31 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to Clause 31, I should like to ask my noble friend the Minister a question. I may have missed the point here, but I do not see why a filing in any Convention country does not rank as a filing in all the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair question on Clause 31. I can tell my noble friend that filing in a Convention country does not rank as a filing in all the rest. An application must be filed in each of the countries of interest in the applicant, using the original application or registration as the priority document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will of course soon be possible to make an application under the Community trade mark regulations for registration of a trade mark, which will be thereby protected throughout the whole Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend asks why we cannot make the application in just one country, and that be enough. Sadly, that is not what has been agreed. Therefore we have to continue to proceed on this basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand from the Minister that there is a prospect when new Community law is passed that a single filing will suffice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 33 	<i>[Examination of application]:</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>Page 16, line 22, after ("representations") insert (", whether written or oral,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment is to do with the examination of applications at the Trade Mark Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, representations to the Trade Mark Registry are made in writing and at hearings, held in accordance with the trade marks and services rules
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
1986. I am told that that system works very well. I wonder whether the wording of this clause should be altered slightly to maintain the status quo and include oral hearings as part of the representations. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the noble Lord has thoughtfully put forward in his amendment. The registrar always aims to be flexible in the way in which applicants for registration are dealt with—using the telephone; correspondence; personal interviews; as well as more formal hearings—in order to resolve the problems with an application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no need to change that policy as a result of the Bill, and the qualification that the noble Lord seeks to add to the subsection is therefore not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, by putting in the qualification, that in itself could cause problems. By specifying how the representations must be made to and considered by the registrar it could deny the registry and its users the opportunity of taking advantage of changes in electronic communications as a result of developments in information technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in the interests of both the registry and its users, and with my assurance that the flexibility in approach will continue to be the registrar's policy in communicating with users, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Haskel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's explanation and assurances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>Page 16, leave out lines 37 to 41.</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment is a matter of clarification. It seems to me that this clause provides an opportunity for malicious delay. This provision could amount to what one might call a "busy-body's charter". Certainly, this provides the widest possible opportunity for opposition and creates a wider platform for objections to be raised. But it has the merit that the objector has to expend money and effort in order to impede a mark's registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in order for the registrar to administer this scheme, a procedure would have to be established which would mirror the opposition system. In short, if the objector is serious, the objector would be required to show opposition in the normal way. I should like to hear the Minister's view on this point. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will see that there are two amendments here, Amendments Nos. 46B and 47, Amendment No. 47 being in my name.

I have listened to what the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, has said. As he indicated, subsection (3) of Clause 34 covers the procedure which allows for third parties to make written observations on applications once they have been published. It is an arrangement for which the interests that we have consulted have asked and it was always our intention that the registrar should pass these on to the applicant before taking any action on the matter. That is what happens at present under the Patents Act 1977. It is also what will happen under the Community Trade Marks Regulation. We are anxious that our national practice follows what would be done in the Community Trade Mark Office wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is already possible to file observations, but in an unregulated way. There is no problem, I understand, under corresponding applicants' provisions. But users of the system have pointed out that it will be of greater certainty if the Bill actually states that any observations made should be communicated to the applicant, and he should be given an opportunity to comment upon them. We accept that point. That is what would be done in Amendment No. 47. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, will feel that I have dealt with his point, and that he will give me his support on Amendment No. 47.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: Subsection (3) of Clause 35 deals with the amendment of applications for registration once they have been accepted. Such amendments must have been published so that others are aware of them. Persons adversely affected by such amendments may then wish to contest them.

The noble Lord said: Subsection (1) of Clause 38 deals with the duration of the registration and provides for that to date from either the filing date, or, in the case of an application which has claimed priority, from an earlier overseas filing from the priority date. Users have told us that they want the duration of their registrations to start from the filing date. That, after all, is the date from which their rights start, and we have accepted their view.

	<p>Clause 42 	<i>[Revocation of registration]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 49ZA:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 19, line 14, leave out from ("that") to ("it").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I simply wish to raise a point of logic and of drafting. Clause 42(1)(c) states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that, in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor".</p></blockquote>
I do not know why the phrase "in consequence of acts of inactivity" is included. There are only two possibilities. Either the proprietor is active or inactive. Therefore, to echo the noble Lord, Lord Cawley, these words are otiose. What other possibilities are left once those two are taken into account? I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the way in which the noble Lord has made his point. The clause is based on Article 12 of the First Council Directive which lays down the grounds for revocation of the registration of a trade mark. This particular subsection concerns the ground for revocation when a mark becomes a generic name or term for goods for which the mark is registered. It takes account of any action, or inaction, of the proprietor of the mark in defending his mark from it becoming commonplace. The proprietor might act in a way which renders the use of the mark generic or he might act in a way which prevents it from becoming generic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord's amendment would remove the reference in subsection (1) to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"acts or inactivity of the proprietor".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would therefore have a profound effect on the rights of the proprietors of marks in the cases where trade marks become generic names or terms for goods or services for which the marks are registered, despite all the efforts of the trade mark owner to inform the public that the name which they may use casually as referring to a kind of article is in fact a registered trade

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
mark. So, far from this being a simple issue, the amendment would have a profound effect. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am staggered by that reply. I am a devotee of the Community and I have already said that we must introduce the directive into British law. But whatever the Community can do, it cannot suspend the laws of logic. I have to insist that there are only two possibilities—activity and inactivity—and if there are not, I should like to know what the other possibilities are. Therefore I insist that that expression cannot, in the use of the English language, be adding anything to the clause. Moreover, if it is meant to be adding something to the clause, we need a different amendment which tells us what it is meant to be adding. I insist—of course I do not insist, but I should like to know what else can happen between acting and not acting. I do not need to know now, but I very much need to know at some time. Otherwise, the Bill will look silly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to approach this point from a slightly different aspect and to agree with my noble friend. It occurs to me that a number of items have become commonplace. Most obvious are items such as the Hoover and the fridge, where a trade name has become a commonplace generic title. It strikes me that the Hoover people are quite pleased about this and would not object to it in any way. They would therefore engage in inactivity about it. They would be quite happy and would do nothing about it. Having been inactive, there might be a possibility that their trade mark would be revoked, whether they wished it or not. That is how the clause reads to me, and it seems very quaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a possible interpretation of the clause. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, said that he would not insist. Perhaps I have been hiding too much behind the directive. I shall examine this further and try to make it clear before we reach the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I meant by saying that I would withdraw my insistence is that I did not want to break the rule on dividing the Committee. I thought that all I was doing was enjoying myself and putting forward a drafting amendment. I am now worried because the noble Lord seems to be implying that this is a matter of substance. What we must do, therefore, is exactly what the noble Lord said. We must both reflect on it and come back to it. In my ordinary way of looking at it, it looks as though we do not need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hamwee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 49A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 19, line 34, at end insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("() For the purposes of subsection (1) proper reasons for non-use are reasons determined by the registrar or the court to be reasons outside the reasonable control of the proprietor.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: This is another probing amendment. Clause 42 deals with revocation, and four grounds are set out in subsection (1). Subsection (1)(a) gives as a ground that the mark has riot been put to genuine use and there are no proper reasons for non-use. The Minister may say that the lack of definition of proper reasons is quite deliberate in that one should apply common sense and trade practices at the time to assess whether a reason is proper. My amendment seeking to define proper reasons, which I have suggested are reasons outside the reasonable control of the proprietor, is an attempt to work out what the proper reasons could be. It seems to me that they are ones to do with the outside and not with oneself or anything within the control of the proprietor. The underlying point is to inquire how one assesses the propriety of reasons. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Baroness explained the amendment extremely clearly and I am grateful to her for that, but I am afraid that we have in Clause 42 a clause which implements mandatory articles of the directive—namely, Articles 10 and 12—which concern the use of a trade mark and the grounds on which it may be revoked if it is not used. They provide that the registration of a trade mark may be saved from revocation for non-use if there are "proper reasons" for the non-use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the noble Baroness's amendment adds a new subsection after subsection (3). This new subsection defines what would constitute proper reasons for non-use; they would have to be those reasons which were outside the proprietor's reasonable control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present law, the kind of thing which is acceptable as a reason for non-use is something which is totally outside the proprietor's control. It has to be something which is common to the trade, and was due to some special circumstances in the trade, such as an export or import ban which prevents the proprietor making or selling the goods which bear the mark. It would not, however, cover something which is specific to the proprietor—for example, his particular business difficulties. The noble Baroness's amendment would appear to extend the presently-understood meaning of acceptable reasons for non-use of a trade mark, and to re-define an expression in the directive,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(proper reasons for non-use)"</p></blockquote>
which ought to be left to the courts. I hope the noble Baroness will feel that that is a full enough explanation and will feel able to withdraw this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 51:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 48, line 39, leave out from beginning to end of line 11 on page 49 and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(2) Before the end of the prescribed period after the date of the application for registration of a certification mark, the applicant must file the regulations with the registrar and pay the prescribed fee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If he does not do so, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>8.—(1) The registrar shall consider whether the requirements mentioned in paragraph 7(1) are met.
	<ol>
	<li>If it appears to the registrar that those requirements are not met, he shall inform the applicant and give him an opportunity, within such period as the registrar may specify, to make representations or to file amended regulations.</li>
	<li>If the applicant fails to satisfy the registrar that those requirements are met, or to file regulations amended so as to meet them, or fails to respond before the end of the specified period, the registrar shall refuse the application.</li>
	<li>If it appears to the registrar that those requirements, and the other requirements for registration, are met, he shall accept the application and shall proceed in accordance with section 34 (publication, opposition proceedings and observations).").</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Schedule 2 sets out the administrative arrangements under which applications for certification marks are considered. The amendments are designed to streamline these arrangements, for the particular benefit of the applicant for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the current law, and under the Bill as it stands, the registrar of trade marks considers an application for registration of a certification mark and, if satisfied that the conditions for registration are met, asks the applicant to submit the regulations governing the use of the mark. These are considered separately by another division of my department, the Department of Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider that it would be sensible for the registrar to undertake both tasks, without any reduction in the level of service to applicants. Applicants will then only have need to deal with one arm of Government, rather than two as at present. This
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
is likely to result in significant improvements in the handling of applications for certification marks. Amendments Nos. 51 to 56 change Schedule 2 in order to achieve this. Amendment No. 61 to Schedule 4 is consequential on these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for including quite so many amendments to this schedule, but I believe that it certainly improves this particular provision, which I hope meets with the agreement of the Committee. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendments Nos. 52 to 56:

	<p>On Question, amendments agreed to.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Schedule 2, as amended, shall be agreed to?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards this schedule, I wish to refer to an issue which I raised at our first sitting; namely, certification marks in Clause 3. I am still not content. I have raised this matter with my noble friend's department and I thank him for his letter. I wonder whether, under Schedule 2, and the first paragraph, we are heading for trouble in having contradictions present. My concern is with Clause 3(1)(c). If we had reached this stage when we reached this particular provision, I would have tabled an amendment. After lines 16 to 19 what I would have added would have made clear my anxieties. I would have added a new sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided also that a certification trade mark shall not be refused registration by virtue of paragraph (c) above".</p></blockquote>
This is an issue which I have already discussed with my noble friend's department. I am not convinced that, by banning generally quality, geographical origin and so forth in isolation, one is not in fact contravening what certification trade marks are all about in Schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to have clarification that paragraph (c) does not refer to certification trade marks. Perhaps we may take the classic example; when talking about geographical factors, one is outlawing Sheffield. One is outlawing 100 forms of discrimination which may not have arisen as yet. The Minister has to give attention to this point because I am not convinced that the explanation which he gave me in his letter will invariably stand up to occasions and circumstances which might arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to look further at this particular issue. It was very helpful to hear the reasoning behind my noble friend's anxieties concerning this particular schedule. It was our belief
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
that, in the drafting as regards not only this schedule but also Clause 3(1)(c), we had got it right. That may not be the case and we shall have to look at it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend may wish to table an amendment at Report stage to give an example of what he means. However, I shall look at it further. My noble friend used the example of Sheffield. Geographical names as certification marks are clearly provided for in Schedule 2, paragraph 3. I am still not totally certain what is my noble friend's problem. I shall read what he has said and see whether or not there is something which we have missed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Schedule 2, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clauses 47 to 53 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 54 	<i>[Emblems, &c. of certain international organisations: Article 6]:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 56A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 24, leave out lines 32 and 33 and insert ("of international or inter-governmental organisations of which one or more Convention countries are members, or, in the case of international organisations, institutions which accept donations direct from the public for charitable or humanitarian purposes.".</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This clause is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. It refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"armorial bearings, flags or other emblems",</p></blockquote>
which I believe are subjects which are dear to the hearts of your Lordships. I therefore felt that I would take the opportunity to give the Committee a chance to examine it. I have tabled the amendment largely because I am somewhat intrigued by the exact wording of the organisations to which this clause applies. I confess to the Committee when I first read it I missed what it said. It actually says, "International, inter-governmental organisations". I thought that it read "International or inter-governmental organisations".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I ask the Minister through this amendment is whether that is exactly what he has in mind. To begin with, the point is that there can be international organisations of which governments are members, but which are not inter-governmental organisations. Is it the intention of the Bill that such international organisations of which governments are members, but which are not inter-governmental organisations 	<i>perse,</i> are covered by this clause? More generally, I look at other international organisations where governments may not be members, but which are essentially operating on the basis of funds from governments. I point out their charitable or humanitarian nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is very much a probing one asking for clarification. Is the clause really meant to be as limited as this and should it be so limited? I shall certainly welcome comments from the Minister. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly what the noble Lord is trying to say. Clause 54 needs to be read in conjunction with Clause 55 since, together with Clause 53, they give effect to obligations under Article 6	<i>ter</i> of the Paris Convention. Subsection (1) of Clause 54, to which this amendment relates, is merely introductory. In order to be protected under this provision, an emblem has in the first place to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
protected under the Paris Convention. That is stated in subsection (2). As Clause 55 explains, this means that the emblem must have been notified to the United Kingdom under the provisions of the Paris Convention. Such notifications are made through the intermediary of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which would not agree to notify in respect of an emblem other than one falling within the clause as drafted—that is, an inter-governmental organisation of the kind referred to. I know that the noble Lord is trying to be helpful here. I know that he was probing. I hope what I have said covers his anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the noble Lord, but I am not entirely sure that I follow what he has said. I am aware that we have to look at all these clauses together. I am still slightly worried by the precise expression "international, inter-governmental organisations". I am not sure what organisations the Minister or the Bill have in mind. Am I right in saying that there is a distinction between the international organisations which are inter-governmental and other international organisations which would be appropriately defined as inter-governmental and with which governments are involved? I am thinking on my feet. For example, the European Union is an international organisation, but some parts of that are inter-governmental organisations. Now the two are distinct. I am asking the Minister whether he can tell me what it is that this expression refers to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord is getting slightly carried away, even though he is thinking on his feet. As I understand it, this clause brings into effect our current obligations under the Paris Convention dealing with international inter-governmental organisations. The noble Lord raises an interesting point as to what is an inter-governmental organisation. We are talking about organisations such as UNESCO and NATO and the Community symbol, although I am not sure whether that is still in existence after Maastricht. But those are all protected under Article 6	<i>ter</i> of the Paris Convention. I am not sure what the problem is—and I shall consider what the noble Lord said—but that is the effect of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. He has been extremely helpful because he referred to NATO. I believe that that is what is meant by an international or inter-governmental organisation. But the European Union is not an example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred also to the symbol of the European Union. If my understanding is right—and it is very much an "if—the European Union is not an inter-governmental organisation. It is an international organisation. I am merely asking for enlightenment as to whether the clause applies to the European Union. I do not wish to prolong the discussion. I merely read the clause and wondered about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make sure that the Paris Convention is properly incorporated and I am merely asking whether the drafting of the Bill achieves that. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: The amendment ensures that the time limits for the doing of anything required under the Bill can, if necessary, be extended. The intention is that the registrar should have the ability to extend time limits, whether those are prescribed by the rules or specified by the registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, subsection (2)(e) allows rules to be made granting an extension of prescribed time limits; that is,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
time limits prescribed in the rules. It does not, however, allow the extension of time limits which are specified by the registrar, such as those provided for in Clause 33(4). The present amendment overcomes that deficiency. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
