	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>TRADE MARKS BILL [H.L.]</h1></div>
	<p>	<b>The Committee met at half-past ten of the clock.</b></p>
	<p>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (The Viscount of Oxfuird) in the Chair.]</p>
	<p>Clause 74 [	<i>Fees</i>]:</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 74 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to Clause 74(1) and (2) (a), where we appear to be giving somebody—it is not clear who—an open-ended authority to charge exactly what he likes. I do not believe that that can be intended. It is rather an important point of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Strathclyde)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 74 enables the Patent Office and the Trade Mark Registry to require fees to be paid in respect of matters under the Bill. The Patent Office is required to recover its costs through fees and as an Executive Agency must make an average annual return of 6 per cent. on capital employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the last Report to Parliament by the Comptroller-General shows, the Patent Office provides a cost effective service to its customers. Levels of service have improved but fees have been held at the 1991–92 levels, and international comparisons show that the levels of service provided by the UK Patent Office and the fees charged are very competitive. I believe that that demonstrates that the Patent Office is not intent on using this clause other than responsibly, and in any event the fees to be charged under the Bill are subject to agreement by Ministers and to a negative resolution procedure in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we continue, can I ask everyone to keep as quiet as possible because it is extremely difficult for the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporter to hear what is going on when people are shuffling papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was extremely difficult for me also to hear what the Minister said. In fact I missed half of it. I shall obviously have to study what he said very carefully. I cannot believe that it is right to have in a Bill, whatever the conventions, practice or current regulations of the Patent Office are, an authority which is totally open-ended. Some reference should surely be made in the Bill to those restrictions; otherwise one day the department may be segregated from the Patent Office but it would still be operating under the Bill. However, there would be no restrictions on it. I can foresee the day when, like the motor tax, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be using it as a convenient opportunity for raising funds in the normal course of taxation. One must guard against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that there is the remotest possibility of what my noble friend suggests coming to the fore. He may feel that an amendment is necessary at Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 74 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clauses 75 to 80 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 81 [	<i>Privilege for communications with registered trade mark agents</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 57ZA:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 33, line 19, after ("from") insert (", or in Scotland protected against,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Amendment 57ZA deals with privilege for communications between registered trade mark agents and their clients. In Scots law of evidence there is no equivalent of what is known in England and Wales as legal professional privilege. It is a general rule of common law that such communications are confidential. This amendment recognises that and I would ask you to agree to the change. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 81, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clauses 82 and 83 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 84 [	<i>Power of Commissioners of Customs and Excise to make regulations</i>]:</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 84 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can say whether this is an example of the necessity of private citizens to enforce the law, and whether that can be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may draw the attention of the Committee to Note 2 which points out mat, if there is an italicised note in the Marshalled List, any Member who wishes to speak on clause stand part should warn the Chairman of Committees. I have had no such notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Deputy Chairman. I did warn the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point being made is that informing the Government is one thing, but the Rules of the House require that the Public Bill Office must also be told what is happening. That obviously cannot be a government responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my noble friend Lord Harrowby is speaking to Clause 84. Many provisions of the Bill deal with the powers of proprietors of registered trade marks to enforce their rights in those marks. To that degree, all those provisions are concerned with 'private enforcement" of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 84(2) permits the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to make regulations which specify the content of the notice which the proprietor of the trade mark is to give to them, if he wishes to take advantage of the provisions of Clause 83. Clause 83 permits the proprietor to enforce the rights the Bill gives him against infringing or counterfeit goods from non-EC countries by requesting the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to stop them from legally entering the United Kingdom at a time when they are in one place for customs clearance and before they are dispersed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 84 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 85 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 86 [	<i>Fraudulent use of trade mark, & in relation to goods</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must warn the Committee that should Amendment No. 57ZB be agreed to, Amendments Nos. 57A to 57P inclusive cannot be called due to pre-emption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 57ZB:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 35, line 17, leave out subsections (1) to (4) and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(1) A person commits an offence who fraudulently—
	<ol>
	<li>applies to goods or their packaging a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark, or</li>
	<li>sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale or hire or distributes goods which bear, or the packaging of which bears, such a sign, or</li>
	<li>has in his possession, custody or control in the course of a business any such goods with a view to the doing of anything, by himself or another, which would be an offence under paragraph (b).</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) A person commits an offence who fraudulently—
	<ol>
	<li>applies a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark to material intended to be used—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>for labelling or packaging goods,</li>
	<li>as a business paper in relation to goods, or</li>
	<li>for advertising goods, or</li>
</ol>
	<li>uses in the course of a business material bearing such a sign for labelling or packaging goods, as a business paper in relation to goods, or for advertising goods, or</li>
	<li>has in his possession, custody or control in the course of a business any such material with a view to the doing of anything, by himself or another, which would be an offence under paragraph (b).</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) A person commits an offence who fraudulently—
	<ol>
	<li>makes an article specifically designed or adapted for making copies of a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark, or</li>
	<li>has such an article in his possession, custody or control in the course of a business,</li>
</ol>
knowing or having reason to believe that it has been, or is to be, used to produce goods, or material for labelling or packaging goods, as a business paper in relation to goods, or for advertising goods.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) For the purposes of this section a person acts fraudulently if he acts—
	<ol>
	<li>with a view to gain for himself or another, or with intent to cause loss to another, and</li>
	<li>without the consent of the proprietor of the registered trade mark.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) A person does not commit an offence under this section unless—
	<ol>
	<li>the goods are goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered, or</li>
	<li>the trade mark has a reputation in the United Kingdom and the use of the sign takes or would take unfair advantage of, or is or would be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(6) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he believed on reasonable grounds that the use of the sign in the manner in which it was used, or was to be used, was not an infringement of the registered trade mark.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 57ZB, I shall speak also to the other amendments in the grouping. Clause 86 of the Bill as it stands aims to tighten up the law against counterfeiting. Comments made during Second Reading and subsequently, however, have led the Government to believe that Clause 86 goes too far. As well as deliberate counterfeiters, it would also catch the person who
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
infringes a trade mark inadvertently. We have therefore tabled an amendment which replaces subsections (1) to (4) of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the amendment is therefore to focus the offence more directly on deliberate counterfeiting. Therefore the clause no longer proceeds by reference to "infringement", the inclusion of which would read into Clause 86 all the provisions of Clause 9 (which deals with the civil infringement of a registered trade mark), with a resulting considerable increase in the complexity of the offence to be proved. Moreover, it is proposed that the defence that the person charged believed on reasonable grounds that he was entitled to use the sign be substituted for the reference to belief that the use was licensed by the proprietor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also take the view that the reference to "similar" to a trade mark may be inappropriate, since it imports the notion of likelihood of confusion into this clause. As well as making the offence too broad, this could be difficult for a criminal court to handle. We therefore propose that this ought to be changed so as to require a test of degree of resemblance to the registered trade mark more stringent than merely confusion. Instead it should be something closer to deception of the customer. Therefore, we propose that the test should be that the sign is "likely to be mistaken for" the registered trade mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark is used on goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered, this is to be taken as amounting to deliberate counterfeiting. However, counterfeiters also attempt to exploit the reputation of well-known brands by, for example, putting trade marks which are famous for luxury goods, such as perfumes or cosmetics, onto garments. We propose therefore that, where the goods are not goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered, but the trade mark in question has such a reputation that use of the mark in this way would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark, that also should be caught by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also propose making the defence under this provision less restrictive. As drafted, subsection (5) of Clause 86 requires a person charged to have a reasonable belief that the use was licensed by the proprietor of the mark. Even if "licensed" is construed as simply meaning "permitted", the Government accept that this is a very restricted defence. We therefore propose replacing it by a requirement for a reasonable belief that the use was not an infringement. This would cover the use of someone acting in ignorance, or in a genuine belief that what he was doing did not require the consent of the proprietor, rather than taking part in deliberate counterfeiting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Government were able to table this amendment, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, tabled a series of amendments which also aim to improve Clause 86. The new amendments pre-empt them. I know that the noble and learned Lord cannot be with us today, but I understood him to have said that he was satisfied with the way in which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
Government have drafted this new amendment. I hope that it meets with the approval of the Committee. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some concern. The Minister ended by saying that he hoped that the amendment would meet with the approval of the Committee. I have to say that it does not meet with my approval. I have a double difficulty—if I may use that expression—because I believe that the amendments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, are closer to what is needed. I am unaware that he has said that he prefers the Minister's version to his. I certainly do not, as I shall explain in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must not use the noble and learned Lord as a defence for what I am doing. If I said that he preferred our amendments to what he was seeking to do, I was trying to make the point that I heard him say that he was quite satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall enlarge on what I said and we shall see how we go from there. First, perhaps I may agree with the Minister that the clause, as drafted, goes too far in one direction. In a way, it makes it too easy for the proprietor of the trade mark—or for the prosecution—to proceed in the way that he would want. As presented by the Minister, in my judgment the clause goes very much too far in the other direction in that it uses the word "fraudulently", which is a very strong word to use in this case. I gather that the technical expression that lawyers use is 	<i>mens rea</i> and I gather that this tightening up, which the noble and learned Lord seeks and with which I agree, goes too far in the other direction when it comes to 	<i>mens rea.</i> Therefore, the prosecution will find it very much harder to make its case. I have to ask the Minister who precisely is he trying to catch by this tightening up? Is he not making it too easy to plead that fraud was involved or intended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative reasonable grounds to an infringement and that sort of thing is what we have been using elsewhere in the Bill. To put it at its mildest, I am concerned that we are now using the word "fraudulently". In other words, I think that we have gone from one extreme to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I have a technical question on which I should like the Minister to comment. There does not seem to be an equivalent offence being written in to the Bill to deal with the use of a sign in relation to a service. The Minister is clearly aiming at counterfeited goods, but that becomes an anomaly given that the Bill is supposed to cover everything. I think that the Minister is right in trying to respond to some of the criticisms of Clause 86, but he has gone to the other extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My difficulty is that normally in a Committee such as this, when the Minister tables an amendment, I would not oppose it in the sense of wanting to vote against it because we are not proceeding in that way; we are proceeding by examining and thinking again. My difficulty is precisely that I wish to do that. I think that the attempts of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver,
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
to deal with this are nearer the mark. They need some fine tuning, and if he were here, I would have some questions for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end with a plea: does the Minister really need to press his amendment today? Under our rules, he does not because we could deal with the amendment on Report, which would give me and other members of the Committee time to explore it in much more detail. It would also give us time to examine more closely the amendments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, which will die otherwise. I understand that, if we carry the Minister's amendment today, we shall be breaking our rules if on Report we men tried to change it into a more middle-of-the-road position. That is another reason why I should like to ask the Minister whether he would be willing to delay this until we meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I am not asserting definitely that the Minister is wrong; I am asserting that this is a case where we need to mink the matter through a great deal more, especially given that we lack the presence of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver. I certainly lack his presence because I wanted to support his amendment. I put it bluntly to the Minister: would he bear with us to see whether we could deal with this on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two concerns about the new clause. If it lessens the ability to secure a prosecution, then I am not happy about it. I have been greatly concerned for many years about infringements of this nature relating to trade marks and particularly about counterfeiting. Anything that would allow a potential counterfeiter to get away with it would be disastrous. We have to toughen up our legislation to deter what is still a growing business. Whatever the country in which it happens, whoever handles the goods in this country or for whatever purpose, we should make counterfeiting more difficult. Although I have not been advised on—and nor have I looked up—the difference between infringement and fraud, I am happy enough to accept what the noble Lord, Lord Peston, says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether my noble friend the Minister can help us on a matter of procedure or whether we can have some guidance, if that is allowed, through the Chairman. It is my understanding that, were we to accept this amendment, we would still have an opportunity further to amend at later stages. I do not think that the passing of it blocks us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on my feet I should like to get some guidance on this. I would not want the Bill to leave the Committee in its current state because that is patently wrong so far as concerns this clause. It was complained of at Second Reading. The Government have acknowledged that and have made an attempt that very nearly meets the problem. But there is one area in which the problem is not met. I should like to see this moved on in the belief that the Government in the light of our discussion this morning, or any Member, can make an amendment at later stages in the House itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate further to pollute the air of tranquillity for which the Minister is calling in relation to his own amendment, but this amendment creates severe problems on the question of proof. I suspect, although I have not checked on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
matter, that the word "fraudulent" has crept in from another statute—perhaps in connection with trading standards. As my noble friend Lord Peston said, this is a very high standard to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made it clear that the Government feel that they are taking a very serious view of any breach of this piece of legislation. To make things unbearably difficult for the prosecution would be a retrograde step. The observations that have been made are underlined in particular in this clause because there is a stated defence to the offence in subsection (6). We do not have a straightforward prosecution for fraud, full stop. The defence has a stated statutory defence open to it to counter the allegations of the prosecution. Accordingly, I would support what my noble friend Lord Peston said in relation to the use of the word "fraudulent" and the standards it imposes. Of course, one does not want to make it too easy for the prosecution, but a balance has to be struck here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two words in subsection (6) to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. I refer to "show" in line 2 and "infringement" in the last line of the subsection. This is the stated defence to which I referred. I would suggest that the Minister might wish to consider whether this is too easy a defence and that "show" should be altered to "prove". In other words, it would be for the person who was contravening the legislation not just to show in a general way that he had reasonable grounds but he should prove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, I would suggest that consideration might be given to the possibility of including in the Bill the provision that, where a person intended to prove or show, whichever word remains, notice should be given to the prosecuting authorities of the manner in which he intends to show or prove that his was not an infringement of the Act. Otherwise, prosecutions will take place where a person will come in and say, "I am going to show"—let us take it at the lower standard -"why I did not contravene the Act", and then lead evidence, as I understand it, which the prosecution will not be in a position to counter at the time of proof. To give the prosecution and defence some degree of unity there should be an effort to tie the whole prosecution into one unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the use of the word "infringement", the Minister in terms stated that "infringement" would disappear from this clause—and indeed it has—but it creeps back in through subsection (6). Technically speaking, it should not be there because "infringement" has basically disappeared. If the Minister intends to take away this clause to consider it I should like to ask whether subsection (6) should not read,
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove",</p></blockquote>
that he was entitled to use the mark. That is short and simple compared with the convoluted formula which is presently contained in the Minister's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be reluctant—and my noble friend Lord Peston would be deeply reluctant—to see this amendment going through from this Committee to Report stage with the assumption being gathered by the rest of your Lordships' House that it floated through the Committee without any observations of quality being
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
made. I am asking the Minister to take note, as I am sure he will, of what has been said by other Members of the Committee. Perhaps he can take it away and reconstruct the provision, particularly subsection (6).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in an unusual difficulty with regard to the clause and the amendment in that I agree with everyone who has spoken so far, including both my noble friend Lord Peston and the Minister. My noble friend took exception to the use throughout the amendment of the word "fraudulent", which does not appear in the Bill. It is true that it does not appear in the Bill. However, if one looks at the marginal note one can see the word "fraudulent". I know that the marginal note is no more than a marginal note but it presumably indicates what the Government's intentions were. The Government's intentions were apparently to deal with fraud, although they could not say that in the original drafting of the Bill. That leaves us in something of a quandary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, said, that we can pass the amendment here and then deal with the matter by amendment, if appropriate, at the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may help the Committee. Our rules are that we cannot overturn at Report stage an amendment agreed at Committee stage. That means in practice that we cannot drastically amend an amendment, which would then be interpreted as the equivalent of overturning it. Therefore, all we are able to do is to make minor adjustments to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objections are not minor. They are major. They may turn out not to be objections when I have had a chance to look into the situation. But the point that I have to make to my noble friend is that my objections—he may have misunderstood the strength of my objections—would be the equivalent of overturning the amendment at this stage. Therefore our colleagues, when we get back to our normal Chamber, would object. That is why I ask the Minister to take the amendment away. That does not mean that he will lose it. There is no danger of that. It means that we would be able to look at it a little more. I am sorry to have interrupted my noble friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have been interrupted by my noble friend. It has happened before and it will no doubt happen again. I am grateful to him for that explanation. There is really no difference between us in this matter. When I said that we could cope with the amendment at Report stage I did not mean that we should overturn it. I meant that we could amend it. The difference between us lies in the words "drastically amend". It may be that I misunderstood him at least to that extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I am now inclining more strongly towards my noble friend on the basis of his intervention. There are clear misgivings about the amendment. It seems to me that perhaps the best thing for the Minister to do would be to withdraw it. There is no rule against the Minister withdrawing his own amendment. He could bring it back at Report stage after

	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
taking into consideration the comments of my noble friend Lord Peston and perhaps after further discussion with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry about sending the Bill through amended to be dealt with at Report stage does not arise from the procedural difficulties but from the nature of the Report stage; that is, that we would be dealing then with a discussion on detailed matters in the Whole House. In the nature of things, if this amendment came before the House on Report in some form, and it was taken to a Division, it would be decided by a potential number of Members who were not party to the discussion. Some few would be present in the Chamber, I have no doubt, but many others would appear at the command of the Bell and would vote according to their inclinations, perhaps following their companions through the Lobby, without really having heard the discussion. They would be guided perhaps by the fact that this Committee, having heard the discussion, had passed the Bill as amended. I am sure that the way out of our dilemma would be for the Minister to withdraw this amendment and come back with something at Report stage. That would make me happy because I would then remain in agreement with both him and my noble friend, and that is how I like things to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Monson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is mistaken in thinking that we cannot amend drastically at Report, or indeed Third Reading, an amendment made in Committee. I seem to remember that happening on numerous occasions over the past 25 years or more. I am glad that the Government think that Clause 86 as drafted goes too far, because that was certainly my impression as a complete layman when reading it through yesterday. Every young person I know who has been on a round-the-world trip before going up to university, or indeed while at university, has come back from South-East Asia, or possibly other parts of Asia, with armfuls of fake Lacoste sports shirts and the odd fake Rolex watch or two, and a number of other fake branded goods. That is very naughty of them no doubt, but it has been going on for a long time and I do not think the manufacturers of the genuine articles have been bankrupted in consequence, or even seriously inconvenienced. Let us suppose that one of these young people then decides, during the summer vacation perhaps, that he has one or two fake shirts surplus to his requirements and he decides to put them in a car boot sale. It seems to me that as the clause stands he or she could find himself liable to 10 years' imprisonment, if convicted on indictment, which does seem to me a trifle draconian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not yet worked out whether the amendment suggested by the Government would make such a conviction impossible, but I would guess it probably would in so far as anyone who bought a so-called Lacoste shirt or Rolex watch at a car boot sale would almost certainly guess it was a fake. However, I shall be interested to hear the Government's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Baroness Hooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, would welcome guidance from the Lord Chairman, and indeed any further guidance that my noble friend the Minister wishes to offer as regards the situation that arises if we pass this amendment. I am bound to say that my own feeling is that there would be nothing to prevent further amendment, even considerable amendment, at a later stage. Certainly it seems to me that the most important point is that there should be more discussion at a later stage, because today it is unfortunate that not only have we not had much time to consider this particular amendment but we are missing the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who are two of the very active Members of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 86 is extremely important and has introduced, both in its scope and its severity, some matters which have caused concern. After all, it goes a long way further than the comparable provision in the 1988 Act—or certainly the original clause did—and introduces for the first time into intellectual property law the concept of an absolute offence. Therefore it is a matter which deserves considerable scrutiny. I would certainly be sorry if it was suggested that there was no further scope for discussion and amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of points have already been made in relation to the amendment. While I recognise that my noble friend the Minister has intended to lessen the scope of the original clause in introducing his amendment, there is still the matter of the requirement of 	<i>mens rea</i> to which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred. That issue still remains absent from Clause 86(1). Even the words that appear in Clause 86(2)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowing or having reason to believe"—</p></blockquote>
which, I should have thought, could well have been introduced into subsection (1), are not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak so that my noble friend the Minister may know the feeling of many Members of this Committee before he replies. I echo the words of my noble friend Lady Hooper, and I hope that the Minister will take note of her words. It would be a dreadful pity if, right at this last stage, we showed any signs of diversity in this Committee where there has been an enormous degree of unanimity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Reay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my noble friend the Minister will not be persuaded to retreat too far by other Members of the Committee. My noble friend has listened to representations, particularly on the grounds that the Bill as it is drafted was set too wide and would have caught the innocent. I am grateful for that. I think the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to gain"—</p></blockquote>
that is replaced by the word "fradulent"—was one of the phrases that would have caught the innocent. I would prefer the word "fraudulent". I hope that this amendment will be adopted by us today without necessarily any further discussion at Report stage being excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I may delay the proceedings by 10 seconds or so. It seemed to me that "fradulent" might be a fairly strong term to use. However, when I looked at subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
recognised that at least this provided a basis for going to court. I very much appreciated hearing the thoughts of the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, on subsection (6). I hope I am right in thinking that if this amendment is taken today the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver, might have a chance to put forward one or two of his amendments at Report stage. When we reach Report stage all our comments will have to be carefully selected as we have the chance to speak only once. Possibly that is a benefit. Certainly I feel that my noble friend has made, with this amendment, an excellent stab at clearing up some doubts on Clause 86. I hope that our proceedings would not be unduly troubled at Report stage if further discussions needed to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise in some trepidation to join this debate and to try to round it off. I feel rather as if I have been mugged. I accuse the noble Lord, Lord Peston, of being the chief mugger as he has raised one or two important issues. The first one is a procedural issue which I wish to deal with briefly and the other issues are of greater substance and I shall have to deal with those too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has a great deal of procedural experience in the Chamber and I see ranged next to me four previous Ministers who have taken legislation through the House. All those sitting on the other side are also experienced in dealing with legislation. I have never read a great deal into the fact that an amendment moved in Committee cannot be amended on Report. Of course they can. There are dozens of instances where amendments have been approved in Committee and then amended not only on Report but on Third Reading. That happens time and time again and so it should continue. There is no chance that, if the Committee approves the amendment, there will be no opportunity to discuss it in some detail or to amend it at later stages. Perhaps at that time we can use the expert wisdom of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oliver. No, to say that the amendment if approved today is unamendable, is not stating what I believe to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if we do not carry the amendment, what are we left with? We are left with the Bill as originally drafted and which we all agree is wrong. It was not as though the Government woke up one morning and decided to amend Clause 86. That has been done only after exhaustive consultation with those who have interests in this issue and after a great deal of discussion. We came to the view that the clause as drafted was inappropriate and on that basis we have brought forward these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has not had time to read my amendment thoroughly. Perhaps he has not received advice upon it. I do not blame him for that because the Bill is complicated. Perhaps I have not explained my intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to comment on some of the issues of substance now that I have dealt with the procedural aspects. First, there are no absolute offences introduced under the amendment just as there was none in the earlier draft. That point was raised by my noble friend Lady Hooper. Subsection (4) defines the word "fraudulently".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
Subsection (6) contains the 	<i>mens rea</i> defence. That was realised by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay. The words "believed on reasonable grounds" imports the 	<i>mens rea</i> test about which the noble Lord is concerned. The noble Lord wondered about the word "show" which appears in that subsection. I understand that the word "show" is equivalent to the word "prove", and therefore mere is no problem in understanding what is required by the word "show". In addition, subsection (3) refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowing or having reason to believe".</p></blockquote>
That means that we have also included a 	<i>mens rea</i> element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to subsection (6) and the use of the word "infringement". As far as I am concerned, the use of the word "infringement" is quite proper in subsection (6) because it refers to elements of offences which are infringements, which have now been set out in new subsections (1) to (3). An infringement is broader in scope than the offence under this clause. Moreover, the two ingredients in subsection (4) were in the original version of Clause 86. They are not new but they are grouped under "fraudulently" which is now defined by the reference to these two ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be churlish about this matter. Noble Lords opposite may not agree with me about my definitions and soon but all the points I have raised are eminently amendable at Report stage. Having made that commitment to the Committee, the way I think it best to proceed is to agree my amendment on the basis that there may be still some areas which we need to look at again. We have the time between now and Report to decide what might be done. We have the opportunity at Report to amend and we have the opportunity at Third Reading to amend. If we do not take the opportunity today to accept the amendment, we simply reduce our ability to amend it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to prolong this but it is a very important matter. It is not my intention to mug the Minister. My intention is to improve the Bill. On procedure, as I understand it—it is certainly my experience—we cannot overturn an amendment agreed in Committee. On more than one occasion I have attempted to amend an amendment, which we can do, and then been told, "I am sorry, that amendment is no good because it is the equivalent of overturning an amendment agreed in Committee".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My belief—and this matter will not be decided by either the noble Lord the Minister or me - is that if, after further thought, I feel—as I do at present—that "fraudulently" is wrong, removing that word and reinserting the different standard of proof will be judged by the clerks as the equivalent of overturning the amendment. That is the nature of my problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my opening remarks, I am with the Minister in wanting to change the clause. I am with the Minister in wanting to go in the direction in which he wants to go. My central point which remains is that he goes too far in the other direction. What he is doing is too damaging to the interests of the proprietor of the trade mark. The noble Lords, Lord Reay and Lord
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
Monson, were clear on their view of the matter but they are judging it in a different way. I feel that we are going too far the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have conducted the Committee in an admirable way. We can go back to our colleagues and say that this justifies the use of this kind of procedure for dealing with matters of this kind. The reason I make my plea to the Minister is not to be regarded as backing down. For all I know, when we come to Report I might say that I do not agree with the amendment and he would be right to say that there is no more time. That is my point—I do need more time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that it is no loss of faith to the Minister or to his department. He should give us a chance to do the job properly and to get this right. I make my plea for the last time—the Minister will not hear from me again—and ask him not to move his amendment. I assure him that I shall deal with it on Report perfectly correctly. He will have no difficulty if he needs to carry the amendment. I wish that he would not try to carry it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Monson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with the suggestion put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is that any amendment brought forward on Report may still require further amendment when Members of the House, as it will then be, have given thought to it. It is not considered "the right thing to do" to make a lot of amendments at Third Reading. That is the only effective way in which it can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might not the Minister welcome the opportunity to take this back now and bring forward an amendment on Report with the object of tidying up subsections (2) and (3). Subsection (2) provides that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person commits an offence who fraudulently",</p></blockquote>
does what is described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). Subsection (3) provides that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person commits an offence who fraudulently",</p></blockquote>
does what is described in paragraphs (a) and (b). What purpose is served by having two subsections beginning with the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person commits an offence who fraudulently"?</p></blockquote>
Why not on Report put subsections (2) and (3) into one subsection instead of pursuing in Committee an amendment whose drafting is not perfect, to say the least?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston. I understand his anxieties. The point that I am trying to make is two-fold. Perhaps I may first deal with the procedural matter. I know that ultimately it will not be our decision but I do not believe that we are changing the original drafting so substantially that the noble Lord will not be able to come back on Report with substantial amendments if he feels that that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord said that "fraudulent" brings in a new concept and a new meaning. It does not because it is not different from the earlier draft. In the original Clause 86, we see the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to gain for himself or another".</p></blockquote>
That is in the Bill as originally drafted and—I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Howie, who mentioned it—with the word "fraudulent" in the margin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
The noble Lord, Lord Airedale, asked why we have these two subsections when they deal with two very different things. That is why they have been drafted in that way. That is the problem. It comes back to how we are going to deal with this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to be churlish to the noble Lord, Lord Peston. There are many things that I have agreed to consider already in the course of the Committee stage. In order to go forward, I believe that we ought to have this on the Bill, to be discussed at Report stage; otherwise, we are simply going to repeat exactly the same discussion that we are having today. I do not feel that that will be to the benefit of anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to have a new clause on the face of the Bill which can be amended. I have looked at the relevant provisions and the Rules of the House, and I cannot see anything mere which excludes substantial redrafting by the House on this section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless anybody else has anything to say, perhaps I may leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howie of Troon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief. The Minister has been extremely accommodating throughout the procedure of this Committee and has undertaken to look virtually at everything that has been put to him. I am not quite sure what that means in practice and what will come out of it. I am sure that it will be something that we all desire up to a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I just wonder what the Minister is telling us at the moment. Is he saying that, if the amendment is passed at this stage and the Bill comes forward amended at Report stage, and if other amendments are tabled to it, he will behave in the manner in which Ministers normally behave; namely, he will resist them? Or is he saying that he will not in fact resist them and he will consider them at Report stage? Those are rhetorical questions. I do not want to put any thoughts into the Minister's head. Is he perhaps saying that, if this amendment is accepted today and goes through, he will then reconsider any propositions which are put to him between now and Report stage and perhaps put down amendments of his own should he believe that the representations are sound? I am not sure that I expect him to answer that question either, though it is less rhetorical than the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish by saying that I agree with the Minister's interpretation of a Report stage. I feel that my noble friend is making rather heavy weather of the matter. I think that we could get round it. I know that he is very experienced on the Front Bench. But I will say that there is more to this matter than the Rules; there are the customs of the House. I can recall during the passing of the Coal Bill earlier this year that I rose in the Chamber to make a proposition not unlike the one we have had today; namely, that the Government should accept an amendment which was thought to be not wholly satisfactory, with a view to amending the amendment at Report stage. That extremely sensible proposition was immediately seized by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpehter, who informed me in the brisk manner to which he is accustomed that I was—well, he did not actually use the word "idiot" but I think that was what he meant. He indicated that that is not how the House
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
proceeds; that is to say, the Government do not accept amendments with a view to their being amended later on. We are caught here today in that cleft stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to tell me that, if this is accepted, he would be open to putting down amendments himself, or at any rate accepting sensible amendments if they were tabled, on the basis of discussions which will certainly take place between now and Report stage. I hope that my comments are helpful to the Minister and to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend the Minister is quite able to answer for himself and no doubt he will should he feel it necessary. However, the noble Lord, Lord Howie, puts us in an impossible position. On the one hand, he is holding a weapon (if not a gun) at our heads by the use of rhetorical questions which say "if, "and", "the other" and "so such and such can go forward"; yet if those things do not happen at Report stage, then he will say, "Oh, we were misled".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put this point to the noble Lord. I believe that in fact mere is another remedy at Report. Anybody can table an amendment which has bearing on the subject matters discussed and at the same time can move a Motion for recommittal. That has been done. It is very unusual and probably is frowned upon by the authorities, but it has been done. Indeed, some years ago I suffered at the hands of noble friends of the noble Lord, Lord Peston. I know that it can happen and there is that remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on further consideration, the noble Lord, Lord Peston, or other Members of the Committee who have some doubts about the phraseology and this one word have further discussions and the Government may or may not agree, then we can go forward. If not, it is a straightforward matter. I do not see that further discussion here will bring us any nearer a solution. Like my noble friend Lord Reay, I would say that the Government have given way so far. There are one or two small aspects that I do not like. But in the years that I have been in your Lordships' House, I have been taught and have learned that if the Government give anything at all toward my argument, I take it. I believe that there is a grave risk of losing the lot if we fail to accept this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Macaulay of Bragar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that those of us who want to consider the position between this stage and the Report stage can understand the thinking behind the use of the word "fraudulent". I wonder whether the Minister could at this or at a later stage perhaps explain the mechanics of how "fraudulent" has jumped from a side note into the substantive part of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at the original Bill, we see that the only time that the word "fraudulent" appears is in a side note at Clause 86 and the side note is merely interpreting what the clause is meant to deal with. I do not see the word "fraudulent" in Clause 86 at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Bill originally constituted was an absolute defence—an absolute statutory offence and a statutory defence. What apparently the amendment now does it to put the word "fraudulent" into the Bill on four different occasions by Amendment No. 57ZB and to clutter up the presentation of prosecutions with a legal concept
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
which has already been dealt with by my noble friend Lord Peston. With respect, the transposition of "fraudulent" from the side note to the substance of the Bill would appear to me to be an absolutely unnecessary step to take. Perhaps the Minister, either now or at a later stage, could indicate to the Committee the thinking behind the use of that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the way the noble Lord sprang to the defence of his noble friend over those questions. Naturally they need to be answered. I think that I have already answered them but I am quite happy to go over the ground again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may first deal with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon. He asked a number of questions and set out a number of possible situations. As my noble friend Lord Lucas explained, this is a non-party political Bill and is generally non-contentious. It seems extraordinary that we should come to such a situation over this amendment, however difficult the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my first reply, the Government did not think up this change overnight. It was put forward after a great deal of detailed discussion and I would be very surprised if those whom we consulted had changed their minds. I am more than happy to involve myself in consultation not just with people outside but with the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar—and if the noble Lord, Lord Howie, wants to come along too he would be welcome—in order to sort out these matters of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Peston, said that by putting in the word "fraudulent" we had substantially changed the meaning of the original clause. I would argue that we have not. With the words we have used,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to gain for himself or another, or with intent to cause loss to another",</p></blockquote>
it is really another way of saying "acts fraudulently". We then go on to explain in subsection (4) what "fraudulently" means by using exactly those words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to gain for himself or another".</p></blockquote>
I suspect it boils down to disagreement about the way in which the clause has been drafted. If that is the case, there is no argument about substance and there is no way in which we could find ourselves unable to amend the Bill at Report stage. I repeat the plea for us to get on with the Bill as fast as we can and to go on to another subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 97 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I apologise for not giving the Chair notice. I was not aware of the rules of procedure of this Committee. However, I have given the Minister notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to Clause 97(3) and (4). In the case of subsection (3) it seems to me unnecessary and that, 	<i>ipso facto,</i> that would happen. In any form of law, whether in normal running or bankruptcy proceedings, that is where a fine would lie. Secondly, with regard to subsection (4) I find the wording curious and I wonder what it means when in lines 7 and 8 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to prevent the commission of the offence, is also guilty of the offence and liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly".</p></blockquote>
That seems an extraordinary juxtaposition of phrases. If someone has been found guilty he is not liable to be proceeded against. I am also not sure what is meant by "and punished accordingly". Are we talking about extra damages or the American habit of penal levies and so forth? The second half of that subsection appears to be a bit of a mess. In addition, subsection (3) appears to be unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again I am grateful to my noble friend for bringing this matter to our attention. He brings his great skill to these matters and I hope that the Committee understands what my noble friend says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 97(3) shows that it is necessary to deal with the question of how, or out of what funds, a fine is to be paid where a court finds an offence has been committed by a partnership (for example, pursuant to Clause 80) rather than how it is to be paid by a partner who will be liable personally for any fine imposed upon him. That subsection states what the position is to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend says that in Clause 97(4) there is a strange juxtaposition. Where a partnership is found guilty of an offence, it is correct to say that subsection (4) imputes the offence to all the partners also. This reflects the nature of a partnership and the responsibilities partners bear under laws governing partnerships. However, that may not follow where the partner can prove ignorance of the offence or where the partner has attempted to prevent it. Otherwise, the partner's liability is in addition to that of the partnership and the partner may also be proceeded against and fined in addition to the partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that resolves the queries raised by my noble friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend the Minister for his words. I shall study them carefully. I do not believe that either of those two points matters too much, but I am not totally convinced by his answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Airedale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it ever necessary to write into any statute that a person who commits an offence is liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly? I thought that we all knew that without it being specified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the noble Lord has a very good point. It is of course a drafting exercise. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
have been presented with a draft and I tend to accept it, not having the noble Lord's skills. Perhaps I may consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Clause 97 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 98 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 99 [	<i>Minor definitions</i>]:</p>
	<p>[	<i>Amendment No. 58 not moved.</i>]</p>
	<p>Clauses 99 to 101 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Schedule 3 [	<i>Transitional provisions</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 59:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 53, line 43, leave out sub-paragraph (2).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 causes applications for registration which were filed before the Bill comes into force to be dealt with under the present law. The subsequent sub-paragraphs make exceptions to that principle. In particular, sub-paragraph (2) causes Clause 63 of the Bill to apply to applications which are pending on commencement. That provision makes the files on applications open to public inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted representations that it would be wrong to apply this new rule to applications already in being. It would be particularly unfair to those applicants who had filed evidence or other material before commencement in the expectation that it would not be open to inspection. Accordingly, the amendment omits sub-paragraph (2). I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 60:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 53, line 46, leave out sub-paragraph (3) and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(3) The power of the Secretary of State under section 73 of this Act to make rules regulating practice and procedure, and as to the matters mentioned in subsection (2) of that section, is exercisable in relation to such an application; and different provision may be made for such applications from that made for other applications.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: At present, opposition to the registration of a trade mark may be filed within one month of the application being advertised; however, that period is extendible. The intention under the new law is to provide, in the rules, for a non-extendible period of three months for filing oppositions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10(3) as it stands, would have achieved only part of that aim in regard to applications pending on commencement. It would have the effect of depriving them of the possibility of extension, while making them subject to the one-month opposition period. Amendment No. 60, which replaces paragraph 10(3), will enable the rules to be drawn up under Clause 73 to be applied to those applications for registration under the current law and pending when the Bill comes into force, so that they are treated on the same basis as applications under the Bill. The amendment and the subsequent rules will ensure equitable treatment for all the interested parties. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Schedule 3, as amended, shall be the third schedule of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to Schedule 3, I wish to put a simple question, as a layman, which probably has a simple answer. On Schedule 3, paragraphs 2(3) and 3(1), I simply ask, why? In both
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
cases it is notes which, in the old Act, were registered and the intention is not carry them forward. I do not see the logical reason for that intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend makes a point which I had not foreseen, although he certainly gave notice that he intended to raise the query. Perhaps I can write to him and explain to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of courtesy I thank my noble friend. I believe I warned him of my intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Schedule 3, as amended, agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 102 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Schedule 4 [	<i>Consequential amendments</i>]:</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 61:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 59, line 48, leave out from first ("the") to ("and") in line 50 and insert ("registrar under Schedule 1 or 2 to the Trade Marks Act 1994,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I have already spoken to Amendment No. 61. However, as it is the last amendment in the Marshalled List, I should like to say one or two words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first time that I have been involved in a Committee stage under the special procedure. I believe it has been extremely successful and I thank all those who attended the proceedings so regularly. I thank also those responsible in the House authorities for making sure that we could hear each other and for ensuring that various papers were available so speedily. I believe that this is the kind of system we should use on a great many more Bills. I particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for the extremely helpful way in which he dealt with many of the amendments we tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to Amendment No. 61 when moving a previous amendment. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Peston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too wish to take the opportunity to echo the remarks of the noble Lord, despite our differences on Amendment No. 57ZB, which I fear will come back within a week or two. I too strongly believe and would like to go on record as saying that a Committee of this kind is the ideal way of dealing with many Bills. I congratulate all my colleagues—if I may use that word—on demonstrating that this kind of system can work so that we can deal with matters with, in my view, not a word on party politics being put forward, for which there was no need. More use of this system would add to the efficiency of your Lordship's Chamber and to the efficiency of the legal process. I therefore wish to go on record as supporting what was said by the noble Lord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Schedule 4, as amended, agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 103 agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause 104 [	<i>Extent</i>]:</p>
	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 104 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Earl of Harrowby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is certainly my last question in the proceedings and I wish to echo some of the earlier remarks. In particular I thank my noble friend the Minister for the erudite way in which he handled the business. As a newcomer to this Chamber, I was immensely impressed by the knowledge of some of the Ministers, who have to cover considerable ground. It is something that people outside the Chamber should be well aware of—one wishes that they were more aware of it. In particular I thank him for the good humour with which he dealt with the matters before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question is extremely simple and I am sure that it can be answered in one word. Are the Channel Islands included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Strathclyde</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not apply to the Channel Islands. Perhaps I can explain what happens. The Channel Islands have their own trade marks legislation. They are responsible for registration of marks under it. However, it is worth noting that the Channel Islands—Jersey and Guernsey, whose legislation also covers Alderney and Sark—re-register UK trade marks. They therefore accept UK registered trade marks and place them on their own register without carrying out a further examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is the kind of full reply with which I could have answered my noble friend on many previous occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
