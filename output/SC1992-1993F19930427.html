	<i>Amendment proposed [22 April]:</i> No. 27, in page 3, line 27, after the word "and", to insert the words "large and small".—[
	<i>Mr. Ainger.</i>]</p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are discussing also amendment No. 95, in page 3, line 27, after second "milk", insert ", in particular small producers".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify to what extent, in approving a scheme of reorganisation, the Minister will require Milk Marque to be the buyer of last resort? I ask that only because some fanners believe—however mistakenly—that their milk will not be collected. Will the Minister give his assurance that he will try to extract undertakings from Milk Marque in those areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not be too worried about that because, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have said from the outset, we are short of milk. There is no possibility that milk will go uncollected, which was the great fear during the 1930s, and which led to the establishment of the milk marketing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual dairy companies, the processors that are in the market for milk, Milk Marque and the equivalent organisation in Scotland will not encounter problems with milk collection. They may have to think about issues such as haulage charges or alternative-day collection, but I do not think that any dairy farmer needs to worry that his milk will not be collected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify one other item? That is, the expenditure that will be incurred by producers who think it necessary to change their tank arrangements. Will they receive any assistance? I am not thinking of a grant, but, perhaps, the Government have in mind some skew-whiff scheme whereby farmers will be able to purchase alternative equipment on reduced credit terms to provide for two-day collection or, perhaps, even three-day collection. We do not know what the future holds. I understand that in Holland there is a three-day collection system. Will there be any help to ease the path of producers in remote areas who may find it difficult to raise finance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always especially sympathetic to small producers. Of course, "small" has
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
changed over the years. I started dairying with 50 cows and would now be considered to be a small producer. Farmers with small herds are relatively few and far between nowadays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a hypothetical question. We cannot contemplate what commercial arrangements will be made in a year's time between Milk Marque and whatever other bodies have evolved. We shall have to wait and see, but I am confident that the collection of milk will present no problems. Indeed, I think that people will be queueing to collect the milk of individual farmers, who may then be more advantageously placed than they are now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Marland 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gloucestershire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 3, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) whether the scheme makes sound provision for settlement of disputes between a successor body and its customers;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 75, in page 3, fine 48, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In subsection (4)(aa) above 'successor body' means a body to which property, rights or liabilities of a milk marketing board are, under the scheme to which the application relates, proposed to be transferred under section 10 below.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of our objectives is to ensure that fair play persists. We want to ensure that our work in Committee and the legislation that we endorse will stand the test of time and that there will be a level playing field. People do not like that expression, but I think that it accurately describes what we want to see occur as a result of the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea behind the Bill is to free the markets. If there is to be one, dominant co-operative we must spend time considering how disputes with that co-operative can be resolved. We want to ensure that a co-operative in a strong position will not over-exploit the situation at the expense of others. Equally, we want to ensure that a dominant co-operative will not be overcome with lethargy and will make every effort to get the best price for the milk that its members produce. It should be easy for everyone to add value to the raw material that he produces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of disputes with the milk marketing board, which is in a dominant position. We must spend time deciding whether there is a way in which we could accelerate the hearing and resolution of difficulties. If there were disputes, the milk purchaser might find himself unable to source his milk needs from elsewhere and would, therefore, be exploited by the dominant co-operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resorting to the courts is the ultimate solution available to everyone, but it is time consuming and extremely costly, as any of us know who have had the misfortune to go to court. Reading the agricultural press, we learn that groups of farmers are forming themselves into co-operatives. I tore an article from the 
	<i>Farmers Weekly</i> which mentions the Red Rose Farmers, a Lancashire-based group of 36 farmers, who are getting together to add value to the milk that they are producing. We want to ensure that there are as few obstacles and difficulties put in the way of such groups as possible. If they do get into difficulties, we want to ensure that they,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
and any other producer retailers, are given a smooth path forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of amendment No. 73 is to ensure that there would be a speedy settlement of any dispute that might arise with a dominant co-operative. I want to emphasise that the dominant co-operative, whether it be a broker, a merchant or a large-scale manufacturer that is able to offer attractive short or long-term conditions might squeeze others out of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take up the point made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) about small producers because that is on the minds of many dairy farmers. If they believe that there could be a way quickly to resolve a dispute with a co-operative, that solution would be a useful addition to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 would set out precisely what is meant by a successor body. As I have said, we want to ensure that there will be no grey legislative area so that those affected by the Bill will be confident there is a way in which their disputes could be heard quickly and at minimal expense. I hope that the Committee will consider the amendments favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly to tell the Minister that it would be interesting to hear what the Government think before I support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We debated the issue during a previous sitting, when the hon. Member for Workington tabled amendments which would have had the same effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was that a challenge to the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be suggesting that we should not debate the amendment because we have already debated the issue that arises from it That suggests, Mr. Hill, that you were remiss in selecting the amendment. I am sure that you were not and that the Minister has no right to make such comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman should remember that he is in the Agriculture Committee, not in the Select Committee on Defence. Perhaps he could get back into his butter mode rather than his guns mode. I said that we had already discussed the issue. I could discuss it until the cows come home, to continue the analogy, it the hon. Gentleman wants. I do not think that any other Member would want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim is not to create a surrogate milk marketing board. By putting an organisation into the private sector, we are expecting the disciplines and the customs of the private sector to operate, so we do not intend to require the board to bring forward proposals which incorporate a special disputes procedure. That should properly be left to the marketplace, as happens with other companies in the private sector. I understand the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West and that
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
we are moving from a highly managed system to one in which the board will enjoy greter freedom under the aegis of competition laws, but I do not think that the issue should be singled out for particular attention. I hope that my hon. Friend understands that the competition rules will be brought to bear and that there will, undoubtedly, be sharp surveillance of the board's operations. The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) and I have agreed, along, I think, with the entire Committee, that the decisive factor is not so much that the board has a dominant position but the methods it uses and how it behaves. The board will know that it is under surveillance during the initial period. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West understands why I cannot accept his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Government's attitude to this issue unreasonable. I am supported by those who, as I said before, are responsible for £2.5 billion-worth of milk trade in the United Kingdom and who, almost universally, believe that what is happening is wrong. They have repeatedly suggested the need for a disputes procedure. I do not know whether Conservative Members who have not spoken share that view—they must have an opinion because we have all received information. I am not asking hon. Members to delay proceedings, but I am prepared to resume my seat to allow other hon. Members to express what they know must be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, and if all the mechanisms are operating correctly in a free market, the courts, the Commission and the Office of Fair Trading should be able to deal with any problems. The difficulty is that this is not a free market in the normal sense. It is a free market in which 80 or 90 per cent, of milk supply may well be dominated by one supplier. That is what makes the market so different and what makes it critical that there be some mechanism to ensure that decisions can be taken fairly rapidly to sort out problems with the milk supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minster rightly said that the issue was raised when we discussed a previous amendment, but it will not go away—it will return on Report. Every day, we receive correspondence from the processing industry stating that it is dissatisfied and that the Government must take action—that underlines its concerns about the issues of consultation and of how to resolve disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment on an interesting statement made by the MMB when the issue was discussed in the House of Lords. I do not want to show disrespect, but I think that the new market was described in almost arrogant terms. I do not think that the board understands what will happen. It commented:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the freemarket, prices will be determined by interplay of the forces of supply and demand There will be free bargaining between buyers and sellers. There will be no 'continuity' in the sense of preferred access to milk for existing purchasers, as the existing milk marketing scheme provides. 'Continuity' is therefore not a concept or a factor relevant to Clause 2(c).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Similarly, 'means of settling a dispute' would enshrine an out-dated concept"—</p></blockquote>
an "out-dated concept" in a market where 80 per cent, or 90 per cent, is dominated by one organisation—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"utterly inappropriate to the free market in milk. In the free market, disputes will be settled between the parties or by the courts, just as in any other industry or by any arbitration the parties may agree to use."</p></blockquote>
I shall return to that subject in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the MMB could point me to other industries where the supply of the product is dominated by one firm that controls 80 or 90 per cent, of the market. I cannot think of any such examples, but perhaps I am wrong and being silly. Perhaps the Minister will tell me where such practice goes on. Were he to produce an example, my judgment might be influenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MMB also observed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no compulsory arbitration on prices, or sales conditions, as under the current statutory regime."</p></blockquote>
That statement is arrogant because it fails to take into account the concerns of the many people who are worried about what might happen in the market. What sort of disputes could arise? I—and, indeed, any rational person in the industry—can foresee circumstances in which there might be an unreasonable refusal to supply. The milk manager in a particular area of Milk Marque would be in a strong position. Contract poaching by Milk Marque or even perhaps, by the processors, who will go on direct contract—I presume that there will be some poaching in the marketplace—should be subject to some ground rules. There could be predatory pricing to drive up the price of milk. We still do not know what will happen to assets, although I must say that the Minister's speech the other day was interesting. I was glad to note that he may be pointing in the same direction as the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as we do not know what will happen to assets, there might be disputes over the assets being used as a marketing tool. What forum will there be to discuss and resolve such disputes. I cannot see that such a forum exists. On Second Reading, I asked the Secretary of State whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has ruled out an arbitration procedure on price in the deregulated milk market".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In advance of the boards' proposals, I would not like to say that I have ruled out anything of that sort, but I see no role at the moment for further statutory interference in the way in which the market will operate. I shall certainly not be dogmatic, as I am not a dogmatic person".</p></blockquote>

	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—there seem to be louder laughs from Conservative members of the Committee than from Opposition members about that observation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but I would not want to suggest to anyone that I have that high on my list of priorities and I do not think that I should be led down that route, although the hon. Gentleman may be able to change my mind."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 March 1993; Vol. 221, 
	<i>c.</i> 793.]</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I shall be able to change the Secretary of State's mind. I understand that the Secretary of State is very busy at the moment in Luxembourg, where, I hope, he is holding up the flag for the United Kingdom in negotiations on potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened in the past few weeks since 23 March to make the Government decide that they are not prepared to intervene? The Secretary of State thought that I might be able to change his mind. Why have the Government become so rigid on this matter that they cannot see any room for an arbitration procedure or a regulator?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether this Unigate document was forwarded to all members of the Committee, but its
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
comments may be relevant to our proceedings. It refers to the MMB's sale conditions, which were agreed by the joint committee. Part 1 covers general conditions, which were effective from and adopted on 1 May 1991. Unigate stated of arbitration that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"believes there is a simpler approach which would satisfy its concerns, ie.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Compulsory arbitration between individual purchasers/buyers of milk and Milk Marque, if a dispute were to arise which could not be resolved in any other way.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The MMB sales conditions currently provide for this type of arbitration between an individual buyer and the MMB (with the parties deciding on their own arbitrator).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Existence of this arrangement is not as well known as the arrangements under the Milk Marketing Scheme, for arbitration between the MMB and buyers collectively via the DTF, and its continuance under Milk Marque would address the concerns felt by Unigate and other buyers."</p></blockquote>
Rule 30 on arbitration states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any question or difference shall arise out of, or in connection with, any transaction under the Sale Contract of these Sale Conditions, or as to the construction thereof, (except as otherwise provided in Clause 3 hereof) the same shall be referred to an arbitrator or be agreed between the Board and the Buyer, or, at the Buyer's option, to an arbitrator appointed by the Joint Committee; and if the Board and the Buyer or the Joint Committee cannot agree the arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of the Law Society. The Arbitration Acts 1950 and 1979 as amended or consolidated by any subsequent enactment shall apply to every arbitration consequent on a reference under this clause."</p></blockquote>
A procedure exists under a statutory arrangement. The MMB refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any arbitration the parties may agree to use".</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether that arrangement could be carried forward and whether rule 30 of the board's sale conditions could surface as a disputes procedure under a scheme that the Minister is required to consider. Could that be developed as an arrangement to be used as a mechanism for sorting out difficulties? The Minister may say that that is up to Milk Marque and its clients. But the rules establishing Milk Marque must be approved by Ministers, and the scheme must be approved by Ministers, so surely the Minister has some influence over such an arbitration scheme. Would it be possible to include that in a scheme of reorganisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers should not ignore the concerns, which are being expressed by many organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall intervene only briefly because we want to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response to the original proposition of the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West betrayed some complacency which is not felt by all Conservative Members and is certainly not felt in the agricultural community at large. The problem of possible disputes should be considered but we should be careful to identify whether we are concerned with disputes during the transitional period or interregnum, or whether we are principally concerned with post-vesting day. I suspect that most anxiety at present concerns the transition, and rightly so. We intend to move from a highly managed market to one with more flexibility and freedom. That always causes anxiety in any walk of life or industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect also that those who are most likely to be worried are those who are currently dealing with the board but anticipate that at some stage they may not want to deal with the Milk Marque. Again, it is difficult to make provision in advance for those people because the situation will be very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
I understand the thought behind the amendment, but I am concerned that it might be misdirected. The amendment would not deal with either of the circumstances to which I have referred. It would relate principally to those who, post-vesting day, continue to be customers of the board and who deal regularly with the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, have received the brief from Unigate. In part of the brief not referred to by the hon. Member for Workington, Unigate acknowledges that the role of the Office of Fair Trading will be critical. The role of the competition team at the European Commission will also be critical. The fear is that their reputations for acceleration are limited; they can be involved in an extremely slow process. The introduction, which has been acknowledged by both sides of the Committee, of a new system in a new market might mean that by the time those institutions take on board the special circumstances which we anticipate, businesses will be driven under by uncompetitive and unfair practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical issue concerns not the permanent arrangements to ensure that Milk Marque will operate on a fair basis, but how we reach that position—the early years and the transition. I hope that when the Minister responds to the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West, he will not be dismissive of the case for at least an interim organisation to ensure that disputes would be dealt with fairly. Whether that would take the format suggested by the hon. Member for Workington should not be decided by Opposition Members. But to suggest that there is no problem, that no interim organisation needs to be established and that no assurances need to be given, is unduly complacent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it clear that it would be better if we could retain something similar to the existing system of marketing and regulation under the MMBs. It is unsatisfactory to have to go for second best and find ways to make a different scheme work better, but it is our job to do that.

I made the fatal error of listening to the debate, and I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West said. If the system is to be seen to work fairly, there will have to be scope for the big, strong co-operative, which most of us hope will evolve in the vacuum created by the Government's proposals, to exist and for the small co-operatives and small businesses to be treated fairly. Otherwise, we shall enter a jungle which would be bad news for all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable that there will be disputes, especially against the backdrop of an undersupply—a shortage—of milk in the United Kingdom, which is a result of quotas. Processors and those who want to sell liquid milk will have to hustle for supplies at the right price. There will be an inevitable temptation—indeed, a dynamic—that will encourage suppliers to cut corners and take advantage where possible. It will be easy to find ways to discriminate between favoured and lesser-favoured customers, either in relation to volume supplies or the price of those supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his brief intervention at the beginning of our debate, the Minister tried to reassure us that there would be a sharp degree of surveillance by the competition authorities. It would be helpful if he, or somebody, could take us through what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is of the essence in such disputes. If a small or medium-sized dairy believes that it is being discriminated against by the main, strong supplier, action must quickly be taken to resolve that. Otherwise, those businesses will have to close production lines and dairies, stop producing cheese or yoghurt and will be unable to supply their liquid milk customers the following day: business will be wrecked. Time is of the essence, because any disruption to supply could be fatal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot have it both ways. He claims to be removing wicked state interference in the milk market in order to set the market free and allow 1,000 flowers to bloom and little businesses to operate in a free market atmosphere to everyone's advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That overlooks the underlying factor of the scarcity caused by quotas. We must face the fact that there will almost certainly be a big strong co-operative controlling the bulk of the milk supply. If such competition as the Minister wants is to be able to flourish and function efficiently, it must be considered fair. Justice delayed on a problem will be justice denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should tell us how the system will work. If a medium sized dairy in Gloucestershire reckons that it is being unfairly treated—that it is not receiving the supply to which it should be entitled or is being discriminated against on price—what does it do? Does it go to court or to the OFT? What happens? How long will that take? What will it cost? Even there, the dice will be loaded because the big operation—Milk Marque or whoever—will have all the lawyers, the cash and the resources and will be able to sweat it out. Perhaps after weeks, months or even years, the small operation might win its case but it will be far too late. The business will have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is serious about creating a fair and vigorous market that will operate in the consumers' interest, never mind that of anybody else, it is for him to explain how and whether such a market would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West has drawn the Committee's attention to a perfectly fair matter—there is a serious weakness and a real risk that, when it comes to the crunch and a dispute arises about supply or price, the delay factor will wreck the whole process. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that there should be provision for the prompt and fair settlement of disputes. I do not think that the Minister can shrug the issue off. It would be useful if he could return to this serious issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up my hon. Friend's point by quoting from a letter from Pinner Park farm, part of the Independent Milk Producers and Processors organisation, which describes itself as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a loose association of many small dairies and independently minded dairy farmers, whose common interest is to be free to buy or sell milk as they wish."</p></blockquote>
The organisation supports the Bill with one reservation, which is precisely the point being debated this morning. The letter uses harsh language, which I suspect is written by dairy farmers and producers rather than by the lawyers who might dominate the big players in the organisation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many past illegalities of the MMBs are being white-washed—laundered by Act of Parliament—so as to perpetuate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
in the free market some of the worst aspects of the old monopoly regimes."</p></blockquote>
I understand the small producers' opinion. Whether or not one agrees with their fairly harsh analysis is another point, but in the context of the changes that face us, I understand the call in the letter dated 12 April for a disputes procedure. In the final paragraph, the organisation asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"please that the Bill be amended to provide some effective forum to resolve disputes and, if necessary, to direct MMBs in their last days. We seek no discrimination, an open market and fair competition."</p></blockquote>
The Minister needs to take those points on board. In his earlier remarks, he argued for a genuinely free market. Small producers are worried about potential misuse of power by some of the larger organisations. The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West made an extremely valid point about the interests of small producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to sort out this problem. Under the current scheme, who complains most about what goes wrong? It is the small producers and processors, not the Unigates of this world, who write letters telling us that the whole set-up is terrible. Unigate and other large processors are settled into a beautifully cosy committee, by which they share out the milk amongst themselves. Theirs is a much more comforting and reassuring world than the world that we are about to introduce. It is frightfully nice and super. They are like the barons under King John when they asked the King to sign the Magna Carta.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current environment is not competitive. The people who lose out are precisely the small processors to whom the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) referred. They constantly write that they cannot get the supplies that they need to produce their cheeses. They say, "We've got a little cottage cheese industry. There's a market for it but we can't get the milk supplies."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. If he wants us to liberate the market so that his people have a better chance of obtaining supplies to enable them to compete in the marketplace and deliver what it wants, we cannot tie the scheme down by introducing surrogate rules that resemble those of the milk marketing board. I notice that an amendment has been tabled that seeks to recreate the apparatus of the joint committee. If we are not careful and we follow the tone of some of the amendments, we shall end up with something that is worse, not better, than the milk marketing board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me be clear about competition rules. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said that Brussels is slow to act. That is not always the case; sometimes it is able to move rather quickly. Sir Leon Brittan is no longer the competition Commissioner but his commitments have been inherited by his successor. It has been clearly stated that the new system will have two years in which to prove itself. The Commission will not intervene as long as certain conditions are met. Those conditions concern the floating of Dairy Crest so that it is not part of a virtually integrated co-operative. They also relate to the ability of producers to sign off from the new co-operative so that an excessive difficulty is not placed in the way of producers who wish to withdraw from Milk Marque and to move into an alternative organisation. Those rules will have to be clear. Those commitments are all examples of the hold-off policy of Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
Should the little company, to which the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred, feel that it was being unjustly treated and it went to Brussels and said to the Commissioner, "This is unfair. Will you investigate?", there is no agreement for Brussels to refrain from doing so. Its only commitment is that it will not initiate of its own volition an investigation as long as certain conditions are met. If there are protests by complainants, the Commission will be bound to investigate those complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, the hon. Member for East Lothian complained about the problems of the slow-moving OFT. However, he will be aware that recently, in the House, the Under-Secretary of State for Corporate Affairs made a statement on plans to strengthen the law to curb anti-competitive practices. One measure would be to speed up and strengthen the whole process. There would be the ability to make interim orders under the Competition Act 1980 to prohibit specified activities where there was good reason to believe that a customer, competitor or supplier risked suffering serious damage during an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Stronger investigative powers would be introduced to enable the Director General of Fair Trading to establish more quickly whether a full-scale investigation was necessary, and his ability to accept undertakings enforceable in a court of law, in lieu of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, would be extended. Companies are constantly complaining that their normal business is put on ice during an investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Judgment of the length of any delay is relative. Will the Minister tell us—perhaps not immediately, but as soon as he receives the appropriate advice—how long it would take to deal with a hypothetical dispute under the Bill's provisions and, thereafter, how long it would take under the new procedures suggested by the Under-Secretary of State for Corporate Affairs? I suspect that it will take months rather than days, which will be too late. By the time that justice is obtained, the business will have gone down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek to obtain the clarification for which the hon. Gentleman asked. As he will appreciate, I shall have to carry out some investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say this in a perjorative sense, but, by definition, a statutory scheme sets up a sort of cartelised arrangement. That cartelised arrangement no longer serves the national interest. We are entering a free market, in which the courts offer one remedy. Equally, nothing prevents parties to a dispute from settling by arbitration—it is not compulsory, but nothing prohibits it. As I say to my daughters when they bring a boyfriend home, "I have nothing against him, but neither do I especially like him"—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I had better not go into detail on that subject because I might get into hot water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing excludes agreement under an arbitration procedure; be it one borrowed from a predecessor—they may decide to borrow certain mechanisms that have been used in the past—or something ab initio. People seem to hold the opinion that we are moving from a regulated society towards some sort of Hobbesian society, in which everyone fights for his interests and there is blood all over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
the carpet—not milk because the hon. Gentleman will say that there is not enough milk. In a marketplace in which Milk Marque wants to sell its milk and people want to buy it and after a period in which the system will shake down and lines of supply will be established, when people will be anxious to ensure that the new system works, I wonder whether that view of society as being nasty and brutish will correspond to reality. The Amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has accepted that conditions in the new world may be such that some sort of arbitration procedure will be appropriate. He said that parties may reach agreement and set up an arbitration procedure. He accepts that an arbitration procedure may be set up and he has also expressed his concern that, under the old procedure a cartel was in operation, whereby certain people were in a dominant position to the exclusion of the small purchasing plant, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred. Given his concern about the power of individual purchasers and his recognition that some sort of arbitration procedure may exist in the new world, why cannot Ministers influence the development of that procedure? The Minister has condeded that it may be established and has recognised the potential for abuse, so why not influence its formation when he approves a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is normal practice that two parties in a dispute may agree to go to arbitration. We do not need to legislate for what is already perfectly acceptable, normal and conventional practice. If that is how parties want to settle a dispute, it is for them to do so. It is not for me to prescribe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the very point that I am making. If they agree upon it, they may create the structure that the Minister says concerns him—a structure that excludes the interest of the small processors to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred. Why not ensure now that that does not happen by allowing some influence over the sort of arbitration system that is set up subsequently to preclude the development which the hon. Gentleman conceded was unacceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction. I am not suggesting the creation of an institutionalised arbitration structure. I am talking about two parties to a dispute deciding to go to arbitration to settle that dispute. There is a world of difference between the two approaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue another point. I understand what the Minister is saying about institutionalising the system. That is a fair point. We are in danger of not only duplicating some of the inquiries and investigations, but triplicating them. That would not help anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of the Minister's intervention he made another point which gave cause for concern. He acknowledged my argument that the position during the transitional period or interregnum will be different from that after the shake down. Will the Minister go one step further and assure us that the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food will be available as a last resort? That
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
always applies to new legislation. The Minister cannot simply say, "That's it. Nothing to do with me any more. You are on your own from now on." That is especially so when there is such a clear distinction between the present regime and the new one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During his intervention the Minister acknowledged the force of my argument. I hope that he will give a few more words of assurance that he will not institutionalise a permanent arrangement, which could cause confusion and lead to lawyers milking the system, which we must avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman. The present scheme will exist until one second to midnight on a specified day and the new scheme will start at midnight. There will be no interregnum during which neither the MMB nor Milk Marque will exist. After the creation of Milk Marque, people will watch to see how the system shakes down and will establish their suppliers. After that, fairly regular supply lines will operate because continuity of supply is wanted. That is when the competition authorities will take over from the Department. Our intention is that that there will be heightened competition policy under national legislation and that Brussels will exercise vigorous supervision concerning the Community. Agriculture Ministers have the means to amend certain protections which are currently available under competition policy to ensure that it bears down even more directly on a successor body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been delighted with the response from Opposition Members. The hon.

I am convinced that any difficulties will arise during the transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a thorough debate and airing of views and there is little doubt that my hon. Friend the Minister understands the point.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee will recognise, some of the issues on these amendments were covered by our previous sitting when we discussed amendment No. 109 on consultation. Today, we are discussing the more substantial issue of the needs of the scheme. I was encouraged by the Minister's approach during our previous debate, but some untidy ends remain. Some tidying up may have occurred since then but I am far from clear that we have met the points which concern pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed last week the many people who have given great service to the industry and who have every right to expect that their pension arrangements will be fully protected under the new regime. As the Minister said this morning, we are moving from a managed system to a less managed one—a free for all in some respects—and it would be irresponsible if we allowed a free for all in the pension provision of those who have given such good service to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us will be meeting Maxwell pensioners this afternoon. I am sure that all the hon. Members, whether or not they have Maxwell pensioners in their constituency, are alert to the problems that have arisen in recent years. We all thought that pension arrangements could be relied on, that the supervision worked and that pensioner's interests were fully protected. As long ago as November 1992, Lord Howe stated in the other place that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The MMB has said that it wishes to maintain its scheme members' expectations. I understand that it intends to provide them with full details of those arrangements by way of future arrangements as soon as possible".—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 November 1992; Vol. 540, 
	<i>c.</i>860.]</p></blockquote>
Those details are still not available after some months. We are coming to the end of the parliamentary process and it is not unreasonable that the thousands of people who are concerned about the pension fund should be given the sort of reassurance that could be included in the Minister's statement of what he will be looking for when he approves the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state of the pension fund is not known to the pensioners. Any allocations of surpluses to successor bodies, staff and pensioners have yet to be considered. There is still considerable uncertainty. In today's pension environment, I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask the Minister to deal with the simple points that I put to the Committee last week. They should be endorsed by the Minister as necessary components of any scheme that is likely to be approved. First, the funding arrangements should be secure. Secondly, we should be clear about whether there will continue to be an annual review that is linked to inflation. That aspect should be specified in advance because past practice has not been laid down in black and white. Thirdly, benefits that are funded by the boards should be maintained on the current basis. Fourthly, pensioners should be accorded a role in the management of the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, it is not even clear whether we are to have one integrated fund for former and future employees of Dairy Crest, for the milk marketing board and for Milk Marque, or two separate, totally discreet funds. If it is the latter, other issues could be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous sitting, the Minister said that pensions were being given a high priority and that the situation was being carefully examined. That assurance provided
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
encouragement to those who are concerned about the issue. However, he went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are prepared to table an amendment in the Committee as soon as possible to clarify beyond doubt the position of pensioners."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 22 April 1993; 
	<i>c.</i> 103.]</p></blockquote>
I am bound to say that these amendments resolve nothing beyond doubt for me, but perhaps that is simply due to my ignorance. However, I know that pensioners, and representatives who have followed our proceedings, have not been reassured or comforted. Therefore, I hope that the Minister's response to amendment No. 110 will be as full and frank as possible, so that reassurance can be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a distinction between what he expected to appear on the face of the Bill and the reassurances that he expected from me about how we discussed the matter with the MMBs and the priorities that we impressed on them. That distinction is helpful. Clearly, pensions are not the boards' property and, therefore, the disposal of pensions cannot appear in the reorgansiation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, it is equally clear that the manner in which pensioners will be treated under the new regime is of material importance to them. Should the board fail to pay attention to that concern, it would be failing to be giving reassurance about an issue that is the subject of widespread concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point about the pension not being the property of the board. I welcome that statement, but will he extend it one step further and add that, in his view, any pension fund surpluses should not be regarded as the board's property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that matter when I have concluded my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wrote most recently to the board on 20 April asking it urgently to make a statement about the progress of its deliberations on pensions. We also asked for details about its proposals to consult pensioners. The legislative framework is still determined elsewhere and, as the hon. Gentleman will know, the Goode committee is considering the question of pensions legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the uncertainty about Dairy Crest, which is the reason for the amendment. The Bill states that the trustees can change the identity of an employer to the successor body, but it would not allow them to transfer all or part to Dairy Crest because it is not a successor body. The Government amendments would allow the trustees to change the identity of the employer. In practice, that would enable them to name Dairy Crest as the successor employer, which would give the trustees the power that the hon. Gentleman requested to clarify any uncertainty about the relationship between the Dairy Crest fund and the new scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked that I impress on the board the importance of explaining clearly to pensioners what will happen. I accept that undertaking. As I suggested, we have already begun to act on that because we have the same concerns as the hon. Gentleman. Amendments Nos.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up the point the was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston). The position in law is complex, as the Minister knows, and there are several important cases pending. However, the Government can influence the outcome of discussions with bodies with which they have a close association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An exchange took place in the House yesterday which related to the pension fund of the coal board. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The President of the Board of Trade has his sticky fingers on nothing whatever."</p></blockquote>
That caused laughter in the House. The hon. Lady continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no proposal which would mean that pensioners in pension funds transferring from the public to the private sector would not have their interests fully taken care of. That has been made clear by a number of Departments".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 April 1993; Vol. 223, 
	<i>c.</i> 718.]</p></blockquote>
In an earlier exchange in Committee, I referred to correspondence with the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, who is responsible for occupational pensions, and I shall bring that correspondence to his attention. The thrust of the correspondence concerned an argument which I think is morally rock solid and which can be influenced by the Minister. In the normal
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
day-to-day running of a pension fund, an argument can and has been advanced in law, although I do not accept it, that the employer has taken some of the risk by underwriting pension obligations when times are bad, and that therefore he is entitled to some of the surplus in good times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a change of ownership, however, the new employer will have taken none of the risk. There can be no moral argument for the new employer to get his "sticky fingers" on some of the surplus. The Minister is able to influence this pension fund significantly, and he needs to consider that carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. As he said, the discussion about the British Coal pension fund has made the area more confused than I thought it was. I have said that I shall come back to the Committee when I have had a chance to clarify the situation rather than pretend to do that now. I hope that the Committee will accept that assurance.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reassurances on the general point and for addressing the specific points on which he will come back to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will adopt the practice of the hon. Member for Workington who, at our previous sitting said that he had had great success in some of his briefing meetings by "privately squeezing" the people concerned. I should be grateful if the Minister would give the assurance that he will privately squeeze the MMB to be as forthcoming, forthright and speedy as possible with its proposals for a pension arrangement. Will the Minister try to get the board to come forward with those proposals before Report? That would not be unreasonable and pensioners would be reassured if a firm timetable were agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I withdraw the amendment, I should like to address briefly Government amendments Nos. 111 to 117. Although they are complicated, I understand fully what the Government have in mind. I am uncertain, however, about the strategic decision. It is not crystal clear—it has roughly the consistency of a milkshake—whether the Minister is determined to provide for, insist on or only accept a division of the fund. Will there definitely be two funds? If so, how could one, in the long term, guarantee that the beneficiaries of the two funds would be treated equally? That is always a difficulty with a change in an employer-employee relationship. It should be of concern that we do not know whether the Minister intends to insist upon a division of the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister respond to that point today? Otherwise, we may be doubtful about amendments Nos. 111 to 117 and we might not be as enthusiastic about the tidying-up operation on which he is set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether I would do some private squeezing of the MMBs. I thought that, within the bounds of public decency, I had been engaged in some fairly public squeezing, but I shall squeeze in whatever manner is deemed to be most acceptable. The information that is currently available to me suggests that one of the schemes includes MMB and Dairy Crest employees, but, because Dairy Crest has not become a successor body, that will have to be split.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales, because of the intention to float Dairy Crest, because there are cases against the board and because it will have to collect and pay for milk until the last minute, we need an authority to wind up the business and accept the board's liabilities.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 3, line 36, leave out "allow for" and insert "ensure".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important. It might provoke some debate and I appeal again to Conservative Members to speak to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tests the Government's commitment to real competition in the marketplace. The present wording of the clause is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the structure of the new arrangements contemplated by the scheme is such as to allow for the development of competition in milk marketing."</p></blockquote>
We want to delete "allow" and to insert "ensure". We want to place some responsibility on Ministers to be conscious of the need to ensure competition in the marketplace. We believe that the competition pressures necessary for a healthy market may not exist. We understand that every successor body, every purchaser and every seller of milk is subject to competition law
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
under the Fair Trading Act 1973, the Competition Act 1980, to some extent the Restrictive Trade Practices acts, and articles 85 and 86 of the traety of Rome. They are subject to regulation by the OFT, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission—which, to some extent, regulates what happens in the marketplace—and DG4 and DG6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MMBs tell us that, because the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food must approve schemes of the organisation, the OFT, the Ministry and the Commission must be satisfied that the arrangements do not breach competition requirements. We return to the old question: will a co-op with 80 per cent or 90 per cent, of the market clear the competition hurdle? The MMB responds that even were the new co-operative to have considerable success initially and were able to market a large share of milk, it would not have power that it could abuse or misuse. That is not the view of the processors. The board argues that the most powerful regulator of the new co-operative and its performance will be the fact that it will be a forced seller of a perishable commodity which it cannot store, the production of which it cannot influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier on in our proceedings I disputed the proposition that the United Kingdom market is freely open to imported milk and dairy produce, by pointing out that only UHT milk can be imported commercially the board argues that total dairy imports into the United Kingdom currently account for the equivalent of 30 per cent. of the United Kingdom's annual milk production, but that raises the question of how one defines milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, the processors are not convinced by the board's arguments. The words in the clause that I am contesting arise from a Government amendment to the Bill, following its consideration in Committee in the other place. In interpreting the words that I say do not go far enough, Lord Howe said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to be clear, too, what is meant by the words 'allow for' the development of competition. They do not mean that the boards will have to provide in their reorganisation schemes some kind of blueprint for the development of competition throughout the sector. Rather, they should be interpreted to mean 'allow room for' or 'allow scope for'. Ministers will be looking to judge whether a scheme would place important obstacles in the way of competition developing."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 25 January 1993, vol. 541 
	<i>c.</i> 1062.]</p></blockquote>
Do those words go far enough? Should not greater emphasis be placed on the need for prior judgment to be made to ensure that competition takes place in the market? When Ministers consider these matters we want the pendulum to move a little in favour of ensuring that competition takes place and that it becomes unnecessary to go to the OFT or other competition authorities to clear up matters that might arise through a failure of competition in the marketplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve and perhaps I can reassure him. It is not in the board's gift to ensure competition. The board must not act in such a way as to inhibit, stifle or preclude competition. However, the board cannot force other people to compete. It is important that the successor scheme should not be loaded in such a way as to create a disincentive for competitor bodies in their ability to attract producers. That returns us to the argument on assets, which has been a recurrent theme of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
It is also important that the membership terms of the board must permit for liberal leaving conditions. Otherwise, Milk Marque might be able to lock its producers into arrangements that prevent them from responding to better offers—to put it no more complicatedly than that. The scheme will have to include such conditions as one year's notice. A proposal that is being developed is that a notice be triggered three times a year, whereby people can leave Milk Marque on three months' notice on payment of a certain penalty. In other words, there will be fairly liberal leaving conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, the Director General of Fair Trading and the Secretary of State have wide powers on competition. It is true that there are some exemptions for agricultural co-operatives from restrictive trade practices legislation and the Competition Act 1980.I shall consider whether exemptions should be retained for an organisation that has £2.5 billion of sales per year. Agriculture Ministers have powers to make an order to limit or to remove the exemptions and I referred to that when we discussed a previous amendment. No final conclusions have been reached, but agriculture Ministers will be sensitive to the views that have been expressed about the clause in the Committee and in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally true that, reference to the MMC, the current restriction on liquid cows' milk other than in containers for retail sales will be lifted by statutory instrument when the milk marketing scheme ends. I hope that the hon. Member for Workington is reassured that we are serious about ensuring that the conditions for competition remain. I cannot accept his amendment, but I hope that he accepts what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying and I am sure that many members of the Committee will sympathise with the dilemma. It is a curious double negative. We are trying to ensure that the provisions are not anti-competitive, which is always tricky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am struck by one sentence in the brief supplied by the MMB, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the most powerful forces on Milk Marque and other suppliers of milk will be that they will be forced sellers of a highly perishable raw material which cannot be stored and over which they have no control of production."</p></blockquote>
Of course that is true and it will be an important discipline, but it is equally true that it could cut both ways because it could affect producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, we are principally concerned with the customers of Milk Marque, but we also have to be conscious that those who supply Milk Marque could be caught in an uncompetitive situation. I suspect that that might cause more concern and controversy because of the reasons that we touched on earlier. Several customers of Milk Marque will be big organisations; they already have much muscle in the market and will be able to afford to pay the legal fees to take a matter to the OFT or the Commission. They can withstand many of the pressures of a lengthy discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The competitive position vis-a-vis the suppliers of Milk Marque will be more difficult. By their very nature, suppliers are diffuse; there are many of them, and most are very small. It is in that context that this debate may need to be continued when we discuss some of the following clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
I hope that the Minister's optimism proves to be justified. We should be aware that we are by no means out of the woods in trying to ensure that the scheme will be effectively safeguarded so that there will be full competition without putting anyone at a major disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 3, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(g) whether the scheme makes a proper definition of those ancillary services which are to be carried out by a development council set up under the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947 and of those ancillary services which are to be carried out by successor bodies.'.</p></blockquote>
This probing amendment takes last week's debate on assets a step further. What is the Minister's attitude to the role that the development council will play in the marketplace? What are his views on the future of the National Dairy Council, which I understand is responsible for education and information about consumers, management issues, market research, nutrition and statistics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether there is a case for a development council is nothing to do with the Bill. Proper proceedings are laid down in the Agriculture Act 1947. It is a matter not only for the board, but for the whole industry. Equally, whether the council to which the hon. Member for Workington referred continues to exist is a matter for the industry. He asked me to spell out my attitude; I can tell him that I am sympathetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the industry would have to put proposals to the Government, who would have to be sure that there was substantial support for the council, which would be funded by a statutory levy. That is how development councils work. We would probably require a poll of producers, and we would certainly seek representations from processors. We would then need to make an order defining the council's functions and laying down the maximum levy—matters that are familiar to existing development councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One possibility—I mention it simply to put it on record—is that an organisation such as National Milk Records could go to a development council. The hon. Member for Workington will see that we have tabled amendments to permit that, should the industry decide that it wants a development council. I am sympathetic to the creation of a development council. Indeed, we believe that certain functions of industry are best undertaken by development councils. When we discuss the Bill's provisions on potatoes, I shall give exactly the same assurance. It is for the industry to make its proposals, but it will certainly receive a sympathetic hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall try to explain the amendment simply. I always find Government amendments more difficult to understand than those tabled by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to protect certain means of distributing assets to producers—for example, Dairy Crest shares—from the challenge of unreasonableness. At present, we protect distribution based on quantity of milk produced over a period or based on being in production at a certain time. The amendment would add the third category of being in production at some time during a particular period. We added that because the Northern Irish may wish to adopt that formula for its successor organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would permit three criteria: production over a period, being a registered producer at some time during the period, if not throughout that period—which is the new element—or being in production at a particular instant. Of course, the boards could propose other sorts of distribution, but without the protection of the clause. Challenge on those grounds would be productive and it would prevent the flotation of Dairy Crest in the time scale envisaged. The amendment is a facilitating amendment that will give the boards slightly wider powers in defining the categories eligible to receive assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand from the Minister's comments that there might be an overlap with the previous amendment, but I am sure that he will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a debate last week—I think—the hon. Member for North Cornwall queried who was entitled to what in the distribution of assets. The Minister referred to schedule 2(5) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the winding up of a board,"</p></blockquote>
and the liabilities of those producers who have been members of the scheme in the year preceding the winding up. On that basis, it is assumed that the assets of the board
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
will be distributed to producers who were members of the board for the preceeding 12 months: they would gain the assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 44 suggests that the period should be 18 months, in order to establish to what extent Ministers believe that there may be cases in the courts questioning whether producers have been fairly treated. In my earliest consultations with producers in the regions, it was suggested several times that actions might be brought by people who had been producers three, four, five years or 10 years ago and who believed that they too, should have access to the board's assets in the event that it be wound up in the future. My amendment does not take the issue back that far—only 18 months—but I want to test how far such matters have been taken into account and whether representations have been made by producers who think that they will be unjustly dealt with under the arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a practical problem with the amendment. At the moment, everything is geared to the quota year, so 12 months seemed a reasonable period, but because of the cycle of production, with its peaks and troughs, if were there to be an 18-month reference period some producers would have two troughs and others two peaks. That would be more likely to provoke the discontent that was referred to by the hon. Member for Workington, so I hope that he will accept that that is why we have settled for 12 months. I know that his amendment is only probing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(5), which deals with the period that triggers the distribution of the assets, would apply only to a period or date after the board had consulted producers about reorgansiation of the scheme. Consultation could not begin until Royal Assent was granted, so if the board wanted to base its asset distribution to producers on production in a quota year, it would have to opt for 1993–94. By definition, production cannot be established until well after the end of the year in question, which would be after April 1994. Because the England and Wales board hopes to float Dairy Crest before then and to issue Dairy Crest shares to producers, it seems sensible to allow it the option of basing distribution on 1992–93, on which full information will have been received. That would allow the earlier flotation of Dairy Crest. The clause provides the board with the option of doing that, in line with the practical timetables that it wants to pursue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked another question. Perhaps I mumbled the beginning of the amendment because I was trying to read the next amendment as I was moving it. What will happen to former producers who are no longer producing and who claim that they have been unreasonably treated? Are Ministers being lobbied by producers of five or 10 years ago who maintain that they have contributed to the assets and believe that there should be a share-out? I have not heard that argument much lately and I wondered if some asssurances had been given. The issue has been raised and I wondered what the response had been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply to the hon. Gentleman's question. We have received many representations from past producers, but, as the hon. Member for North Cornwall said during our previous sitting, producers who left the scheme realised their assets and, in so far as they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
contributed to them, they realised the benefit of their contributions. It is impracticable to determine entitlement to assets on the basis of 60 years of past history. How far back can one realistically go?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a challenge in the courts from past producers, and the purpose of clause 3(5) is to provide some protection for the bases of distribution that I have described. Ultimately, however, the courts may have to decide the claims of former producers, but we thought it reasonable to afford limited protection to the board if it decided to use certain methodologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that we do not know, but it is possibe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to clause 3(5). My amendment No. 11 came from the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation, which stated that clause 3(5)
	<br><blockquote><p>"requires the authority to be satisfied that the transfer of assets takes place later than the date when the Board had drawn 'the principles of the scheme' to the attention of registered producers. It should be amended to ensure that a reasonable time gap occurs between the notification of the proposals and the transfer of assets, in order to give producers a reasonable opportunity to consider the Board's proposal for distributing assets. This proposal will be crucial in determining whether or not producers choose to join or become members of any successor body. Unless they are given a reasonable opportunity for consultation, they may feel pressurised into joining the co-operative rather than deciding to stay outside."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister comment on the anxiety of the federation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend to table Government amendments to clause 3(5) to allow the period to which the hon. Gentleman referred to be between 31 March 1993 and vesting day inclusive. That would change the period to 12 months instead of at least 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with laying down specific periods is that although it is easy enough to verify what has been delivered to the board by various producers delivering, it could take some time to verify sales to direct sellers. The amendment is not justified and would not help assets to be distributed reasonably. We certainly do not want producers to have 30 days in which to boost production so that they receive a larger share of the assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we shall deal with the anxiety and that his amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is important and refers to one of the major problems in the Bill—parliamentary scrutiny of any approved scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with enabling legislation, which provides Ministers with considerable powers to take decisions. In the absence of consultation on the scale that we believe should have taken place, it could be argued that Parliament should have the right to consider these issues in some detail and to be given the opportunity—not the possibility of the opportunity—to take a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by clarifying not to members of the Committee—who, I am sure, are all aware of such matters—but to those outside the available options. Two procedures are open to us. The amendment would require that a decision be made under the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the negative procedure, as Members of Parliament, we are entitled to pray against whatever order or instrument the Government introduce, but the Government do not always provide time for debate. Orders under that procedure can be introduced and can take effect before a Committee debate has taken place. If they are voted against in Committee, they still stand. They can be rescinded only if the Government are prepared to allow time to discuss them on the Floor of the House and they are subsequently defeated. The problem with such a procedure is that time on the Floor of the House is given only at the Government's discretion. Unless the Government are prepared to allow time, Parliament will not take a decision on whatever Ministers decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the affirmative procedure, orders do not have to be prayed against. They are nearly always subject to Committee procedure and, under that procedure, they can be introduced and take effect before a debate in Standing Committee. If they are voted against, they automatically stand referred to the Floor of the House where they are debated again. If they are defeated at this stage, they are rescinded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under that procedure, Parliament has real influence and is required to debate what happens. The amendment would give Parliament the right to decide on a scheme in so far as it would ensure the parliamentary debate was allowed to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been told that some civil servants always resist Parliament having the right to debate such matters. I am sure that such resistence does not occur in MAFF but, on occasions, civil servants regard the meddling hands and mouths of Members of Parliament as unhelpful to the progress of legislation.

When the Bill was debated in the House of Lords, attempts were made to approve schemes by a parlimentary mechanism and to go further and secure a debate on the back of orders even on variations of schemes. We shall deal with that matter a little later in our consideration of the Bill when we come to consultation on variations of schemes. In the House of Lords, the Government argued that much in the schemes was sensitive and, therefore not for Parliament. Anyone who is interested would do well to read through the debate in the House of Lords. Lord Howe argued that Parliament should not have the automatic right to decide on such matters because of the sensitive nature of information that Ministers were being given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand that principle. It involves the historic scrap between Parliament and the Executive. It seems wrong that Ministers should be able to hide behind the sensitivity and confidentiality of information to get legislation through the House of Commons. I do not know whether that was what happened with the poll tax. If all the information that was directed to objecting to the poll tax that was given to the Ministers confidentially had been made freely available to Members of Parliament when we were debating that legislation, it might never have been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament should be given access to information and have the right to decide on whatever scheme the Minister finally decides to approve. We are talking about £2.5 billion of business annually—a sum larger than the turnover of several smaller western economies. Parliament should be given the opportunity to debate these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is seen by many outside Parliament as a stitch up. I am sorry to use such language at this stage in our proceedings, but many see it as a stitch up between the MMB and the Department. It is only by consulting at every stage and by ensuring wherever possible that parliament debates takes place that we can be sure that approved schemes will serve the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2, which I have tabled, has been referred to by the Dairy Trade Federation, which feels strongly about the matter. It has said that the new clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be inserted requiring the appropriate authority to make any finally approved scheme of reorganisation the content of a statutory instrument subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>is essentially an enabling Bill which, for England and Wales, will serve to bring to an end the Milk Marketing Scheme which has been in existence since 1933. Under the provisions of the Bill (in the case of England and Wales) the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food together with the Secretary of State has sole responsibility for deciding whether a scheme of re-organisation should be approved or not. The Minister's defence at Report Stage"—</p></blockquote>
in the House of Lords—
	<br><blockquote><p>"was that such an amendment would introduce considerable scope for confusion and delay. Given the radical change which is being proposed for the marketing of a product essential to the nation's diet, consideration by Parliament to ensure that any scheme of re-organisation meets the concerns and interests of all involved must be essential."</p></blockquote>
The Minister should look favourably on assuring Parliament that it had the opportunity to debate those matters prior to a final decision being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
The Minister may point us to clause 54(4) and (5). I hope that he is prepared to recognise that they do not allow for the parliament scrutiny that would be provided by the amendment. They deal with the levy and the consequential amendments which might be based on any modification to the scheme. Will the Minister clarify the position? It is odd that we have the right to some scrutiny of those consequential amendments but not the right to deal with the central proposition, which is the scheme as approved by Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the outset of our proceedings that the aspect of the Bill that gives me most cause for concern, and which worries all hon. Members, is the extent to which the Minister is giving himself powers in an enabling Bill without an apportunity for review on the Floor of the House. The amendment and the new clause go to the heart of that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, on several occasions in Committee, the Minister acknowledged that he cannot comment in advance on the nature of the scheme because it is hypothetical and he might prejudice consideration of the scheme, which, in a quasi-judicial fashion, he and his colleagues will have to consider later. That presupposes that there will be an opportunity for some parliament scrutiny of the detailed scheme. If the Minister cannot even tell us of the bones of the scheme, surely we are entitled to expect an opportunity at which a scheme of such importance, which will affect so many businesses, so many individuals, and, indeed, the food supply of the nation, can be given another parliament airing. On that basis, we want firm assurance from the Minister that he will recognise the concern in all parts of the House that an enabling Bill of such scope and scale should be given further scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that, so far, the Minister has not given much away. I do not criticise him for that; it is his responsibility and he has given us a straight bat whenever we have probed for further details of the scheme. However, he cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that it would be premature for him to give us details and that we shall have no other opportunity to discover what he will have in mind in approving a scheme. For those reasons, I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will press the amendment or the new clause—or both—to a vote to ensure that the whole House has an opportunity to consider the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a real chestnut of a Standing Committee debate—in which, I suspect, all of us have been involved many times before—about subjecting legislation to the affirmative procedure to ensure better parliamentary scrutiny. We have had many similar debates to leave out "may" and insert "shall", or vice versa. I confess that, on occasions, many of us have indulged in such debates with tongue in cheek. However, I seriously and genuinely believe that this debate is different and important. We should have credible scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 proposes the dismantling of the existing milk marketing arrangements and their replacement with something entirely different. Clause 3(3)(a) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the authority is satisfied that the scheme is one which ought to be approved, it shall grant the application".</p></blockquote>
Under clause 21,
	<br><blockquote><p>"references to the appropriate authority are—in the case of a milk marketing board whose area is in England and Wales, to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
That is what "it" in clause 3(3)(a) is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, it—the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—can, subject to many considerations, put the package into effect. That is important. As the hon. Member for North Cornwall said, that affects many well-established arrangements. It affects the market for milk, producers, processors, consumers and every one of us. People should be able to rely on Parliament to scrutinise such issues and should not have to leave them to the aforementioned "it" to determine. That is why we should legislate for an affirmative resolution instead of allowing the authority to go behind closed doors, decide whether a scheme is appropriate and sign the appropriate document. I do not know what they do with it then, but perhaps the Minister will tell us. I understand that it is lodged in the appropriate office—the Journal Office, I think—and the clock starts ticking. It may be some time before people become aware of it because it is not published. The clock is ticking on an order that is subject to the negative procedure for days or even weeks before people realise what is going on. All that we can then do is to table a prayer that the order be annulled. It is then up to arm twisting by the usual channels to establish whether there will be time in Committee or on the Floor of the House for that prayer to be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way and another, as happens frequently, time runs out or the issue is dealt with for an hour and a half on a take note basis in Committee and it does not matter how members of the Committee vote. Once an order has been tabled under the negative procedure by the authority—the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in England and Wales or the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland—it is all over. There is no more debate. Any details will have had to have been resolved behind closed doors before the order was drafted. There are esoteric bits and pieces of legislation and subordinate legislation for which it is probably perfectly fair to adopt such procedures, but the Government have done, so far as too often on issues that really matter and that affect people's lives, whether it is their legal rights or, as in this case, their economic well-being—their supply of food—that will be affected by changes being introduced on the diktat of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many occasions in the past 14 years when Parliament has not done its job properly. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred to the poll tax, which I will not go into as that would be out of order. For far too long, if She Who Must Be Obeyed said that something must be done, it was done. It is time that we started to apply a bit of scrutiny and genuine control over major changes to the affairs of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, the Bill is a significant change that affects many businesses and every person who consumes milk, so it should be subject to proper scrutiny. It would not kill the Minister to concede that point. It would mean only that instead of going through the negative procedure, which I tried to describe a moment ago, he would have to table an affirmative resolution, which would have to be debated on the Floor of the House or in Committee and approved, rather than doing it under the hole in the wall, negative system that we have been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be prepared to address this issue sensibly and sympathetically. If nothing else, I hope that the Committee will vote to stake the right for
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
Parliament to give active consideration rather than passive opposition to such provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee know that I deal with many scrutiny debates and statutory instruments, so I frequently find myself explaining the Ministry's policies. I know that the hon. Member for East Lothian is not suggesting that I am bashful when it comes to arguing my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington suggested that there was a stitch up between the MMB and the Department. If there has been a stitch up, there must have been an awful lot of trick fingers. I think that a bed of nails might be a more appropriate metaphor. We are unstitching a stitching. The whole point of the Bill is to unstitch complex legislation, not to stitch it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not be drawn into the cricketing metaphors used by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, except to say that I may have played a straight bat—people representing Yorkshire tend to do so and occasionally pad up outside the off stump. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede that, now and again, I have been content to play a ball into mid-wicket rather than try a flashy stroke over the slips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is this all about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not be expected to understand because he is a Scotsman, and the hon. Member for Bristol, East would not be expected to understand because she is a lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were we erecting a complex statutory scheme in which many rules were established, it would be entirely appropriate for Parliament to have the final say through affirmative resolution. We have affirmative resolutions in fisheries legislation, for which I am also responsible, because there is a detailed scheme of regulation that has to be applied. But we are unwinding a scheme of regulation. It is inappropriate to ask for parliamentary sanction for the non-existence, rather than the existence, of something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details—the nitty-gritty—will be complex. There will be enormous schedules of property. I do not think that Parliament would be happy dealing with such close detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the practical point that if Parliament rejected a scheme, where would we go from there? If Parliament cannot amend an order containing a scheme, do we go back to the drawing board? How long would the delays last? There may have to be a variation, which we shall debate in a following clause. Will we have to come back to the House of Commons for an agreement on a variation, and how long will those delays be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that I am not taking an ideological view hostile to affirmative resolutions because the legislation of which I am in charge proves that I am not. I merely say that I do not think that in this matter it would work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a frank admission from the Minister. The real reason why we shall not have the right that we seek is that if the Government lost, they

	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
would not know where to go. The Minister has said that they would not know what to do. Is that explanation acceptable to any member of the Committee—because Parliament might exercise a judgment that a scheme was unacceptable, the Minister is justified in not giving us the right to decide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was it not also interesting that the Minister used a comparison with the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill? If that were defeated in the House on an affirmative resolution, the Government have said that there is no alternative. They would have to go back to the drawing board. I am sure that the hon. Member for Workington would agree that it is the purpose of the House to say occasionally to Ministers, "Go back to the drawing board."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave us another reason. He said that Parliament would not be happy to deal with the detail. What a remarkable proposition. What are we doing in Committee? Are we not dealing with detail? Surely Parliament is constructed to deal with detail. If it finds the detail of a particular issue unacceptable, it can table motions and turn down Government proposals. What an explanation and justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Minister that we are happy to deal with the detail of schemes of reorganisation. We believe that we should have the right to decide on such matters. We believe also that we have the intelligence to understand the detail of the schemes. I think that that would be the view of Conservative Members of the Committee if only they could express it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a majority of people in the House of Commons who, in conditions of free voting, would argure that Parliament should have the right to decide on a matter that involves £2.5 billion of business being moved from the MMB to a deregulated framework for distribution. The Minister's answer is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am remined all the time of what happens in Northern Ireland. I do not know how the people of Northern Ireland put up with everything there being decided by a small body of people, often without reference to a Standing Committee of the House of Commons. Indeed, we shall be dealing with the reorganisation of milk marketing in Northern Ireland. How much scrutiny has there been of what is happening in Northern Ireland? Perhaps, we shall have the opportunity to debate those matters in more detail on Report, but there is little scrutiny of the proposed schemes for reorganisation in Nothern Ireland. Yet we know that concern exists because represenations of the MMB have been to the United Kingdom to lobby Members of Parliament. Those matters do not receive the same level of scrutiny in Committee because we are not as appraised of conditions in Northern Ireland as are Northern Ireland Members, and none of them is a member of the Committee. They complain about consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland Members will have the right to speak on these matters only on Report, and only at the discretion of Madam Speaker. Indeed, it could be said that, unless they have the opportunity to discuss them in the light of the proposals that we have put to the Committee today, they will never have an opportunity to express a view
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
about what will happen to one of the largest businessess in Northern Ireland—milk distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that Members of Parliament should have the right to decide such matters on the Floor of the House. The Minister has come to Commmittee running scared of Parliament. By saying, "If we lose, where will we go from here?", the Minister is running scared of the House of Commons. He should be able to command a majority if the scheme that he wants to approve is sensible. I am sure that many Opposition Members will vote in favour of a sensible scheme of reorganistion. We may not oppose it, so what is the Minister worried about? Perhaps he realises that the scheme that he may have to approve will not gain the support of the majority of the House of Commons because Members may resent, and not wish to support, certain components of that scheme, but that cannot be a justification for denying Parliament the right to decide. I ask the Minister to think again about that issue. The amendment and the new clause are important and we feel strongly about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 4, line 20 after "above", insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 13 relates to schemes that are unacceptable to Ministers in the form in which they are submitted, but which are capable of being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
modified to bring them within clause 3(3)(a). The amendment provides that modifications proposed by Ministers, and the reasons for them must be drawn to the attention of the parties that are likely to be affected. In effect, this is another consultation amendment. One would have thought that Ministers would want to discuss these modifications with consumers, retailers, producers and processors. In my view, in replying to the debate, if they plan to reject the amendment, Ministers should justify their decision not to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 is another consultation amendment. It would ensure that, after the board had been notified of any modification, interested parties would be informed about any consultation that had taken place, and to what extent their concerns had been taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 36 relates to the board's actions and would place a responsibility on it to consult interested parties on any modifications that the Government propose to make to any scheme. It is an important amendment because, as I have said repeatedly during our proceedings over recent weeks, the industry feels that it is not being consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the famous contract that the MMB sent out and upset the industry with some weeks ago had been subject to an element of consultation, I am sure that the MMB would never have sent it out and that the argument that raged in the industry over subsequent weeks would have been avoided. It is easy to take a little decision without understanding its implications and to what extent it would cause concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to take on board exactly what clause 4 provides. It sets out the most detailed arrangements that must be followed by the authority—which is, of course, the Government—and the various steps that have to be fulfilled if a scheme is not to be approved. If the hon. Member for Workington thinks that the authority will not consult interested parties before reaching a conclusion, I wonder what he thinks it will do. Clause 4(2) indicates the first steps that should be taken. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) set out what must be done before the authority refuses the application. Subsection (3) provides how the scheme might be modified. Subsection (4) provides for what happens if modifications are agreed to. Subsection (5)(a) concerns what happens if the authority has not been persuaded that no modifications are required. Subsections (6) and (7) provide for alternative suggestions and further consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the clause comprises a series of consultations in order to produce an approved scheme. I am sure that that is what all members of the Committee want. It is equally important to have such a scheme in place by April next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways, the amendments double up on what has already been provided. Eventually, we could be swamped by consultations and make no progress. Inevitably one must allow a formal period for formal consultation, whether it be four, six, eight or 10 weeks. The deadline might arrive before a conclusion has been reached. The authority, which is represented by the Government, would not want to rush through consultation to implement a scheme at all costs by 1 April. It is more
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
important that the scheme is right and acceptable to all than to proceed at too great a pace. The authority could not possibly approve a scheme without detailed consultation with all those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment of the hon. Member for Workington, every individual producer would have to be consulted. That would be going too far when most producers belong to organised groups such as the National Farmers Union. There is no possibility of proceeding without the most detailed consultation, and we would not wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 could be taken to imply a requirement to consult every producer or consumer individually even outside a board area. That would be extremely burdensome on any proposed time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 would require Ministers when proposing modification of a reorganisation scheme to a board to inform it of what consultation had taken place with producers on those modifications. Such consultations will take place anyway, as I have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 36 would over-egg the pudding so much that we would not make the progress that will be essential. If there is any need for the authority and the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What did the Minister mean when he said that we would not make the progress that is essential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is straightforward. Our objective is to have a scheme in place by April 1994, and that is a reasonable objective. I said that haste must not overtake prudence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I said before, and I thought that I had made that clear. I also made it clear that Ministers will consult the authority on any issue if it considers that necessary to reach a conclusion. I cannot imagine a clause being written in greater detail than by giving the steps which the authority must take when faced with many options. It is the fullest consultation that could be expected in achieving the correct decision by April 1994.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister is saying. On one hand, he is saying that the amendment is superfluous and that it is doubling up. On the other, he is saying that the amendment is unnecessary. He cannot have it both ways. There may be a problem with amendment No. 13, but he is implying that under amendments Nos. 37 and 36 the authority could not determine what consultation would be appropriate. Surely it will be clear whether appropriate consultation has taken place, or whether the process has been excessive. I cannot see how the problem of undue delay will occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government are determined to get the scheme right rather than simply get it on time. That priority is correct. It would be absurd if 1 April 1994 figured so fundamentally in the Ministry's thinking that it accepted a half-baked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
scheme, but to resist the amendments on grounds of duplication and contradiction—that they are superfluous and unnecessary—is peculiar. Will the Minister tell us which he means? If the Government believe that the Bill will satisfy every aim of the amendments, they are superfluous. If they believe that the amendments go too far and that consultation would be excessive, we are entitled to ask at what point they will draw the line and say that sufficient consultation has taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is spoiling his image as the nice guy on the Government Bench. We expect such hard-line replies from the Minister of State. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great believer in trying to take advantage of debates in Committee to obtain information from the Government. I accept the Minister's point that there is an entire page of small print relating to the principle of consultation. He suggested that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington is superfluous but, contradictorily, he said that it would be obstructive. That needs to be explained. To get around the conundrum, the Minister could take the opportunity to explain exactly what will happen and how the system will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority, described later in the Bill as "it", is the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) himself, in all his divine splendour. "It" is a sort of Trinity—no, not a trinity, but one. The right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang), who is the Secretary of State for Scotland, will be the almighty "It" in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not kid ourselves. Neither the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal nor the right hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale will sit in a large room in their respective Departments, pore over the details and minutia of the schemes and talk to all those who are interested. That will be handled at another level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful if the Minister could explain step by step how the respective authorities intend to assess the schemes, adjudicate on them and reach conclusions. Will that all be done centrally for England and Wales? Will one official at the MAFF go through all the information, examine the submission put in by Milk Marque, reach a conclusion, and draft an order to be rubber-stamped by the authority, which will be lodged in the House of Commons to be effective in due course? Or will there be genuine scope for consultation? At what level will that be? Will mere be scope for individual businesses, producers or co-operatives at regional level to have a genuine input into the procedure at an early stage? The MAFF roadshow is currently travelling round England and Wales telling farmers how to fill in their forms. Can the Minister tell me whether the same thing is happening in Scotland? I have not noticed, but if it is not, perhaps it should be. Will mere be a parallel opportunity for people involved in the milk industry, be they producers, processors or consumers, to have an imput?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the roadshow is unprecedented in history. On every spare day that Ministers in the Department can find, they travel throughout the country trying to sell a scheme that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
know they let through at a Council of Ministers meeting last year, perhaps by accident—I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had there been consultation on that issue, Ministers might not be in the position that they are today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I might stray out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Workington said was drivel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is a helpful admission. I wish that the Ordnance survey had been informed, but that is another story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seriously, will the Minister take the opportunity to give us a brief account of how the authority—in Scotland, as far as he is concerned—will approach the task? Will there be a genuine opportunity at regional or local level for people involved in the industry to come face to face with senior officials and have an input into the construction of the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we have not been running a roadshow in Scotland. Matters are running smoothly and I think that by 15 May all the forms will be in the various regional offices and the farmers will be able to look forward to substantial payments in return for their hard work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about my form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall get it. Having such a large estate and so many different arable fields, the form will take a long time to complete. However, I must not stray away from the issue that is before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Member for East Lothian, with his wealth of experience in Parliament, does not begin to understand how Governments reach conclusions on major issues such as this. He knows perfectly well that detailed consultation takes place between the Department and Ministers and across the board between the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland Office, as well as between MAFF and the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple answer to the hon. Member for North Cornwall, who always wants simple answers, is that amendments Nos. 37 and 36 are unnecessary and that amendment No. 13 is superfluous and repressive because it would include far too many consultees—every person who is interested in milk production and consumption. That would be impossible if a finite decision is to be reached by 1 April 1994, as is preferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in no rush to reach a decision. That is why we want the schemes to be put forward in the early autumn so that there is plenty of time to put them in place by next April and plenty of time for consultation. If the hon. Member for Workington, who is itching to speak again, reads clause 4, there is an entire page of detailed steps, all of which require consultation, before decisions are made. I do not think that there is any conceivable scheme that any Government would suggest that is not so reliant on detailed consultation with those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee understand that we are trying to deal with the issue and with all parts of the industry constructively to get the best result in terms
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
of what Europe and competition policies tell us we must do. At the end of the day, those involved will believe that the Bill has been dealt with prudently and that all the required consultation is necessary. Therefore, I oppose the amendments—two are unnecessary and the third would put an intolerable burden on those carrying out the consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the words "those involved" and "those concerned", and that is exactly what is wrong. "Those involved" and "those concerned", as the Minister understands them, are not necessarily the organisations that we think should be involved in the wider consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the whole of clause 4 made reference to the consultation arrangements which are dealt with in our amendments. Perhaps he can tell me to which organisations in clause 4 he is referring. They are not those that I am dealing with in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that amendment No. 13 would require us to consult every producer and consumer organisation. Where does it say that? I do not interpret the amendment as placing a requirement on the MAFF to consult every producer and consumer. The amendment reads,
	<br><blockquote><p>"following consultation with parties likely to be affected directly or indirectly by the proposed modifications".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
That does not place a responsibility on Ministers to consult every person involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What on earth does it mean, then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should take the advice of a lawyer. It means that there should be consultations with parties likely to be affected. Ministers will decide who is likely to be affected. They will claim that in meeting a particular organisation they are meeting the representatives of those people in a particular group who are likely to be affected. The amendment does not lay a specific responsibility on the Minister to meet every organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been drafted in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, perhaps I have drafted it that way as far as the Minister understands it. The amendments were pored over by people in the Dairy Trade Federation, although I am not saying that they would claim responsibility for them. I am sure that they would have told me were the amendments unnecessarily restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
