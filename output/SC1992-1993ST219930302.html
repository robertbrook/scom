	<div class='legislation'>Draft Council Tax Benefit (General)
<br><br><!-- lb --> Amendment Regulations</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Burt)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Council Tax Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1993.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, we shall debate also the draft Council Tax Benefit (Permitted Total) Order 1993.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations which I commend to the Committee, introduce amendments to existing council tax benefit regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that the House carefully and comprehensively debated the main council tax benefit regulations last year. The amending regulations will change the earlier regulations in a small, but mainly beneficial way. A copy of the regulations has been put before the Social Security Advisory Committee and the local authority associations have been formally consulted. I am, as ever, grateful for their comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amending regulations are necessary for three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, they will ensure that the council tax benefit regulations are aligned with other income-related benefits. The Government's objective is for common rules to apply across benefits wherever practicable. Many of the amendments are therefore being introduced to reflect changes made to other income-related benefits last year, or those due to come into effect in those benefits from April. Secondly, they will correct minor, often typographical, mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, they are a response to concerns expressed by some local authorities and other interested bodies that a small number of provisions require clarification. Our policy on council tax benefit has never been in doubt; the amendments merely ensure the fulfilment of that policy. Many of the changes are technical so I shall not give the committee a full account of them. As an example, however, we have connected a wrong cross-reference in regulation 10 by changing the letter (a) to (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain in greater detail other changes which I am sure that the Committee will find of interest. We are amending regulations to ensure that payments to foster parents, which are already ignored as an income in council tax benefit, canot be treated as self-employed earnings. That beneficial change ensures that people gain the full benefit of fostering fees. Without the amendment, people undertaking fostering duties might be regarded by local authorities as engaged in self-employment and suffer a reduction in benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The regulations increase the amount that can be disregarded from a student's income towards the cost of books from £257 to £267 a year, in line with other income-related benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will welcome the introduction of a new earnings disregard for carers. From April 1993, all carers who are entitled to the carer premium in any income-related benefits, including council tax benefit, will be entitled to the £15 disregard on their earnings. A similar amendment will be made to all income-related benefits and will help more than 2,000 people who combine work with providing carer. It will give further encouragement to carers who would like to undertake extra work alongside their caring commitment, but who feel unable to do so. The improvement is additional to the carer premium that will be worth £11.95 a week from April, and is payable to carers whether or not they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide for the removal of the outgoing maintenance disregard of any maintenance payment made by people receiving council tax benefit. At present, a rule operates, in only community charge benefit and housing benefit, whereby the amount of income taken into account for benefit purposes can be reduced by the amount of maintenance paid. That will normally result in the award of higher benefits than would otherwise have been paid. That means that effectively the tax payer is helping to subsidise maintenance payments regardless of the recipient's income. The introduction of the Child Support Agency in April will remove that anomaly. The Agency will gradually assume responsibility for assessing child maintenance according to a standard formula. That will ensure adequate maintenance for the support of children while protecting the needs of the absent parent and any family. Until the Agency takes over, people will be advised by local authorities that they may seek to vary their maintenance payments from April either by application to the courts or by voluntary agreement in the usual way. That step will enable people to make the necessary arrangements, if they wish, before the change takes effect. The amendment will ensure consistent treatment of outgoing maintenance payments in council tax benefit, housing benefit and other income-related benefits, from April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with changes already made to the housing benefit regulations last October, we are amending the way in which the income of a non-dependant and second adult are calculated for council tax benefit purposes. That change ensures a full disregard of payments from the Macfarlane Trusts and the special fund set up to help haemophiliacs and other people who have tragically contracted the HIV virus through NHS infected blood products. Hon. Members will know that those payments are already fully disregarded in respect of benefit recipients and members of their families. The proposal will ensure that non-dependants and second adults are treated similarly. Because of the special nature of the payments, hon. Members will be pleased to hear that we are also protecting the confidentiality of beneficiaries by providing that payments do not have to be declared to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another change, which I am sure will be welcomed, is a full disregard of guardian's allowance of £10.95 a week from April. This will help about 2,000 people across the income-related benefits with the costs of bringing up an orphan. Therefore, people on income-related benefits will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
gain the same help from guardian's allowance as those people who have higher incomes and do not have to claim benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said before, several changes are being made to guarantee that our policy intention is achieved. For example, the regulations provide that people receiving the higher pensioner premium under community charge benefit will continue to do so on the transition to council tax benefit. We are also ensuring that belated awards of mobility allowance paid as a lump-sum will not affect benefit entitlement for a period of 52 weeks from when they are awarded. I am sure that all of those improvements will be very welcome for people on benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the Council Tax Benefit (Permitted Total) Order. The main Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations provide local authorities with a discretionary power to make additional payments of council tax benefit when they consider the circumstances of the claimant to be exceptional. Under the provision, local authorities can increase the amount of benefit paid in particular cases, but not so as to exceed 100 per cent. of the maximum council tax benefit, or 25 per cent. of second adult rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is required, by primary legislation, to set a ceiling, or a permitted total, on the amount of discretionary payments that an authority may make. The Council Tax Benefit (Permitted Total) Order fulfils this requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order sets the ceiling for discretionary payments at 0.1 per cent. of the total amount of council tax benefit that the authority pays out in the course of the year. I should point out that that ceiling is in line with the limit that applies currently in housing benefit and community charge benefit and has been agreed with local authority associations, following consultation. It is a welcome addition to local authorities' spending powers, which, for individual authorities, can amount to several thousand pounds. They could be used, for example, to help a person who has spent extra money on having to visit a sick relative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained earlier, the regulations and the order make minor changes, most of which are entirely beneficial. They will assist thousands of people who will be liable to pay council tax. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement on the council tax; it makes a nice change to debate regulations with him before, rather than after, they have been implemented. I hope that that is a practice that the Government will maintain, particularly when the Opposition are praying against regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that the amendments are technical and 10.30 on a Tuesday morning is not always the best time to be as clear as possible on some of the technicalities that I wish to bring to the Minister's attention. I know that, in the Minister's normal spirit of co-operation, he will be willing to write to me in detail on some of the points that I shall raise. As the Minister said in his opening remarks, advisors and practitioners in local government and elsewhere must be certain how to interpret the regulations. It is essential that answers to my points that the Minister does not have this morning are put in writing so that we can advise local authorities on their anxieties about the regulations. Part of the anxiety arises because, although the Government have abolished it, the poll tax still lives in some form. Many problems in interpreting the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
regulations will arise because the Government retain an element of the poll tax in the new council tax. Therefore, it may still be difficult to assess individuals under the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that thousands of students in my constituency will dance in the street because the disregard on books will increase by the substantial amount that the Minister announced. However, I am not sure that it is a major concession when many students wish that they had enough money to buy their books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to consider matters that have been fully aired in the House and in another place. However, it is worth commenting on the Government's decision not to relent on the 20 per cent. taper. From my reading of amendments that were tabled in another place, the Government refused to make concessions on that point for purely financial reasons. The clear disincentive of the 20 per cent. taper when it interreacts with other benefits, and its consequences for the poverty trap, were not fully examined. The Government should view benefits consistently to ensure that no disincentives exist when drawing up regulations, because there are implications for more than one benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax is dead, but it will not he down. The second adult rebate, which is set out in the regulations, is at best, unclear. Its practical implementation will be complicated. Local authorities have many anxieties about interpreting and implementing the second adult rebate, especially the calculation that they must make between the liable person and the second adult in the home. As with other benefits, a "better-off" problem exists. I hope that the Minister will answer the points that I shall make, and assure us about the technicalities—in writing if he cannot do that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "better-off" problem is complex. Advisers must determine the best rout: the main route through the council tax or a second route through the second person rebate. That complicates the administration. Many advisers will find it difficult to make such an assessment correctly. If the Government have learnt from the poll tax, they should make regulations as simple as possible to administer in our town halls and thus avoid the chaos that ensued from the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other place, it was stated that the second adult rebate applied to few people and therefore we should not exercise our minds too much about the problem. However, it may apply to thousands of people. The Government should ensure that the regulations are correct and clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point about the second adult rebate scheme is the probem that it creates in the household. The liable person will have to be clear about the circumstances of the second and other adults in the household, especially about their incomes, so as to calculate who is best placed to claim the rebate. We need to ensure confidentiality because these are incomes of non-dependants, and information on the relationship with the liable person should be freely given and should enable a proper claim to be made to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules must also ensure that the people in the household know whether they are entitled to claim the rebate. For ease of administration, some local authorities have put only one name on the bill of any particular household. People may feel that because that person has received the bill, there is no route for claiming benefit other than by the named person. Equally, because the other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
people in the household under the second adult rule are not named on the bill, they may not be aware that they could be entitled to claim rebate themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations allow late claims to be made when there has been uncertainty on those two points, but many people who have misinterpreted their rights under that part of the regulations and who may be entitled to claim rebate and maximise the benefit in the household may not have done so within the limit of 56 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An added problem, which was also found with the poll tax, is that people's incomes and circumstances change quite frequently. The better-off calculation—whether the liable person or the second or subsequent adult should claim council tax benefit—may change over time and that will again lead to administrative complexity for the local authorities and to difficulties in ensuring that the better-off rule applies and that people in the household are maximising their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to tell us how, in practice, guidance will be given on the administrative problems of the second adult rule to ensure that changes in circumstances are taken into account. The rebate in the family should be maximised, so clear guidelines about who is entitled to claim the benefit should be issued to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tied closely to the second adult rule is the definition of "non-dependants". Local authorities are worried because the regulations do not clearly define non-dependants. I hope that the Minister will explain that, because although for other benefits "non-dependant" is specifically described, it is not so clear in these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There also seems to be—I stress the word "seems" because I am not a lawyer and I have tried to get my head round these regulations—some disparity between schedule 9 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 and section 133 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 on the matter of disregarding rent from a lodger or a student in the household. These regulations may consolidate the provisions of those two Acts, but there is some anxiety that they have not been consolidated properly and that appeals may result. I am trying to help out the Government and to ensure that such appeals are not necessary by making the sets of regulations contained in those Acts absolutely clear for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another source of major anxiety in the regulations is the capital rule. I have examined that rule very carefully and can say only that at best it is confusing and at worst gobbledegook in what it says about the interpretation of the income of the liable person and of the second adult. The rule is a tortuous exercise in setting out when the notional capital income is and is not disregarded. Nor is it clear how the capital cut-off of £16,000 on the second adult is interpreted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's officials look rather puzzled that I should have raised that matter. My purpose is to get the Minister to clarify the way in which the capital rule will be interpreted for the second adult rebate under new regulation 45 in amendment 26(b). The regulations contain anomalies over the way in which the capital disregard will be implemented. Perhaps the Minister will be able to assure the Committee that the provisions are crystal clear and to advise me about their operation in practice, but there is some confusion about the circumstances in which the notional capital income is implemented on the second adult
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
and about the way in which that interacts with the liable person. Clearly, from that confusion flow problems about the calculation of whether it is better to claim through the main council tax benefit or through the second adult rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another concern about which I seek clarification is the definition of the term "non-dependant" in relation to people with disability. The Minister knows that we have been battling for some time over the severe disability premium, about which, unfortunately, the Government got their way when the matter went to the House of Lords for a ruling. The anomaly is that the definition of what constitutes non-dependancy penalises the people who ought to be able to claim the severe disability premium. I have asked the Minister already for clarification of the term "non-dependant", but the regulations contain other definitions that are not clear. Specifically, I am worried about the way in which the regulations deal with the interrelationship within a household of people with disabilities. When one adult in a household is severely physically handicapped and the other is severely mentally handicapped, the regulations are not clear about the way in which the interpretation of "non-dependant", as applied to severe disability premium, impinges on the calculation of the maximum rebate. One possibility is that the definition in the section could be extended to make it clear that it excludes people with severe disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the Minister's advisers appear somewhat puzzled—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer to civil servants, or Officers of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Hogg. The Minister is looking puzzled on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are technical matters many of which have been raised with the Minister and others. Definitions and possible anomalies are causing problems. We may be talking of only very few people but unless the regulations are clear, someone who is already disadvantaged by not being able to claim severe disability premium, as in my example, may be doubly disadvantaged because he will not receive maximum rebate through the second adult rebate scheme. Therefore, I seek clarification, or an assurance that such people will not be disadvantaged in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the regulations are so technical, I want the Minister's reassurance that when anomalies arise, as they will after 1 April, we can have an open dialogue and communication, that the anomalies that the local authorities will highlight as they try to get to grips with interpreting and implementing the regulations will be tackled and ironed out, and that blame will not attach to local authorities on the basis that they cannot administer the benefits correctly because they are in chaos again—as happened with the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about maintenance disregard, stating that it should not be regarded as taxpayers subsidising maintenance. We have discussed the role of the Child Support Agency. However, abolishing the possibility for a disregard on maintenance may in the short term lead to people avoiding maintenance payment, so as to maximise rebate, and putting extra burdens on the Child Support Agency at a time when its burdens will be immense anyway, as it becomes operative. We should be clear about the consequences of the disregard. The Minister said that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
is being brought into line with treatment of other benefits. Perhaps in some respects it is unhelpful to introduce it at the same time as the Child Support Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those brief comments, I shall allow the Minister to respond, so that my hon. Friends can tease him further on the detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall raise four points. The first relates to the taper, and was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley). We are disappointed that the Government have not amended the taper of council tax benefit. Will the Minister confirm that the effect of a 20 per cent. taper, with a 65 per cent. taper on housing benefit, applying to households in low-paid work and subject to 25 per cent. income tax and 9 per cent. national insurance contributions, will be that such people will lose 90 per cent. of each extra pound they earn unless they receive family credit—in which case they will lose 97p in the pound? Does the Minister consider it acceptable that people in low-paid work should be subjected to such draconian and steep withdrawal rates of benefit? Is not it time the Government reconsidered all this and introduced amending regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is highly technical. There are at least two references to "rent" as opposed to "eligible rent". Why the change? Will the Minister explain why regulation 8, which amends regulation 26 of the principal regulations, and regulation 25, which amends schedule 4, include that change of terminology and what the implications are?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question is complicated, but of genuine concern to my constituents. A group of them live in a council housing block which was built on the edge of a traditional square, with a garden in the centre. That garden is subject to the Town Gardens Protection Act 1863, which allows a garden committee to levy a charge for the upkeep of the garden from all people living in premises surrounding the garden. My constituents in the council block of Maribor have no access to the garden. Indeed, when the block was built, the entry was on the other side facing away from the garden as a result of hostile pressure from the better heeled residents of the area surrounding the garden against the building of a block of council flats in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, because the windows of Maribor face on to the garden in Gloucester circus, my constituents have been receiving an annual bill, which, last year, was £25 a head. They are obliged to pay that bill; the local authority has no discretion and has to levy the charge. Many of the tenants of the block are deeply aggrieved: they have no benefit from the garden, they are required to pay £25 a year for it and they get no rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister advise us on whether it is reasonable and proper for such charges not to be eligible for rebate? Is not it appropriate to bring such charges within the remit of council tax benefit? There is a clear case in equity to follow that procedure. There is a reason why that should be tackled urgently. Because of the incompetence of the valuers who are valuing blocks for the council tax, the block whose rear windows face on to Gloucester circus has been put into a higher band than the other block in the council estate, which faces the other way but is otherwise identical. My constituents will have to pay not only the garden charge, which is levied on them, but a higher rate of council tax. They are rightly aggrieved about that. I hope that the Minister will agree to study that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Finally, I shall deal with the Council Tax Benefit (Permitted Total) Order. Is the Minister satisfied that the 0.1 per cent. figure is reasonable? It is only a tiny and derisory sum in many areas and gives little scope for the exercise of discretion, about which the Minister talked. When the original rent rebate and allowance scheme and the rate rebate scheme were introduced, the discretion was rather greater. Is not it time to reconsider that? Will the Minister tell us about the exercise of that discretion? How many authorities are not exercising that discretion at all? How many have not made any discretionary payments in the past two years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More pertinently, when some authorities are already considering contracting out the administration of benefits, including council tax benefits, who will exercise that discretion? Will it be the contractor and, if so, what is the provision for a non-statutory body exercising such discretion? What is the route of appeal, when the contractor declines to exercise that discretion? Is the appeal first to the local authority or to the review board? Those are important administrative issues, on which I hope that the Minister will give us an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.3 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For 10.30 in the morning, I think that the Committee has made more than a good stab at dealing with the technical background to the amendments. I pay tribute to my colleagues whose knowledge of the issues are such that they have kept silent, knowing the answers to some of the Opposition's questions, yet having some confidence that I shall deal with the matters on their behalf. I pay tribute to their silent wisdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington did his usual job of opening up matters in a most constructive way. As always, I am grateful to him for that. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), in his usual way, made my blood run cold as he stood up. His knowledge of these matters is formidable. I am pleased with myself because I was able to follow the vast majority of what he said. I have answers for most of his comments off the top of my head; I am sure that the other answers can be supplied by colleagues who may or may not be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a wide-ranging debate on a good set of regulations and on an order that will affect about 5 million people as well as the 401 local authorities in England and Wales and the 12 regional councils in Scotland that will administer the scheme. That is the nature and scope of these changes, so it is right for hon. Members to want clarification for those who will have to administer the scheme, and we want to provide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to view the taper not in isolation but in the context of the other considerable changes to the benefit system that the Government have announced. First, 100 per cent. maximum rebates will be available and will benefit all claimants, including those with incomes above income support level. That change was welcomed by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Furthermore, all claimants will gain from the Government's decision not to claw back any of the amounts included in income support levels, as with the 20 per cent. contribution under the previous community charge. That will be worth a total of £750 million at 1992–93 levels despite the fact that there will be no minimum contribution under the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I believe that overall benefit entitlement under the new tax will extend to claimants with broadly the same levels of income as those helped by community charge benefits. Although tapers are steep, they should not be seen in isolation and it should not be ignored that significant extra assistance will be given to a number of people as a result of the decision not to claw back the amount of money currently paid in community charge contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to seek clarification of second adult rebates, but I believe that the information that we have provided is as clear as it can be. Second adult rebate is unique to the council tax benefit. If another adult—or adults—is living on a non-commercial basis with a person who is liable to pay the tax, the liable person will get adult rebate of 25 per cent. if the second adult is on income support, 15 per cent. if the second adult's gross income is £105 per week or less, and 7.5 per cent. if the second adult's gross income is £105 to £134.99. No rebate will be payable if the second adult's income is £135 per week or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no difficulty with capital because there is no capital rule in relation to the second adult rebate. Regulation 26 amends paragraph 5 of schedule 5 and makes it clear that only the gross income of the second adult should be taken into account and that the capital of the liable person should be ignored. So the capital rule will not apply to the second adult rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington raised several points on the second adult rebate, including publicity. My Department has produced a clear and concise leaflet on council tax benefits, which was made available to the public last December. It is available from post offices, local authorities and DSS local offices. We intend to make a comprehensive information pack on council tax benefits available shortly to advisory groups, such as citizens advice bureaux. I shall send a copy of that to all hon. Members so that they know what is more generally available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A series of advertisements is planned in local, regional and free press in March, April and May to publicise the help that will be available under the council tax benefit scheme. My departmental officials have also undertaken an ongoing programme of presentations on council tax benefit to professional and advisory bodies, such as the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation. Those presentations will help such organisations to provide accurate guidance to practitioners and potential claimants alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those measures, together with local authority initiatives to publicise the scheme in their own areas, constitute a comprehensive and carefully targeted publicity campaign on all aspects of council tax beneift, including second adult rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not be forgotten that the system of second adult rebate is designed to work on a similar basis to non-dependant deductions under housing benefit, which local authorities have operated for many years. There is no reason to believe that, even though this is a new benefit scheme, the administrative difficulties about which the hon. Gentleman warned us will come to pass. Its operation will be similar to that of the non-dependant deduction work that is done by local authorities, upon which it is based. I hope that that will help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an optimistic view, which is not shared by the local authorities that must administer the scheme. They recognise that the poll tax element of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
council tax perpetuates an administrative headache and that the Government have not learnt the lessons of the poll tax. The personal element in the new calculation means that all the old problems—such as changes of circumstances and income, and the level of and responsibility for household income—will perpetuate a real administrative nightmare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has assured the Committee that that will not happen. We shall have to wait and see, but, if my information from local authorities is correct, the Minister may rue the day that the Government chose not to abolish the personal, poll tax element in the rating system and return exclusively to a property tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, but the new charge to be levied by local authorities is based on a decision of the House. Local authorities can be relied on to put their usual effort into the work. We have tried to meet some of the concerns expressed by the local authority associations about council tax benefit. We have simplified the rules governing second adult rebate and based them more tightly on the non-dependent deductions. That will assist local authorities and ease any possible administrative problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where the non-dependant has no income—for example, when he or she is not entitled to benefit and is not on a training scheme—how do the Government justify making a non-dependant deduction of £1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister appears to have been struck dumb, but he must say something at some time. It is very difficult for 
	<i>Hansard</i> to record silence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Hogg, but the hon. Gentleman has bowled me an interesting ball. The number of people caught in the circumstances that he describes will be very small. The scheme provides for the vast majority of people who find themselves in the circumstances of dependancy. The principle that people should make some contribution to the living expenses of the household is clear. That is why the contribution has been pitched at such a minimum level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister an example that cropped up at my surgery on Friday evening? It involved a family whose 19-year-old son is still at school. When he passed his 19th birthday, that household lost all entitlement to benefit in respect of him. Gone was the additional child element in income support, and his mother, who is a single parent, lost the one-parent benefit entitlement, as the son was the last child. There was a considerable drop in income. The son is treated as a non-dependant in the household yet he has no income. That is a clear anomally that creates injustice in such cases. We want to encourage young people to stay on at school, given the need for them to acquire extra skills and training in the light of the very real employment difficulties that they face. Surely the Government should recognise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that case, and can advise the hon. Gentleman that it may be dealt with by means of a grant from the local authority. The cut-off point is not new, and the reasons for having it at 19 have been discussed before. Only a few pupils continue in full-time education at that age. It has long been considered appropriate that local authority discretionary grants should cover the short period of time in which such circumstances obtain. I recently visited an under-25 centre in Camden to discuss the point. In the past, money has been available to cover the circumstances that I described. It is wrong to claim that no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
income is available. Local authorities have covered those circumstances in the past. That is one of the reasons for the discretionary grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to consider the regulations, and I do not wish to be sidetracked, but I shall give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise because I have little voice with which to make my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group to which the Minister alluded is larger than he admitted. Some youngsters will always fall into that group,—for example, those who take three years in the sixth form. That often happens with young people who were bilingual earlier in life, and who take a longer time to reach the same standard of educational achievement as other pupils. Another group consists of those who are not expected to study A-levels, but make a spurt in achievement when they are 14, 15 or 16 and, with three years in the sixth form, are able to complete A-levels and go on to higher education. Under the present system, a letter from the school to state that the child is legitimately in full-time education means that the child pays no poll tax. The groups that I have just described will be in a worse financial position under the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be no deduction, for a student. I shall try to reply to the point made by the hon. Member for Withington by letter. I am not sure whether there will be a deduction in the circumstances that he described. The letter will be made available to other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make progress on other matters. The hon. Gentleman raised a point about a disparity about who is counted as paying rent between the provisions of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 and those of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. I am unclear about whether such a disparity exists. I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman by letter about that highly technical matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich made a point about eligible rent. The change is beneficial. Payments made to a third party, which are treated as the claimant's income or capital, and used for day-to-day living expenses, including rent; and regular charitable and voluntary payments, which are intended or used for the same day-to-day expenses, are taken into account, subject to the £10 disregard. In housing benefit and community charge benefit, it was always intended that rent should refer to the rent for which housing benefit is payable; that is the net rent after all deductions have been made for service charges, high rents, water charges and non-dependant deductions. The regulations currently refer to "eligible rent", which means the net rent before any deduction is made for non-dependants. The amendment to the regulations, which is reflected in the housing benefit regulations, will ensure that the rent after deductions for non-dependants is the amount that is taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the ceiling is unnaturally low. The permitted total has applied in housing benefit circumstances since April 1988, when it replaced a limit of 10 per cent. of total local authority benefit expenditure. The reduction in the permitted total reflected the removal of local schemes provision for disregarding all or some of war disablement or war widows pensions by local authorities.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The permitted total should be sufficient to allow local authorities to use it carefully to help many people. The provision has not been widely known. It is possible that people who have found themselves in difficulty were unaware of the discretionary power of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, local authorities may be prepared to say more about the power because people may find themselves attracted to it, and could receive assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's point about contracting out, all decisions on benefits have to be made by the authority, not a contractor. At present, the Government encourage authorities that wish to do so to consider contracting out of the administration procedure for housing benefit but not out of the decision-making procedure. In a speech in Weston-super-Mare the other week, I made it clear that the Government believe that the decision-making power remains entirely with the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adjudication, including adjudication on payments under the permitted total order, will be a matter for the adjudication officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that there is great scope for administrative complications if claimants realise that they have the entitlement to seek additional payment? The hon. Gentleman has rightly accepted that there may be problems because people were unaware of the right. I hope that he agrees that the Government, as well as local authorities, should try to make people more aware. If the public do become aware and seek additional payment, if administration is handled by a contractor it is he with whom they will mainly deal. Will they go to him, or will they be told that they must apply to the local authority? Will not there inevitably be scope for administrative confusion between local authority and contractor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so when there has been some practise. The provision is new; the Government wish local authorities to test it to see how they fare because, in some instances, practical, day to day difficulties are solved by practise and by devising means of ensuring that they do not recur. I do not necessarily see difficulty in a contractor being approached about a decision that may be the responsibility of the local authority, rather than his. It is hardly an overwhelming problem that cannot be surmounted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to have been able to discuss the technical nature of the amending regulations and the order. Some comments went slightly wider than the provisions, as is inevitable with such issues. I am glad to be able to give clarification on some of the points raised. I shall write to hon. Members on matters which are not clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should be pleased that an independent survey of local authority preparations for the implementation of council tax benefit gives me every reason to believe that the new scheme will be smoothly and successfully introduced. The survey, which was based on interviews with each local authority, confirms that they are well prepared to give an effective benefit service from April. The Committee will wish to join me in praising the hard work and dedication of local authorities and their staff that has made this possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Council tax benefit is a new scheme and the Committee will expect us to monitor its progress. We shall do so regularly and frequently to ensure that it achieves the objectives outlined to the Committee, and to the House previously.
