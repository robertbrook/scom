	<i>Amendment proposed [11 March],</i> No. 273, in page 143, line 6, to leave out paragraph 2.—[
	<i>Mr. Gould.</i>]</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 143, line 33, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and all proceedings of the designated agency and its members, officers and servnts in the performance of those functions, including the submission of any evidence by third parties which may be relevant to those proceedings, shall be absolutely privileged".</p></blockquote>
The amendment extends the provisions of paragraph 3 of schedule 7, which provide immunity to the Securities and Investments Board. It is important that that immunity be extended—I believe the Securities and Investments Board takes this view—to cover third parties who give evidence to the SIB in matters relevant to the fulfillment of its functions. In the present provisions, any such evidence would not be protected by absolute privilege, although qualified privilege would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) pointed out, qualified privilege is not an adequate protection in such matters. He quoted, as did Professor Gower in part II of his report at page 23, a passage from a judgment by the Master of the Rolls in the Hasselblad case:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is only the very rich, the very foolish, the very malicious or the very dedicated who will knowingly put themselves in a position in which they have to defend a libel action even with the benefit of qualified privilege as a possible defence. The anxieties would be enormous".</p></blockquote>
That summarises the problem that would face a third party who felt obliged or was requested to give evidence but feared that such evidence might leave him open to an action for libel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide an additional protection to those co-operating with the SIB and would help the SIB to carry out its functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two aspects to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). The first is the conferring of absolute privilege on the agency, and the second is the extension of absolute privilege to third parties who make complaints or draw matters to the attention of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained why it would be undesirable to extend absolute privilege. The hon. Gentleman concentrated on the question of third parties and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
importance of not deterring them from coming forward to the agency. I recognise that that is important and is a matter of great concern, but third parties should be confident about approaching the agency because of the qualified privilege, which is the standard way of protecting people in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people have qualified privilege, and as long as their allegations are not actuated by malice, they may with confidence bring to the agency matters that should be drawn to its attention. That is the way in which protection is given to people in a like position over a wide range of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be undesirable to give an absolute privilege so that people who were actuated by malice could make charges to the agency, however wide, ill-founded or malicious. To give such people absolute protection would confer on them a privilege that is not conferred in other areas. It my view such a privilege is neither necessary nor desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that qualified privilege is generally the regime applying in similar circumstance in other fields, but the Minister is not giving sufficient weight to cases such as my example of the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in the Hasselblad case about the severe limitations on and concerns of people who rely on qualified privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to say that he took a similar line on previous issues and persuaded the Committee to support him, and no doubt he will do so now. Before I withdraw the amendment, I repeat in passing the question of general immunities. Earlier the Minister refused such immunities to self-regulating organisations. I hope that he will consider his refusal in the light of the strong representations which he is now receiving from potential SROs, especially in the light of the amendment to clause 12 on the power of the SIB to impose a rule change. But you, Sir Michael, will pull me up for being out of order if I pursue that line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed with the Minister's reply because he did not give full weight to the importance of allowing people to enjoy absolute privilege as a condition for making SIB's role effective, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 144, line 4, leave out sub-paragraph (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) A designated agency shall—

	<ol>

	<li>send the Secretary of State a copy of any guidance issued by the agency which is intended to have continuing effect and is issued in writing or other legible form; and</li>

	<li>give him written notice of any amendment, revocation of or addition to guidance issued by it;</li></ol>
but notice need not be given of the revocation of guidance other than such as is mentioned in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) above or of any amendment or addition which does not result in or consist of such guidance as is there mentioned.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 267.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are technical amendments concerning guidance intended to have continuing effect, issued in writing or other legible form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 96(9) already provides for a body to furnish the Secretary of State with a copy of any draft guidance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
that it proposes to issue when it becomes a designated agency. The guidance issued also needs to be copied to the Secretary of State and the amendment to schedule 7 will provide for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Schedule 9 is amended as proposed, it will correspondingly require a transferee body to furnish copies of its guidance to the Secretary of State and to the chief registrar of friendly societies or to the registrar of friendly societies for Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general terms, we support the provisions of chapter XII, which deal with restrictive practices, because we believe that they have struck the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, anxiety has been expressed by some self-regulating organisations and those who would be responsible for running recognised investment facilities—in particular, the stock exchange—about the ambit of the criterion indentified first in subsection (1) of clause 1, but repeated in subsequent clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That criterion—that restriction of competition should be allowed only to the extent that is necessary for the protection of investors—is perfectly acceptable. However, there may be a powerful reason for restricting competition by way of regulation of a recognised investment exchange on the ground that the orderly conduct of the market requires it. Unless that is specified directly in the Bill, the stock exchange—or some other body—may fall foul of the restrictive practices legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that the orderly conduct of the market is subsumed by the general concept of the protection of the investor. I understand that argument, but it makes the concept of protection of the investor very wide because one could start to say that what is for the protection of the investor includes everything connected with the proper organisation of the market. That imports a very general criterion that could override the vast bulk of the restrictive practices legislation. I am sure that that is not what the Minister intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
I believe that the Minister intends the clause to mean that, in general, practices pursued by, say, a recognised investment exchange should not go any further than is strictly necessary to protect the interests of the investor. If he is to extend that concept to general questions of running the market in an orderly way, he is widening that criterion rather too far. The point of the amendment is to suggest that it is better to have two separate criteria: first, the protection of the investment—which is a fairly comprehensible notion; and secondly, the orderly conduct of the market—which is equally comprehensible, but which does not bring in other categories. If I understand the Minister's nods and winks correctly he may wish to argue that those other categories would be brought within the general concept of protecting the investor. That would be too wide an interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the valid point made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), we need also to consider the public interest, as is suggested by the amendments in my name. The Committee will be aware that at several stages of the Bill, I have been anxious to protect—and increase the protection for—the consumer interest. That is an important part of what we should be doing. However, there is a balancing consideration, we should not go too far down that line by making the legislation so restrictive that it inhibits the market and makes an unwelcoming climate that could drive away business that might otherwise be transacted here. I wish, therefore, to amend chapter XII, especially this clause, to impose on the Secretary of State an obligation to consider not only the consumer interest—which is vitally important—but the development of the market, and what may be in the national interest in terms of bringing business into the country. That is a difficult balance to strike, and I shall be interested to hear the comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not without significance that the attack on the clause comes from opposite directions. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests that he is anxious that the Secretary of State's power to allow the anti-competitive practices, or practices that would otherwise be regarded as undesirable from the point of view of competition, may be too wide, whereas my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) suggests that it may be too narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not claim that there is no distinction between the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and myself on this point, but the purpose of my amendment is to widen the criteria. I was anxious that I might be anticipating the Minister's argument, that the existing criterion was sufficiently wide to encompass my amendment. If that were so, I was anxious that it might be so wide as to go too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, and justifies the point that I was seeking to make. My answer to both the hon. Member for Dagenham and my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West is that the language used in the clause is sufficiently wide to satisfy both their reservations. As, on this occasion, I am occupying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
the middle ground, it is perhaps as well that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) is not present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered carefully the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West and investigated whether the language used in the clause would meet his legitimate anxiety, that it might be necessary or desirable for the Secretary of State to take into account the development of markets. But, as that involves, by definition, markets which will be used by investors and, therefore, have investors' interests at the heart of the possibility, I am assured that his anxiety will be enveloped within the language of the clause. That may mean that I fall foul of the views of the hon. Member for Dagenham, and that the language of the clause goes a little wider than he would like, although he was originally concerned that it did not go as wide as he wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such curious consequences sometimes follow, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments as the language in the clause is sufficient to meet all reasonable concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer briefly to a matter, with which I intend to deal in greater detail under another clause, in reply to the comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary and in the context of the wish of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) to include the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in the public interest",</p></blockquote>
in clause 101(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know whether chapter XII complies with the requirements of the Treaty of Rome. Clause 101, and most of the other clauses concerned, are based on articles 85 to 94 of that treaty. I have spoken briefly with the officials of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary, and shall be grateful for further guidance from my hon. and learned Friend when I raise the matter formally under clause 104.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will not be a discussion on that clause now, because we are debating clause 101.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for his careful consideration. Although I remain slightly doubtful that we are doing the right thing, I shall accept his learned judgment on trust. However, we may in future need to examine how such matters are handled in practice, and, in particular, how the director general of fair trading handles his brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pretend to be as trusting as the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). However, I am at least realistic about the issue, and do not believe that we should press it to a vote. I suspect that the opinions of the Minister and his hon. Friends may not differ very greatly from mine on this question. I shall be satisfied if the Minister can assure us that the provision meets the real anxiety of the stock exchange and other bodies. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REPORTS BY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FAIR TRADING</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 79, line 7, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"above; and

	<ol>

	<li>consult with the Securities and Investment Board unless it has been designated as an agency in pursuance of section 96;</li>

	<li>Consult with the Governor for the time being of the Bank of England; and (iii)".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The director general of fair trading will have an extraordinary, almost omnipotent, role in advising the Secretary of State whether to refuse to make, or refuse leave to make, a recognition order. Although the role of the director general of fair trading is very important, there may be a need for rather wider consultation. I am convinced that the director general should be consulted; I have been concerned all along to protect the consumers' interest. But if we consider the implications for the wider development of the market, it becomes clear that other people should also be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before clause 96 was amended, I had proposed a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult SIB. If SIB is already the designated agency, that will not be necessary. However, perhaps the Secretary of State should consider the matter with the governor of the Bank of England, who has an important role to play in giving advice on the development of the market. There may be others with whom it may be considered desirable that the Secretary of State should consult besides merely a person who will represent the consumer interest. I shall appreciate my hon. and learned Friend's observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the opportunity, before answering the specific point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), to say a word about the concepts underlying chapter XII.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chapter applies a different system of competition scrutiny from that in the existing legislation. Perhaps the most important point is that it replaces the judgment of the restrictive practices court by decisions of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State or agency may recognise, or give leave to recognise, an SRO, an investment exchange or a clearing house, and he may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
delegate powers to a designated agency if all the relevant criteria for recognition or delegation are fulfilled and it appears to the Secretary of State after advice from the director general that the rules of those bodies do not have the effect, or are not intended or likely to have the effect, of significantly restricting, distorting or preventing competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the rules do appear to have such an effect, the Secretary of State must refuse to recognise, or give leave for the recognition of, the relevant body unless satisfied that the investor protection requirement is met. The same applies mutatis mutandis to delegation to a designated agency. This special regime has been introduced because the normal competition provisions do not provide a suitable basis for reaching decisions on the sensitive balance between competition and investor protection. Such decisions should not be taken by a specialist body such as the restrictive practices court. So the Bill reserves all decisions on the balance to the Secretary of State.

I believe it to be the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West to require the Secretary of State to consult both the Securities and Investments Board and the governor of the Bank of England as well as the director general of fair trading before deciding whether a self-regulating organisation, investment exchange or clearing house should be recognised, or indeed, before he makes a delegation order. The status of the director general in chapter XII, which deals with the prevention of restrictive practices, is clear: his function is to consider the relevant rules and regulations, guidance or arrangements, and advise the Secretary of State on the competition implications. Clause 105 gives the director general certain powers to enable him to carry out this function. Clause 104 makes explicit provision for the Secretary of State's consideration of the director general's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is required to have regard to that report, but he is not bound by it. It is for him to consider the effects on investors. When the Secretary of State is considering the director general's report, he is free to consult whoever he wishes about the contents of that report. I am sure that he will want to consult. He could consult the board, the governor of the Bank of England or any other body or person concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the desire of my hon. Friend to see that the Secretary of State's decisions under the legislation should be as fully informed as possible, but the existing provisions allow for that and the amendment is not necessary for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to add one note of caution on the singling-out in the amendment of the chairman of the board and the governor of the Bank of England. It is extremely important that, in considering the balance between competition and investor protection on the advice of the director general of fair trading, the Secretary of State should not be regarded as having a particular duty to give effect to the interests of the City in terms of what has sometimes been described as the cosy club when he has wider considerations to take into account and a wider duty to fulfil. By singling out and mentioning specifically only the board and the governor there would be a danger that that impression might be created. I am anxious that that impression should not be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
The role of the Secretary of State in the matter is as the guardian of competition and of the consumer. Of course, that has to be balanced against the need to protect investors, but the Secretary of State should consult widely—as I am sure any Secretary of State would in the circumstances—before taking any decisions on the advice of the director general. Therefore, I am anxious not to give the impression that his consul tations should be channelled in one direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power in the clause is more than sufficient, as it allows the Secretary of State to consult whoever he wishes, so I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause and, indeed, the whole of chapter XII will give rise to discussion and controversy when the Bill is applied in practice, because some of the chapter's provisions, which arise from clause 104, can be construed as cutting across articles 85 to 94 of the Treaty of Rome. Opinions may differ on the matter and it will probably come to the courts under the reference of article 177 to the court of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 2(4) of the European Communities Act 1972 makes existing law and any future enactment subject to the Treaty of Rome, thus including the Bill. Mr. Justice Graham said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"relevant Common Market Law should be applied in this country and should, where there is a conflict, override English law".</p></blockquote>
I do not want to impose inhibitions on the development of the market merely because of some theological interest in the Treaty of Rome. I am a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation and I take a pragmatic and constructive approach, as I showed in the recent debate on developments in the European Community. As I pointed out in that debate, competition policy, commercial interests, investors protection, and the rest are intimately bound up with the progress of the whole of our economy, so we must provide for a consistent regime, as suggested in chapter 8, "Competition", in the White Paper. Paragraph 8.3 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government therefore propose to make the Secretary of State rather than the courts the final arbiter of the competition implications of the rules of Boards or recognised organisations."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 8.2 sets out the Government's policy:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where competition is inhibited, there is less freedom of choice. Only if the British financial services industry is subject to a regulatory system which promotes competition will it succeed in meeting the challenge posed by other financial centres."</p></blockquote>
It would be difficult if, in attempting to exclude aspects of competition law—by which I mean the Competition Act 1980 and the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which would apply because of, and must be construed against, the underlying provisions of the Treaty of Rome—we were to allow the Commission to outflank the director general of fair trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised that matter with the director general because, having come to a provisional conclusion, I thought it wise to seek further guidance and to obtain another view. In his letter of 11th March he states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As to your second question, in so far as the rules and regulations of the various recognised organisations affect trade between member states they will be subject to the provisions of the treaty"—</p></blockquote>
I do not dispute that; it is my whole point—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The bodies that find themselves in that position and consider their rules and regulations may infringe articles 85/86 will need to approach the Commission under the established procedures and carry out any necessary negotiations to secure the required clearance. We will, of course, be ready to help this process in any way we can but essentially the initiative in the application of the Community competition law to the organisation's rules and regulations rests with the Commission."</p></blockquote>
I expect the Minister to say that we are not cutting across the treaty of Rome, but providing a tailor-made regime for financial services to help market development and provide a balance between competition and investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people would question the conduct of business rules and the mass of self-regulatory apparatus in the Bill. They might approach the Commission if they did not agree with the SIB or with the Secretary of State. Therefore, it is important to put this matter on record and to consider it further between now and Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In so far as the rules and practices of recognised bodies may affect trade between member states, they will be subject to the competition rules of the treaty, especially articles 85 and 86. However, there is no reason to believe that rules that will meet the investor protection criteria in the Bill will infringe the European Community competition rules. In a recent series of decisions, for example, the Commission has taken the view that rules for the regulation of certain of London's terminal markets do not infringe article 85. But should there be any doubt, or should the rules be such that they clearly require exemption, the primary responsibility for obtaining clearance from the Commission will rest with the bodies concerned. This chapter of the Bill is not intended to implement the treaty competition rules, because they have direct effect. Like the rest of the United Kingdom competition law, it seeks to provide a domestic regime. In the event of a conflict between the two, the treaty rules prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speical regime provided in the chapter follows closely the provisions of the Competition Act 1980. As
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
far as I am aware, it has not been suggested that that Act conflicts with our treaty obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can cast my mind back to my hon. and learned Friend's reply to the amendment that is the subject of the debate, I must say that I am disappointed with his comments in response to my amendment. I understand that there is room for a difference of opinion on the subject, but I am not convinced that an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult more widely would necessarily impute the sort of disadvantageous interpretation that my hon. and learned Friend suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State would consult considerably more widely than merely the director general of fair trading, and I am a little anxious that the role of the director general, as set out in chapter XII, attributes to him a much more central importance that I wish to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not disposed to press the matter to a Division and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 79, line 29, after "shall", insert

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 190, in page 79, line 33, after "above", insert

	<p>and insert "shall, when so directed".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments deal with the role of director general of fair trading and especially with his role when he is considering the necessity for any amendment or addition to, or revocation of, the rules and regulations of an SRO. The powers given to him, under subsections (4) and (5), are extremely wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be important for the director general to have such a wide role in relation to a number of SROs, which will be new organisations, perhaps inexperienced in their activities and in controlling their markets. But we may run into difficulty in respect of some putative SROs with wide experience, such as the stock exchange, because the director general may make a proposal that could operate to the disadvantage of a market that has operated extremely well for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the previous recommendations of the director general, with regard to commission and fee levels in professions, for example have not produced the result that he envisaged. I am thinking especially of my profession, where his ruling, that fees and commissions were anti-competitive, and were, therefore, outlawed, resulted in a universal rise in those fees and commissions. The same unfortunate result may occur in respect of the stock exchange.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did not the Minister make it clear that he is not required to comply with the recommendations of the director general? Are not the

	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
amendments superfluous, therefore, as the Minister may ignore the recommendations of the director general?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that they are because, at present, the Minister is not obliged to consult anyone else. I would prefer that the director general should carry out that role—where public anxiety has been expressed in the House, for example—and look into those matters on the Secretary of State's direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the director general has a roving brief to look into anything that he likes, whenever he likes. I shall deal with the point in greater detail under clause 151, but, if he makes a recommendation, there is no obligation to publish his report, or for anyone to take note of the comments of the SRO concerned, which may disagree with the recommendations. At the very least we should know what is in a report and give the SRO the right to comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment all the initiative on the matter lies with the director general. The Secretary of State is not obliged to consult anybody else. The balance is wrong. I do not quibble about the involvement of the director general, but we must get the balance right between the operation of the market, which is in the national interest, and the protection of the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that the regime of chapter XII does not extend the powers of the director general of fair trading beyond their limits under existing law. It merely provides a different machinery. Instead of going to the restrictive trade practices court or to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as at present, the director general will take his advice to the Secretary of State. He does not have any additional powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some merit in the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) made about the amendment that he has not yet moved, that the director general should be required to publish his report before the Secretary of State takes a decision. I am prepared to look at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a dispute arose during the procedure that my hon. and learned Friend has outlined about whether the Secretary of State and the director general of fair trading were properly considering the rules on competition—in other words, if there were a dispute about whether they were fully carrying out the provisions of the Treaty of Rome—what would happen? We want it to work effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a provisional answer, subject to further consideration, to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision-making process will be subject to the normal means of challenge in the courts. The Secretary of State's decision would be taken on, or would take into account, the advice of the director general. He is not, contrary to the suggestion of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), free to ignore that advice, although he is not obliged to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But he can ignore it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not obliged to accept it. The Secretary of State's decision can be challenged in the courts on judicial review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests, in the same way as any other decision. All the elements of domestic and European Community law that bear on the decision may be canvassed before the courts. That is my provisional answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) would restrict the ability of the director general of fair trading to make a report to the Secretary of State. That was not the intention of the White Paper, as set out in paragraph 8.6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have given—we need not go into them in detail—it would not be appropriate to restrict the role of the director general in a way that would not apply under the general competition legislation. Competition is an extremely important aspect of the services—it is one of the greatest safeguards for the users—and we want it to be given full weight in the implementation of the investor protection regime that the Bill contemplates. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary for his explanation of the Department's view. In response to his comment that the chapter gives the director general no wider powers than he enjoys under the existing law, I would only say that in my view, the powers that he enjoys under the existing law are too wide. However, we have no opportunity to debate that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of my hon. and learned Friend's adumbration of what he may say in response to my amendment No. 151, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 80, line 7, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) The Director shall in such manner as he considers appropriate publish any report under subsections (2), (4) and (5) above stating the reasons for his opinion. Any person affected by the report may within twenty-eight days of publication of the report make representations to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State shall consider such representations before deciding whether to exercise his powers under sections 101(3). 102(4) or 103(3).".</p></blockquote>
We have already touched upon the subject matter of this amendment. If the director general investigates in the way that he is permitted to under the clause, his report should be published and those who are affected by it should be given an opportunity to make their own observations on it. The Secretary of State should be obliged to consider those observations before he makes a decision about what should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee any longer; I shall listen eagerly to the response of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding positively to this amendment, may I take the opportunity of saying a word or two more about the director general's approach? It would be helpful to have that on the record of the Committee's proceedings.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
The director general, in several recent public statements, has given assurances on the approach that he intends to adopt in reviewing the practices of City bodies once they have been recognised. For example, he has made it plain that he believes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"cooperation is more efficient than confrontation."</p></blockquote>
In the last month, the Office of Fair Trading has approved for the purposes of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act the rules of the following bodies as having no significant effect on competition: NASDIM, the Issuing Houses Association, the Finance Houses Association, the Association of Independent Investment Managers and the Association of Stock and Share Dealers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that gives comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), and I shall certainly consider the possibility of imposing an obligation on the director general to publish his reports so that they can be the subject of general consideration before the Secretary of State takes decisions on those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am gratified by the response of my honourable and learned Friend the Under-Secretary, and I am also gratified to hear of the approach that the director general of fair trading intends to take with regard to SROs.

In view of the assurances that my honourable and learned Friend has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 197, in page 145, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A. Paragraph 17(1) of Schedule 1 to this Act does not apply to anything done by a regulated insurance company with respect to investments that are, or are to be, comprised in a fund maintained by it in respect of long term business under section 28(1)(b) of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 or under the provisions for corresponding purposes in the law of the member State in which it is established.'.</p></blockquote>
Following the Committee's decision that clause 21 should stand part of the Bill, the amendments that I originally tabled to clause 110 and to schedule 8 no longer made sense and so I have tabled new amendments. My purpose is to make the same point as before—that it would be an unacceptable anomaly if the management of the long-term funds of life offices were outside the scope of the scheme of regulation that we are instituting through the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technically, the funds belong to the life offices and, as such, would fall outside the scope of regulation. But in reality, the funds are the premiuns that are being managed on behalf of investors and it would be consistent with the general spirit of the Bill and our broader purposes that there should be adequate regulation of the conduct of investment management of those funds. The Government have accepted that principle in relation to pension schemes and it is embodied in clause 150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
As I mentioned in our debate on clause 21, it is not an insignificant consideration. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary confirmed in that debate that the long-term funds under management of the life funds are £125 billion. I welcome my hon. Friend's recognition that this is a "key issue" and his acknowledgement that there is a case for making an exception of the long-term funds of insurance companies, too, by bringing them properly within the scope of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I was pleased to find that after I had tabled my new amendments—perhaps due to a Freudian slip in the Public Bill Office—the amendments were found to be in the name of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary. I can only assume that that was a measure of the Government's good will towards what I am seeking to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments, taken together, would ensure that conduct of business rules could be made to govern the management of life funds by an insurance company that did not join an SRO. Breach of the rules could be punished by withdrawal of authorisation. Amendment No. 197 treats life funds as if they were not the property of the insurance company, so that dealings with them fall back into the definition of investment business as under part II of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 269 extends the rule-making power in clause 45 to that aspect of insurance companies' investment business. The amendments leave undisturbed the main structure of schedule 8, under which the Secretary of State retains to himself the power to regulate insurance companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening very carefully to the hon. Member's argument, but he is beginning to discuss the three amendments together. Is it his wish to discuss them together? If it is not, he must draw a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Sir Michael, and to the Committee. I assumed that we were taking the amendments together. If that would be for the convenience of the Committee, I should be grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I rule that we may also discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 269, in page 146, line 43, leave out paragraph (c) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) anything done or omitted with respect to investments that are, or are to be, comprised in a fund maintained in respect of long term business under section 28(1)(
	<i>b</i>) of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 or under the provisions for corresponding purposes in the law of the member state in which it is established;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) matters incidental to those mentioned in paragraphs (a), (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>) above".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 270, in page 148, line 37, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"business which is insurance business by virtue of section 95(c)(ii) of this Act"</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"any insurance business which is investment business within the meaning of the Financial Services Act 1986".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir Michael. Amendment No. 270 simply extends that rule-making power so that if conduct of business rules or other obligations under the Bill are not complied with, an insurance company can be prevented not only from managing pension funds, as paragraph 7(2) provides, but also from managing life funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
If that principle is acccepted, it will no doubt be necessary to give the Secretary of State a further power to vest the management of a company's life funds in a "fit and proper" person during any period in which the company itself is prevented by his direction from managing them. That would be a desirable addition to the Secretary of State's powers and would entail a further amendment to the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two reasons for tabling the amendments. I am anxious to ensure proper protection of policyholders, but I appreciate that that is not a simple undertaking. There would be an interpenetration of the legislation in the Bill with an existing body of insurance legislation, and I readily accept that it may not be simple to reconcile the two. None the less it is important to protect the interests of investors investing sums totalling perhaps £125 billion. I trust with every confidence that my hon. Friend will not retreat behind the technical difficulties in reconciling the two bodies of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, I wish to bring long-term investments in life insurance industry fully within the regulatory regime of investor protection that we are instituting and therefore to make them subject to the authority of the designating agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would tell the Committee what progress he has made on the consultation that he said was taking place when we debated clause 21, and which he hoped might be concluded by the time we debated clause 110 and schedule 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) for his further observations on the issue. I reassure him that we shall not retreat behind the technical defence of the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) is a great believer in inter-Member correspondence and I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon in good time before Report to tell him the results of our consultations, including those with some of the people behind the spirit of his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I should like to signal an aspect that is worth placing before the Committee. The fundamental point to stress is the fact that insurance contracts are, as many hon. Members have acknowledged, quite different from other collective forms of investment. The investor's right to a return on a long-term insurance policy arises not because the company is holding and managing assets that belong to the investor, as with unit trusts, but because the company has liabilities to that investor in the contract of insurance. The money that the investor pays is pooled with that of other investors in the company's long-term fund. For a with-profits long-term contract, there is no direct connection between what happens to that investor's money and his rights under the contract of insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the policy holder of a long-term with-profits insurance contract is looking for slightly different benefits from the investor who has an investment
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
Manager, quite apart from those elements of his contract that are purely for protection purposes. He is looking for some protection from the shorter-term ups and downs of the underlying investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a good year, when the market stands high, the company will declare a reversionary bonus. The policy holder is then entitled to that, when his policy matures, however the underlying investments stand on that day. They may have slumped, but that will not affect his entitlement to bonuses already declared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company and its actuary in declaring its bonuses must have regard to fairness between policy holders, and to the likely future ability of the company to pay. That is why the supervison of solvency is so essential. It also means that the investments of policy holders must be pooled, and it is their collective interest in solvency and the broad issues of fairness between them that must be addressed, not the fate of their own individual investments, which are not individually accounted for. Because life assurance has a different nature, it has a different system of supervision under the Insurance Companies Act 1982.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the basic argument is that there is already a regime directed towards this aspect of investor protection for investors in life companies. But it is a different regime, to take account of the pooled nature of this type of investment, which spreads risks between investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am conscious that I have set out one particular consideration. There are others, and we shall want to consider whether there are aspects of life offices' operations in this area that are not covered by the Bill as drafted that are relevant to investor protection, and which are not sufficiently covered by the existing regime for policyholder protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that there will be plenty of advance notice of the results of those considerations before Report. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONTRACTS MADE AFTER CONTRAVENTION OF S. Ill</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 86, line 24, after "be", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"at the rate, if any, received by or paid or payable to the insurance company in respect of any money paid or other property paid or transferred under the contract and subject to that minimum, shall be".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is directed at a very small point; nevertheless, it would be helpful to hear the Minister's views. Despite its attempt to protect the interests of the parties
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
involved, the provision, as drafted, makes it possible for the interest rate paid by the insurance company to be less than the actual rate that it has received. That would be extraordinary, as the insurance company would then be in contravention of clause 111. The amendment is designed to ensure that the minimum rate at which interest is paid is the rate which the insurance company is entitled to receive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After I have replied to the point that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has just made, may I also take this opportunity to respond to a point that he made earlier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any further provisions about the interest recoverable are necessary. If the parties cannot agree, the interest payable will be determined by the court, which can have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including with interest the insurance company has received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to bear in mind that the purpose of the provision is not that the insurance company should not make a profit out of the contract. The purpose is to restore the investor as nearly as possible to the position he would have been in, had he not entered into the contract. There are other provisions, in clause 56, which are designed to deprive an investment business of any profit improperly made as a result of the illegal promotion of investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also point out a curious effect of the proposed amendment? Strictly speaking, it could prevent the two parties from agreeing on a level of interest to be paid even if both parties were prepared to accept a particular figure. The reason for that is that the amendment seeks to set a minimum below which the two parties—or the court—cannot go. It would not be right for the law to prevent a settlement which would be acceptable to both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The due processes of the law are therefore more flexible than would be permitted by the amendment. However, I should like to refer to a point made earlier by the Law Society of Scotland on amendment No. 118, which has a linked interest with amendment No. 303. The question was whether the investor should be able to recover the fruits of property transferred to an unauthorised insurer just as he will receive interest on any money paid. Clauses 5 and 52 also deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of goodwill in the Committee, I should like to tell the hon. Member for Dagenham that we agree in principle that the investor should be able to recover the fruits of property. We are considering whether the wording adopted already provides for that. If it does not, we shall bring forward amendments on Report. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member on the other substantive point made by the Scottish Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In understood that it was in some way connected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to raise that latter point on clause stand part, and as the Minister recognises, it is exactly the point that we discussed on clauses 5 and 52. I am grateful for what the Minister said and I look forward to whatever amendment he might bring forward on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
However, I was less persuaded by the Minister's argument that the amendment would preclude the possibility of an agreement, because in many ways that was my intention. In some circumstances the insurance company and the party to a contract may not be as equal as they should be. The whole point of amendment No. 303 is to provide a minimum rate of interest so that no insurance company can overbear a party which has rights under the provision, and persuade it to accept a rate of interest lower than that received by the insurance company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I recognise two points made by the Minister. It is true that the court will always have the final word if the parties cannot agree, and one hopes that the court would take account of any actual interest rate paid. I also take the point that the purpose of the provision is not to take ill-gotten gains from the insurance company but to place the investor in the position that he would have been in but for the contract. I should have preferred to see specific reference in the provision to the actual rate of interest received, but I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr Oonagh McDonald 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The friendly societies have already been in contact with the Minister. The amendments which involve them are not on the amendment paper, although I believe that the Government are agreeable to some of the changes sought by the friendly societies. Perhaps the Minister will tell us later what his proposals are. The friendly societies say that some of their business is the same as that carried out by insurance companies, which are permitted to be part of the a self-regulatory organisation. The friendly societies wish to know whether they can be members of an SRO, at least for the purposes of insurance business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The friendly societies share interests with industrial insurance companies because they conduct similar business. Both types of organisation say that there are compensation provisions under the Insurance Companies Act and that cooling-off procedures are custom and practice. The friendly societies wish to know what rules will be brought foward and what expense they will incur as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady said, schedule 9 does not contain special provisions for friendly societies that are members of self-regulating organisations, but such provision is made in schedule 8 for insurance companies. However, that does not reflect a view that, uniquely among financial institutions, friendly societies should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
not be able to opt for self-regulation. That aspect of the system will help to answer many of the points made by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With some contrition I must admit that the provisions were simply not ready when the Bill was published, and we shall bring forward the necessary amendments in due course, prompted by the hon. Lady's timely reminder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also bring forward amendments on the industrial insurance issue. As usual, the amendments will be made known to the Committee in good time so that they can be considered later in our Committee proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL LISTING</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. We now come to parts IV and V of the Bill and, as you are aware, there is no opportunity for a part stand part debate. Therefore, it might be convenient for the Committee to examine the question before dealing with the part, rather than after. I wish to seek guidance from you, Sir Michael, or from the Minister about the Government's intentions in respect of parts IV and V.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the matter because, as Committee Members are aware, many expert bodies and interested people outside the Committee are anxious about the form of the provisions. There have been representations from legal bodies and solicitors, for example, but, perhaps most persuasively, the stock exchange itself has made powerful representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stock exchange has raised fundamental objections to some provisions in parts IV and V. I do not intend to say that I support all or any of those objections at this stage. However, the Committee must take great account of what the stock exchange says on those matters, because clearly it is to be the competent authority identified under the Bill to administer the provisions, and is to be given a great range of legal powers—including that of charging fees—with which to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are obliged to take account of what the stock exchange has to say. It says that legislation in this sphere is required, because the current situation is, to put it bluntly, a mess and must be put right in the Bill or in legislation in the near future, but it goes on to complain bitterly of inadequate consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister can reassure the Committee on that point. The stock exchange also complains that there is too little in the Bill of the detail that will be required to ensure that these matters will work in practice. It also points out that although it may be necessary to legislate, parts IV and V are not integral parts of the Bill; they need not be put in this legislation. The stock exchange urges that the Government should withdraw those parts and that further consultation
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
should take place and, if necessary and appropriate, further legislative provisions, not necessarily in the framework of this Bill, should be prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the length of my point of order, but if there is any chance that the Government are thinking of acceding to the stock exchange's request, we should be told before we examine the provisions in detail so that our examination is not futile. Can the Minister tell us his intentions and say whether he proposes any changes to the provisions that might mean that we should look at them in a different form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. The greater experience of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) no doubt led him to raise the matter in this way, but I tabled an amendment that sought to leave out clause 117, and had it been selected, I intended to make the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we all agree that legislation is needed to deal with issues in parts IV and V, they do not have' much to do with investor protection. There is no serious allegation that an inadequacy of our listing regulations is giving rise to difficulties for investors. I am worried about the lack of consultation and the fact that it does not fit with the rest of the Bill. I express my support for the point raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the difficulty. It has occurred previously when I have allowed debates to go slightly wide. I was a little perplexed. I realised that it came within the chapter but I could not see where I could have pointed the finger and said where the matter should be discussed. It is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not minded to allow a general debate on a point of order. Having said that, to lay the groundwork for the first amendment, I feel that it would be right for me to allow the debate to go rather wide, although some of the arguments have already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall bear in mind what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said in his point of order when we come to the first debate on his own amendment. I realise that the background is being laid for other amendments that may crop up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. I shall of course abide by any ruling you make. If you would prefer to have the matter dealt with in that way, so be it, but it may be for the general convenience of the Committee if I were to respond now in a general way on the point of order to the arguments that have been made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to move his amendment briefly. We can then bring it into the range of the debate, rather than of the point of order, and give the Minister an early opportunity to make his point. We shall, therefore, avoid the procedural difficulty and help the Committee in its work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 304, in page 90, line 8, leave out from "to" to "Schedule" in line 9 and insert—

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
The purpose of the amendment is clear. Instead of limiting the listing requirements to the range of investments specified in clause 117, a discretion should be allowed to extend the range, if—we cannot be sure that it would ever become relevant—a market should develop in other forms of investments specified in schedule 1. Clause 117 would then include the power to extend the listing requirements to those further forms of investments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have correctly understood your reply to the point of order, Sir Michael, it is permissible under the curtilage of the amendment to refer to the matters that we discussed earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make three points. First, I should be a little anxious if my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary acceded to suggestions that these parts be removed from the Bill. The provisions for listing and for offers of unlisted securities should be included in the Bill. The specific requirements laid down—the details of information sought and the criteria that the competent authority attaches to deciding whether the disclosure is sufficient to allow listing, thus giving the seal of approval to the integrity of the business concerned and the reporting of its accounts and results—are all matters relevant to the operation of a free and fair market, and designed in accordance with the general principle of investor protection. Therefore, these parts of the Bill appear to lie easily within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I understand—my hon. and learned Friend may clarify the point—that those parts of the Bill may be included partly as a result of the requirements of European legislation, under which we are bound in law to place common standards—to which I subscribe—promulgated in the European Community, in respect of the financial services market in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if we lose that opportunity, there may be dangers that separate legislation would have to wait until another Session of Parliament. It may also be used as a base for a considerable extension of the control of listings and may involve other matters with which the Bill deals—for example, takeover matters in clause 142—because, inevitably, requirements of disclosure for listing bear an analogy with requirements of disclosure in prospectuses, which brings us into the sphere of takeovers. I shall deal later in more detail with that clause and the relevant schedule, but there are strong arguments in both cases for retaining these parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth making those points before my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary replies, so that—with due respect to the points made by other Committee members—he is aware that the Committee is not unanimous in its view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I make it clear that, because I raised the matter on a point of order, I did not wish to get invovled in the merits of the arguments. I disclaimed any such intention when I rehearsed the arguments of the stock exchange. My point was about the proper proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now the hon. Gentleman is released.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so. I am still reluctant to express a view on the arguments' merits. In explaining the arguments of the stock exchange to the Committee, I was pointing out that, if the Committee acceded to those arguments, it might find itself dealing with provisions that are no longer on the table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the stock exchange's advice, which the Opposition do not necessarily endorse—indeed, I sympathise with the views expressed by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson)—we must know what the Minister's response will be to that advice, or we might find ourselves working in the dark to no great purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) for his remarks. I agree with him that it is important that the matter should remain in the Bill and be dealt with in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may assist the Committee if I say something about the history and the present position on the matter. Part IV is of great importance to companies, investors, and practitioners of company law. Until 1984 admission to listing on the stock exchange was a private matter between the listed issuer and the stock exchange. Three European Community directives made listing more statutory. They covered the conditions for admission to stock exchange listing, the requirements for drawing up, scrutiny, and distribution of listing particulars to be published for admission, and the information to be published on a regular basis by listed companies. They were implemented in the United Kingdom by the Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations 1984, which took the unusual course of simply letting the directives speak, by incorporating their texts and not adapting them to United Kingdom usage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV replaces the Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations 1984 as the means of implementing the directives. Some have argued that that is unnecessary and will cause further disruption and uncertainty. We also dislike further changes in the law. We have not made the changes with a view to being radical, but because better statutory underpinning is needed and because the Bill, which makes major reforms, should integrate listing into the general law dealing with offers, for the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directives had to be implemented within a tight time scale to comply with European Community obligations and to remove damaging uncertainty. Therefore, they had to be implemented by secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972. That imposed limitations. For example, the directives contained minimum requirements, but allowed stricter ones to be imposed. The rules for stock exchange listing, the Yellow Book, are in many ways stricter than the directives. The European Communities Act 1972 did not allow the stock exchange to be empowered to impose additional legal requirements that would go beyond the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are deep legal waters and I am not asserting that the arguments of those who maintain that the regulations are a secure foundation for the Yellow Book are untenable, but there is considerable doubt about it. Such doubt is undesirable and listing should not remain divorced from the legal hinterland to which it belongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
In the long term, security can be obtained only by having primary legislation that gives the stock exchange, as the competent authority, power to make rules to implement the minimum requirements of the directives and the additional requirements that they allow. That is what we seek to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our consultations with the stock exchange and others, including the Law Society, suggest that they are not worried about the principle of reintegrating listing with the legal hinterland to which it belongs. By that I mean attaching similar standards of prospectus disclosure and liability for all flotations whether they involve listing or not. That covers both parts IV and V of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 6.13 of part II of his report, Professor Gower states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is to be hoped that … there will … be a thorough rationalisation and the eradication of long-standing anomalies so that material misstatements and … omissions … will give rise to the same … liabilities whatever the type of prospectus in which they occur."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say that an extension of the general duty in article 4(1) of the Listing Directive to
	<br><blockquote><p>"other types of prospectus will promote both standardisation and a welcome simplification of the law."</p></blockquote>
Although the stock exchange expressed doubts about the principle of and the need for legislation, it is now more reconciled to the appropriateness of including these matters in the Bill. Its previous reluctance inhibited consultation, but that is now taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worries expressed can be accommodated within the provisions of parts IV and V. Those parts will require amendment and we are anxious to respond to all reasonable worries. Some Government amendments have been tabled, but as discussions are continuing we shall need to table some amendments on Report. When we discuss the amendments already tabled, I shall refer to those consultations. I hope that we shall be able to meet all legitimate worries and that the Committee will feel that we have responded in a reasonable and flexible manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I object strongly to the role that the Whip plays during our proceedings. I say that with due respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. Hughes). Amendments are moved and clauses debated, and there are agreements through the usual channels about the timetabling of Bills. These are informal arrangements. This Bill was not timetabled as many Bills are, although there was a sitting motion. If we had known a week or two ago that we would arrive at this juncture, some debates which were truncated for the benefit of the Committee might have been extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was careful to blame the stock exchange for the delay in consultations because of its unwillingness to accept certain principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I note the careful selection of words. However, the Minister appeared to be blaming the stock exchange. Perhaps the stock exchange is responsible, but that should have no influence on the way that we debate the Bill and the time allocated to each clause. I understood that we

were to debate these matters, but it seems that we are not to do so.

Moreover, if the likes of me did not rise to our feet, we might have suspended the sitting at midday. We might have lost an hour that we could have used previously to debate other amendments to which some of us would have liked to contribute.

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing what is in the Bill at the present time. Ministers or other hon. Members may say that they will seek to change the Bill at a later stage, but that has nothing to do with the Committee and is procedures. We must discuss the Bill as it stands. Indications about what may happen later may be given during our discussions, but that is not a matter for me or for the Committee to go further into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary has given some of the background and has explained that until 1984 such matters were dealt with privately between the stock exchange and those seeking admission to listing. In 1984 the directives were implemented, exceptionally, wholesale by means of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth looking a little more carefully at what happened subsequently. The White Paper was not unambiguous, it referred to the stock exchange listing regulations in paragraph 13.4, but it did not make it clear that the Government proposed in the Bill to reimplement the regulations by means of primary legislation. Equally Professor Gower's report said that paragraph 13.4 and seemed almost to imply that nothing would be done. He rightly went on to say that paragraphs 13.1 to 13.3 made the position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of whether the White Paper and Professor Gower's response were clear, there was an unfortunate breakdwon in communications between the DTI
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
and the stock exchange. The stock exchange is the competent authority. I do not want to cast blame on either side, but it seems incredible that there could be such misunderstanding that the stock exchange failed to comprehend that the Bill would include parts IV and V.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Nicholas Goodison, the chairman of the stock exchange, told me and my hon. Friends that the Bill was the first he knew that the Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations 1984 were to be implemented in the Bill by means of primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the initial response of the stock exchange that it needed more time to consider the measure. It involves major changes and goes beyond the requirements of the directives. It is not an integral part of investor protection and should be dealt with—if at all—by means of a separate Bill. I understand that, but I agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary that it is right to put it into primary legislation and that it is unprecendented—and unsatisfactory—for it to be incorporated by regulation in the way that it has been previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is clear that there has been an unfortunate breakdown of communications between the stock exchange and the Government, and I believe that it is unreasonable to blame the stock exchange for the Government's inability to make progess in the Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, it may be useful if I endorse the remarks made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), but more particularly, ask the Minister precisely what he suggests the Committee should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of what the Minister said seemed to be that the Committee was not in a position to deal effectively with the provisions of parts IV and V. That leaves open various possibilities. I am not an expert in such matters, but the Minister may wish to move a new motion to enable us to deal with the parts of the Bill in a different order. Or is he suggesting that we should not move the amendments that are tabled, in the expectation that further amendments will be tabled on Report? That would inevitably have consequences for the length of time we may need to spend on the Report stage of the Bill, given that there will be many other amendments tabled that we have not yet had the opportunity to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has suggested that, for whatever reason, the provisions are clearly not in their final form and will be substantially changed. Therefore, it is difficult for the Committee to spend time on them, knowing that they will be changed. We need to know exactly what the Minister proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith)? I simply do not accept that there is any other interpretation of what chapter 13 of the White Paper said about public issues and takeovers than that it was a clear statement that those matters would be dealt with in this Bill. That is on public record and it is unnecessary for me to quote from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other matters on public record—my hon. Friend referred to some of Profossor Gower's
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
observations—but I need not rely on those. The language of the White Paper is clear and unequivocal and there was absolutely no basis for any misunderstanding or any reason why anybody—including the stock exchange—should be unaware that it was the Government's intention to legislate in this Bill for those activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the proceedings of the Committee, there is no difficulty. Of course the Committee can proceed with its business, of course it can discuss the amendments that have been tabled, and of course I shall respond to them. I was merely giving advance notice, in response to the point of order of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), about the context in which I shall reply to the various amendments. I shall respond in detail to the anxieties expressed in the amendments. I shall outline the extent to which the government regard those anxieties as justified, and whether we are likely to bring forward amendments to deal with particular anxieties. I may say that the Government are prepared to accept some amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious, as ever, to be helpful and to describe the context in which the discussions will take place, but there is no absolutely no reason whatever why the proceedings of the Committee should not continue in a perfectly normal way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with what my honourable and learned Friend has said about what is in the White Paper. It is crystal clear, and I am surprised that there is any serious doubt about it. Whether the scope of the legislation is inside or outside, or adds to or subtracts from, the directives is a matter of interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's support. I conclude my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend said that there was no room for misunderstanding, but clearly there was a misunderstanding. What consultation took place with the stock exchange, before the Bill was published, about the contents of parts IV and V?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department's view that these matters were to be dealt with in the legislation has always been made clear and the provisions that deal with them were sent to the stock exchange for its views as soon as they were drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting to the nub of the matter. It seems that the Minister has failed to consult the stock exchange in a reasonable way. Perhaps he is now trying to put a gloss on it by blaming the stock exchange. I heard the Minister blame the stock exchange; he said that it was willing to accept that it was to be in the legislation. He has now hurriedly had to start consulting the stock exchange to find out how much amendment it requires. Clearly it will come up with amendments within the next few weeks and the Minister will have to table them on Report. The reason why he has pleaded for time today to deal with these matters is that he has been insufficiently briefed because the consultation exercise has not been gone through. The Minister has been clearly negligent in failing to ensure that proper consultative procedures were followed before the Bill came to the Committee. If the Minister had conducted his Department properly this would never have happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary deserves a little more support. I briefly endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). Chapter 13 of the White Paper "Financial Services in the United Kingdom" says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The implementation of the European Community Directives on official stock exchange listing has necessitated a further set of statutory rules governing this particular area."</p></blockquote>
The White Paper was published in January 1985 and the Bill was published in December 1985. Like many other matters referred to in the White Paper, and like all White Papers generally, they are open to subsequent representation. The Government's intentions could not have been clearer, nor could a more reasonable period have elapsed between their publication and the issue of the Bill for interested parties to have made representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the observations made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and so that there should be no misunderstanding of the matter, I point out that there were extensive consultations on the provisions. Every draft has been shown to the stock exchange. The stock exchange was reluctant to accept that this legislation would cover these matters. That reluctance inhibited consultations on the detail. That is why consultation on the detail has not taken place in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of my coming to the Committee and asking for time. I am perfectly prepared to proceed with the Committee's deliberations. I am entirely happy to respond to any of the amendments on the amendment paper and I urge, Sir Michael, that we now make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one important distinction between this part of the White Paper and the rest of it. Most of the White Paper represented proposals for a vast extension of regulation into areas that were not previously regulated. Chapter 13 "Public issues and takeovers" deals with a section where the existing procedure was perfectly acceptable to everyone concerned, including the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that one argument that my hon. and learned Friend will use is that all he is doing is bringing into this Bill legislation or EEC requirements that already exist. This is not a huge extension like the other clauses. That is an important distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had no difficulty in hearing the views of the stock exchange about this matter. Indeed, I have heard them more clearly on this issue than on many others. As my hon. and learned Friend has said, surely it is to proceed and discuss the amendments. I am not happy about their being deferred to the Report stage. We want to discuss them in Committee, and those of us who are briefed to discuss them will support the amendments on the amendment paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spent half an hour or so debating more general questions. As we are now only 35 minutes from the end of our sitting the Minister may have substantially achieved one of his objectives. However, the course of the debate has exacted a certain price for that small gain. It has been revealed that for whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
reason—the stock exchange is not here to defend itself—the Committee is compelled to examine these important provisions while the competent authority is clearly still at odds with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that such a conflict should arise at this stage in our proceedings on a Bill which was published three months ago. We are now debating clause 117, yet we must debate the issues involved under the handicap of knowing that consultations with the stock exchange have yet to proceed and to be completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the hon. Gentleman to clause 131.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a typically opaque remark. I am well aware of clause 131, of the stock exchange's grave objections to it, which I do not share, and of the fact that clause 131 opens up the possibility of the stock exchange not being the competent authority. That is all true, but we know that in practice the stock exchange is and will be the competent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to labour the point, but I repeat that it is extraordinary that the Committee should find itself in this dilemma and that it should debate matters over which the competent authority and the Government cannot agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of progress I should normally seek to bring the debate to a close, but, as we have heard no substantive reply from the Minister on the amendments, will he remedy the omission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would greatly extend the potential scope of a clause which is designed to do no more than to retain flexibility to exercise our option under article 2 of the EC admission directive 79/279/EEC to bring open-ended collective investment undertakings within its scope, and hence within the scope of part IV. At present we have exercised that option the other way, because clause 77 confers power to impose requirements on the contents of particulars issued in relation to collective investment schemes which are promoted to the public, but it is prudent to retain the possibility to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide a means of unilaterally extending the scope of the directives to, potentially, any investment covered by schedule 1. It could be used to remove completely the stock exchange's autonomy over investments outside the scope of the directives. Whether such investments should be admitted to official listing and on what terms are matters for the stock exchange and not the Government to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill confers sufficient powers—for example, through rules made under clause 45(2)(e)—to regulate the form and content of advertisements relating to investments not covered by part IV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content with the Minister's reply and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that following the discussion at our previous sitting when the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and I withdrew our amendments after a considerable assurance from the Minister, today's 
	<i>Financial Times</i> carries an article that suggests that MIBOC may wish to ignore completely the representations that the Committee has made and that the Minister will make. The 
	<i>Financial Times</i> states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the industry is not too worried about the developments because Miboc has several life assurance practitioners on its committee and a former chairman of the Life Offices' Association as consultant."</p></blockquote>
It is disgraceful if that is so, and I hope that, when the Minister meets the chairman of MIBOC—as I understand it, that will be this afternoon—he will raise the issue with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me, but the Minister has taken the point on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I told the Committee on Tuesday that I had made clear to the chairman of MIBOC the Committee's anxieties. I am satisfied that MIBOC understands those anxieties, in a serious and genuine spirit, and will pursue the matters on which I gave assurances on Tuesday, in an attempt to put forward proposals that will meet those anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael Opposition Members are confident that the Minister will carry out his undertaking to the Committee, and it would be wrong to impugn the good faith in which he gave that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I accept the comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary, and perhaps he will remind the chairman of MIBOC that the powers will not be delegated unless we are satisfied that they will be used properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to give a ruling to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Smith), but his is not here, so I shall not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 90, line 31, leave out from "Act" to end of line 33 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be exercised by any committee, sub-committee, officer or servant of the authority except that listing rules—

	<ol>

	<li>shall be made only by the authority itself or by a committee or sub-committee of the authority; and</li>

	<li>if made by a committee or sub-committee, shall cease to have effect at the end of the period of twenty-eight days beginning with the day on which they are made (but without prejudice to anything done under them) unless before the end of that period they are confirmed by the authority.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Under clause 117(8), the general freedom of the council of the stock exchange to delegate functions to the competent authority does not extend to the power to make listing rules. It would be objectionable in principle if the power to make statutory rules on listing could be delegated, instead of being exercised by the full council, as the council is appointed as the competent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the stock exchange has made representations and in some cases—for example, in some current contested takeovers—it is necessary to make rules more quickly than a full council can be convened. The amendment provides, therefore, a procedure analogous to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
standard parliamentary procedure for important and urgent statutory instruments. A committee of sub-committee will be able to make rules with immediate effect, provided that those rules are ratified by the full council within 28 days. If they are not ratified, that will not affect their validity, or the validity of anything done under them in the intervening period. The amendment will enable the stock exchange to respond quickly and flexibly to curb abuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I raise one point, which I hope is in order, as it does not relate directly to the amendment? As the amendment concerns the power of subsidiary bodies under the council to institute rule changes, perhaps my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary will confirm that, following the change instituted in respect of SIB's ability to change rules, SIB will be able, in some circumstances, to change the rules of the stock exchange as an SRO, and that those rules include the rules regarding listing. As my hon. and learned Friend is considering how SIB's rule-changing power can be implemented efficaciously, possibly by consultation, is he satisfied that, if rules on listing are required to be made suddenly, and the stock exchange is unwilling to change its rules as SIB considers necessary, the board will be able to impose such a change within a short period of time, and that the consultation process will not drag on at such length that that will be impossible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the rule-making power in this context, the stock exchange is acting as a statutory listing authority and not as an SRO. That makes a fundamental difference to the role of the designated agency. The Government accepted in principle an amendment to clause 12 to give the designated agency a rule-changing power over SROs. That principle would not apply to these rules because they are not made by the stock exchange in its capacity as an SRO, so the further issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) do not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just come back on that? The point may be well understood by other members of the Committee, but I wish to probe it a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB is now statutorily part of the Bill, and is charged with responsibility for overseeing and supervising the self-regulatory structure of the investment markets and with protecting investors generally. Is my hon. and learned Friend happy that, as I understand his reply, SIB is not empowered to impose rule changes and that it has no locus standi in listing generally, because this part of the Bill must be seen as quite separate from the other provisions? Perhaps we should return to the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in the Bill we have sought to promulgate the general concepts of investor protection and of the freedom and fairness with which people can come to our markets, knowing that they will be dealt with responsibly and honestly. Is it right that such people should be excluded? It seems somewhat arbitrary that some of the rules and responsibilities of the stock exchange council should, like those of other SROs, be within the remit of the SIB, but that here they should be without that remit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the general direction of what the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) said. His
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
earlier arguments on the general question whether parts IV and V ought to be in the Bill, which were strongly endorsed by the Minister, point to the fact that the provisions are an essential and integral part of providing investor protection. If there is to be an SIB with a statutory place in the Bill for some part of that investor protection structure, it is odd that the SIB should have no part to play here or on takeovers, insider dealing and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister recognise that the process of reason that he endorses takes him to the objective which, I believe, he, his hon. Friend and I share?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a difference. The designated agency will be responsible for regulating and supervising the carrying out of investment business. In that context, it is appropriate that it should have powers in relation to SROs, which will themselves regulate the conduct of investment business within the sectors of the market for which they are responsible. Accordingly, the designated agency should have various powers in relation to those bodies, such as we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the stock exchange is expected to be one of those SROs those powers of the designated agency would apply to the stock exchange as an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are discussing different functions of the stock exchange acting as a statutory listing authority and putting into effect detailed statutory requirements relating to listing, which derive their origin from the European Community directive, but which will be adapted and incorporated in the Bill. They will appear in considerable detail in the statute. I suggest that that distinction makes it unnecessary to give the designated agency any role here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister is on strong ground. He is correct in saying that the stock exchange's power to make rules on listing requirements is of a different order from the power to make rules in its role as a self-regulating organisation. The Minister argues that listing particulars, prospectuses, insider dealing and takeovers are all part of the process of investor protection. However, my point—which I accept does not arise specifically under the amendment—is that if the SIB is to provide investor protection, it is odd to exclude it from that part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the basis for the distinction. The example used by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) is perhaps the best example of why it would not be appropriate to give the designated agency such a role. The rules will be statutory rules closely circumscribed by the directive. My hon. Friend asked whether the designated agency's rule-changing power in relation to SROs would apply. It would not be appropriate to give a rule-changing power where the rules in question were statutory rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Government amendment no. 294.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (9) gives immunity for anything done or not done in good faith. Regulation 8(1) of the listing regulations gives the council of the stock exchange and its members, officers or servants immunity from civil damages for anything done or omitted to be done as competent authority unless the act or omission was in bad faith. The stock exchange has made representations that there is a subtle shift in the burden of proof between regulation 8(1) and subsection (9). Amendments Nos. 292, 293 and 294 put beyond doubt that the burden of proof is on the plantiff. Amendments Nos. 277 and 278, which follow regulation 8(1), clearly have the same intention, but do not bring out the point expressly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is certainly no intention to weaken the stock exchange's position as the competent authority, and the Government amendments put that beyond doubt. Therefore, I hope that my hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) (Save as provided in section 124) no person shall be liable in damages by reason only of non-compliance with or contravention of any provision of this Part of this Act (or of the listing rules) and no transaction shall be void or voidable by reason only of the fact that it was entered into in contravention of, or not in conformity with, any such provision'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to reinstate a provision in the Stock Exchange (Listings) Regulations 1984. Until now the main sanction against non-compliance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
with the listing rules has been a refusal to list, suspension, or withdrawal of listing by the competent authority. I do not know why that policy needs to be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 124 provides for the compensation of anyone who acquires securities on the basis of misleading or untrue statement in listing particulars. The introduction of further liabilities on issuers may have a detrimental effect on London as a financial centre, as issuers may be tempted to seek a listing in other markets that do not impose similar liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The liabilities that the clause would impose do not exist now; they are specifically excluded under the Stock Exchange (Listings) Regulatoins 1984. No evidence has been produced to suggest that the introduction of sanctions over and above those that are available at present and those that are in clause 124 would protect investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the general sentiments that my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) has expressed. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply, in view of the importance of ensuring that people are not dissuaded from coming to our markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment appears to have two aims. First, it seeks to put beyond doubt the fact that there will be no civil liability for breaches of listing rules or the provisions of part IV. Second, it provides that no transaction shall be void or voidable because of such breaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot subscribe to the first aim in relation to listing particulars. It may be more convenient to deal with that later when we debate amendments to clause 124, which deals with issuers' liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can be more encouraging about the second aim and assure my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) that I intend to table a Government amendment to ensure that transactions will not be void solely for breaches of the conditions for listing and to make it clear that decisions to admit securities to listing may not be challenged after the event. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the latter part of my hon. and learned Friend's remarks. In the light of that, I am persuaded reluctantly not to press the amendment, although the other point is not covered. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask a question about subsection (9), which deals with liability to damages, and immunity. It relates to part IV in so far as the part places statatutory responsibilities for listing on the stock exchange. I can understand that the Minister wants to give immunity to the stock exchange in that sense, but I cannot understand why he differentiates between an SRO carrying out its responsibilities in that area and SROs that may not have a responsibility of the same nature, but which are equally liable to be sued for damages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distinction between the stock exchange and the activities of a self-regulating organisation is identical to the distinction that I made earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
between the designated agency and the self-regulating organisations. The stock exchange is given immunity from liability in this area because it is carrying out statutory functions. In the same way, the designed agency will be carrying out statutory functions and is given a similar immunity. Self-regulating organisations are not carrying out statutory functions; they derive their authority essentially from the contractual relationship that exists between their members. That puts the matter on an entirely different basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a fundamental distinction—it is not simply a legalistic or hair-splitting one. Any immunity from the normal processes of the law and the normal remedies that would be available to the citizen needs to be most carefully considered and limited to carefully defined circumstances. It is reasonable for a distinction to be made on the basis of whether the body concerned is exercising statutory powers and that is why immunity is limited in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel obliged to comment on what the Minister has said, because I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) had a strong point. The Minister was no doubt anticipating the rejoinders that he may receive in trying to acquit himself of the charge of taking refuge in a legalistic or hair-splitting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, one can see that there is a distinction involved between statutory powers and voluntary agreements. Nevertheless, for precisely the reason that the Minister feels it necessary to confer an immunity on the stock exchange when it exercises those powers, he ought to give immunity to the SROs. He should do that not because they are on the same legal footing—I accept that they are not—but because they are an essential part of the structure provided by the Bill: If no body was willing to undertake the function of the SROs, a gaping hole would be left in that structure. The Minister is presuming on the good will, good faith and the willingness of the SROs to undertake self-regulation as part of the statutory arrangement, but is failing to provide them with the immunity which, by virtue of their willingness to undertake that role, they could expect. Simply to say, "Ah yes, but the SROs are voluntary bodies and not statutory bodies," is to fly in the face of the structure that the Minister intends to create under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) makes the point in that way. I am sure that he has not overlooked the fact that the immunity that is given to the stock exchange in relation to its functions extends to immunity from suit by a third party. It has never been suggested that a self-regulating organisation should be given immunity from suit by an investor. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has changed his view on that, but if it is not suggested that that be given, the parallel that he seeks to draw between self-regulating organisations and the stock exchange in its capacity as listing authority immediately disappears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always understood the hon. Gentleman to accept that a third party—an investor—should have the right to sue a self-regulating organisation. If his anxiety is restricted to the ability of a member of an SRO to bring actions against that organisation, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
remedy is available for a self-regulating organisation and its members to include in their contractual relationship a stipulation that the SRO should not be liable to suit by its members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the discussion, but I believe that the Minister is being disingenuous in trying to point to the scope of any immunity—that is not the point. The Minister attempted to explain the distinction in the Bill between the stock exchange and other—voluntary—bodies on precisely that basis. It was that basis which I was attacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the point that the Minister made about the nature of the immunity for which we are arguing, the case is even stronger for SROs than it is for the stock exchange. The immunity that we want for self-regulating organisations goes even more directly to the heart of their capacity to fulfil the obligations that the Bill, by its clear and direct implication, will place on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
I accept that there is a distinction in the scope of the immunity, but because the immunity for which we are arguing is immunity against litigation at the suit of members of organisations that are to be regulated, it becomes even more central to the proper performance of their functions by the self-regulating organisations. The Minister is on a weak point in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
