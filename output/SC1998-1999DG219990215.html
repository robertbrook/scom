	<div class='legislation'>Draft Development Commission (Transfer of Functions and Miscellaneous Provisions Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Development Commission (Transfer of Functions and Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The order is made under sections 35 and 37 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. The purpose of the order is to achieve four things: to create the new Countryside Agency by renaming the Countryside Commission the Countryside Agency; to transfer the Rural Development Commission functions to the Countryside Agency; to provide for appropriate RDC property, rights and liabilities to be transferred to the Countryside Agency; and to enable the Countryside Agency and the Urban Regeneration Agency, known as English Partnerships, to provide certain specialised services in support of the Regional Development Agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is part of the process of implementing certain provisions of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. In particular, it will put into effect the decision to create the Countryside Agency from the merger of the Countryside Commission with the parts of the Rural Development Commission that are not being transferred to the Regional Development Agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been pursuing their objectives to delegate decision making to the English regions, as hon. Members will be well aware. Regional Development Agencies, established under the 1998 Act, will advance the development of a more strategic approach to regional issues, including regeneration. In considering the roles and responsibilities of the RDAs, it was decided that rural regeneration should be an integral part to be included within the RDA's remit. It was, therefore, concluded that the rural regeneration work currently performed by the regional teams in the Rural Development Commission should transfer to RDAs on 1 April 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some public concern—I think it is misplaced—that this approach might militate against rural areas. Therefore, to ensure that rural issues are given due weight, RDAs are also being given a specific remit to serve their rural areas, and at least one member of each RDA board outside London has rural experience. RDAs are also being given guidance on rural policy matters. Of course, my Department has consulted rural interests on its content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The decision to transfer rural regeneration work from the RDC to the RDAs gave consideration of the future of other statutory agencies added impetus. As part of the Government's comprehensive spending review, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food conducted a joint review of countryside and rural policy. The review considered a range of institutional options, and stated that there was considerable common ground between the work of the RDC and the Countryside Commission. Bringing the two agencies together will consolidate their work and create a powerful new champion for rural England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, during and following the review, the Government emphasised the need for a more integrated approach to policy making. Many rural issues can obviously benefit from being considered in the round. The Rural Development Commission and the Countryside Commission have, for many years, been working closely together in several areas, for example, on joint experimental projects to promote green tourism. It was therefore thought that a merger could build on that relationship and establish a more integrated approach. Considering social, economic and environmental needs of the countryside together should help our overarching aim of sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, the merger was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 March 1998 during the passage of the Regional Development Agencies Bill. The combined experience and expertise of the Countryside Commission and Rural Development Commission in the new agency—under the order, it will be named the Countryside Agency— will provide a national source of research and advice about countryside and rural issues. It will cover social, economic and environmental matters, and it will promote and help others to develop policies and programmes to overcome rural disadvantage. That will be backed up by a continued programme of innovative projects on the ground, through pilot and demonstration schemes. The Countryside Agency will provide advice direct to Government, and will also be a source of advice to the RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order enables schemes to be drawn up for the transfer of staff and assets from the RDC to the Countryside Commission and to English Partnerships. In parallel, the provisions of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 include making schemes to transfer staff and assets from English Partnerships and the RDC to the RDAs or other public bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also enables English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission, during its final months, to provide services to the RDAs. In particular, those services cover information technology support for regeneration programmes. That will ensure that the expertise and systems of English Partnerships and the RDC are available to the RDAs in the early days to enable them to become established quickly and seamlessly, so that they are not distracted by being involved in operational issues. This
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
measure is without prejudice to the wishes of the RDAs to consider their long-term strategies and to establish independent systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1 April 1999, the RDC's regional regeneration activities, with the relevant staff, programmes, rights, assets and liabilities, will transfer to the RDAs. I remind the Committee that the RDC's statutory functions are to keep under review and advise the Secretary of State on all matters relating to the economic and social development of rural areas in England, and to carry out or assist others to carry out measures likely to further such development. Those statutory functions will transfer to the Countryside Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, that covers the RDC's countrywide activity and its valuable research and advisory roles. The RDC's staff, programmes, property, rights and liabilities to match those activities will also transfer. Only a small residue of the RDC, limited to winding up its affairs, will be left, with a small number of commissioners. There will be a few members of staff, headed by an accounting officer, to finalise the accounts and settle any outstanding personnel and establishment work. We intend the final wind-up to take place by the end of September, for which another affirmative resolution order will need to be made under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. The staff concerned have elected to stay on for that process, and will then either retire or be made redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of the staff are important and we must bear them closely in mind. The staff transferring to all the new agencies will do so on their existing terms and conditions, with no detriment to any of their employment rights and with continuity of employment. As is usual in such cases, staff will be offered broadly comparable pension provision; in this case, through membership of the principal civil service pension scheme, which has identical provisions to that operated by the RDC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am coming to the end of my comments, but if the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) wishes to intervene, I am happy to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, because he is dealing with an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification. Does the Minister expect there to be any compulsory or voluntary redundancies as a result of those actions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not expecting there to be compulsory redundancies other than those few RDC members who have stayed on for the winding-up process, many of whom are located in Salisbury. They will either retire or be made redundant, but the number is small and we are doing our best to provide job opportunities for all staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will there be any voluntary redundancies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Voluntary redundancies are a different matter. If people decide, as a result of the upheaval or because they are unwilling or unable to change their residence, that they would prefer to leave
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
and find another job, that is a matter for them. I do not know the extent to which that might be the case, but I think that the number involved will be small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff transfers have been worked out through a series of steps. The first identified the work programmes; the second the posts that go with them; and the third drew up plans to transfer them to several different agencies—either the Countryside Agency, the eight RDAs or English Partnerships—if they were not remaining to wind-up the RDC. That involved regular and detailed discussions with the agencies and the staff themselves. Once that was achieved, a staff preference exercise was held to enable the selection of staff for each agency on a fair and competitive basis. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is paying attention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman can do two things at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions were consulted throughout. That was especially important because we expected some rationalisation of work and structural changes, with the likelihood of staff surpluses arising in some areas of work and shortages elsewhere. Plans to overcome that potential mismatch included seeking volunteers for different work as well as for redundancy. A number of staff have opted to take on new responsibilities within the agencies and others have volunteered to take redundancy, but most of the posts will be filled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer schemes cover office accommodation and will transfer existing freeholds or leaseholds. Following detailed discussions and negotiation, the Countryside Agency and the RDAs will between them inherit the RDC offices, some of which will be shared and some of which will become surplus to requirements. In time, we expect the agencies to rationalise their accommodation, particularly because some groups of staff will be divided between several locations. But there will be a good geographical spread in the offices of the Countryside Agency and the RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Countryside Agency will have a new chairman and some new members. Other members will be drawn from the existing boards of the RDC and the Countryside Commission to provide continuity and valuable experience. The chairman will be supported by the current chief executive of the Countryside Commission, and decisions on the full board composition will be taken soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to say a word on budgets and programmes. As the RDC's activities are being divided between the Countryside Agency and the RDAs, it follows that the equivalent budgets will also be sub-divided. The RDC's budget for 1999–2000 is around £43 million, about £25 million of which is for rural regeneration, which will transfer to the RDAs. The balance of £18 million from the RDC's budget will go to the Countryside Agency, including more than £4 million for the rural transport partnership to support innovative projects in rural areas and to complement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the rural transport development fund, both of which are run by the RDC. The new agency will also inherit £24 million from the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comprehensive spending review highlighted the case for greater expenditure to help overcome rural deprivation; to provide for access and recreation; and to cover landscape protection. In addition to inheriting funds from the RDC and the Countryside Commission—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brake 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Countryside Commission will inherit £24 million. Is that the total Countryside Commission budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Countryside Commission budget includes that £24 million. I do not know whether that is its total budget. I shall ensure that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) has an answer before the end of the debate. The budget certainly includes most of the £24 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comprehensive spending review was designed to achieve three additional purposes. Therefore, as well as inheriting funds from the RDC and the Countryside Commission, the Countryside Agency will receive another £6 million to enable it to take forward the three initiatives that I have mentioned. Additional funding will be provided to cover the costs incurred by the agency in the merger. The detailed allocation of funds will be agreed in the agency's first-year operating plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This funding will give the agency an effective start— by strengthening its work of promoting and conserving the natural landscape, by supporting rural communities and by promoting access to and enjoyment of the countryside. It will also provide for pilot projects. Part of the additional funds will be used for necessary restructuring costs and to ensure that the RDC is efficiently wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can now give the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington the assurance that he sought: the £24 million is the total Countryside Commission budget, so the whole budget will now go to the Countryside Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate, because the order goes to the heart of policy on rural England and the protection and development of our countryside. In the last 18 months or so we have seen the simultaneous and spontaneous creation of organisations such as Save Our Countryside, because people in the country see a threat to their traditional way of life. They feel threatened by the problems of unemployment and redundancies, and by the contraction of too many villages into dormitory villages, instead of being living entities with a thriving local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
As the Minister outlined, the order not only changes the name of the Countryside Commission to the Countryside Agency, but merges the Countryside Commission and the Development Commission under the umbrella of the new agency from 1 April. Its remit is clearly set out in the agency's aims and priorities. In addition, the role of the Regional Development Agencies is crucial to the Government's plans, because the initial decision that set in train the events leading to the establishment of this body was the setting up of the RDAs under the 1998 legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to remind the Minister of Lord Shuttleworth's comments in October 1997 prior to the legislation setting up the RDAs. In a press release issued by the Rural Development Commission he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Commissioners are extremely concerned that such a move could put at risk the existence of the Commission, which over many decades has effectively promoted jobs and services in rural England. We do not believe that the benefits which flow from our exclusive focus on rural affairs and depth of expertise could be replicated by eight regional development agencies. Rural England would lose a national champion and a proven means of channelling Government resources to rural areas."</p></blockquote>
To be fair to the Minister, I suspect that it was as a result of that powerful and robust criticism, and criticism expressed in other areas, that the Government were prepared to have a modest rethink. The result is presumably the merger outlined in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Countryside Commission deals with the welfare of the countryside and the RDC with the welfare of the community, does the Minister believe that these combined roles will lead to a coherent, integrated and compatible modus operandi? If his answer is yes, as I suspect it will be, will he explain to the Committee how that will be achieved? As the Minister knows, economic regeneration functions will be transferred to the RDAs. How will that work in practice? Will not the Countryside Agency's agenda inevitably lead to conflicts of interest with the RDAs? Should they arise, how will they be resolved? Does the Minister agree that, potentially, the RDAs will retain the upper hand in any disputes and will be able to steamroller the Countryside Agency's objections, to the detriment of rural life and interests? Will the Minister deal with those concerns?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Minister's views on the mechanics of the order, and why are the Government apparently having terrible difficulty setting it up? The order will be implemented on 1 April, yet it is unnumbered and gives no date of creation or implementation. In many ways, we are being asked to sign a blank cheque. I am perplexed that, at this late stage, the order should contain so many gaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Countryside Agency will be established in approximately six weeks' time, why has a chairman yet to be appointed? The Minister said that he hoped that a chairman and board members would be appointed shortly, but why are they not in place now? As I am sure he will agree, firm, decisive leadership is crucial in the run-up to creating new organisations, particularly when a merger is involved.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Why has no chairman been appointed to smooth over and facilitate the marriage and merger of the two bodies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much press speculation about the candidates for the job of chairman. If certain reports are to be believed, they include someone who works in this building, although not as a Member of this House or of the other place. Has not the appointment of such an important position been left rather late in the day? Will not that undermine the early days of the Countryside Agency? At such a critical time, any new body needs strong and visionary leadership to cope with tensions and teething problems, and to ensure smooth and efficient development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister categorically assure the Committee that the new chairman, or chairwoman, will not be a political appointment—a Labour party lackey or placeman—but someone with established managerial flair and skills? Why has the appointment of the agency's other board members also been left so late in the day? The Minister said that some existing Members would be retained, and we accept the importance and wisdom of continuity of membership. However, why have not at least some new members been appointed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have known for months that the agency would be established on 1 April, but nothing has happened. Are the Government having internal problems finding candidates? Is there internal arguing about people or are certain quarters concerned that the Government are thinking of appointing placemen who will not meet with the approval of those with a keen interest in the subject? I invite the Minister to take the Committee into his confidence and explain what has been going on behind the scenes and why the decision has taken so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wanting to ruin the Minister's career or reputation, I must say that he is a genuinely decent man—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I say that with all sincerity. It is unfair that some Labour Members should query the credentials that he has built up, with some justification, over the past 20 months. The Government show a tendency to brush aside criticisms and attempts to hold them to account, but I hope that, for once, the Minister will come clean and pleasantly surprise us all by answering the questions that are being asked—as I happen to know from conversations with Labour Members—on both sides of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.56 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After being wrongfooted by the hon. Gentleman's very complimentary conclusion, I shall try to set his mind at rest on the issues that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the fact that several bodies had been created, and he mentioned Save our Countryside. The quality of life in many of our villages has undoubtedly worsened. I remind him that the Government inherited that problem. I shall not make a partisan presentation—he did not do so either—but 70 per cent, of rural parishes have no general store, 43 per cent, have no post office, 49 per cent, have no school, 75 per cent, have no daily bus service, 83 per cent, have no general practitioner based
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
in the parish and 99 per cent, have no job centre. That situation did not arise after May 1997. I hope that Labour and Opposition Members agree that there is an enormous need to focus on the regeneration of our villages and of the rural way of life. When we produce our rural White Paper later this year, we shall make it clear that that problem, which we inherited, is at the centre of our concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the most recent date of the statistics that the Minister cited? If they apply after 2 May 1997, does he have similar figures for the period up to 2 May 1997?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The RDC published its 1997 survey of rural services in February—the year is almost certainly 1998, although it could be 1999. I do not have subsequent figures, but I suspect that they have changed little in either direction. That is the whole thrust of our countryside policy, and a major role for the RDA has been—and a major role for the Countryside Agency will be—to impact on those figures. The current situation is unacceptable, and major investment and many innovative projects are needed if we are going to change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to Lord Shuttleworth, whom I met on several occasions and who was committed to his work. I pay unstinting tribute to the RDC and to Lord Shuttleworth's leadership. The RDC performed a valuable role, and it is no reflection on that role that it is being merged with the Countryside Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the comprehensive spending review, the joint review of countryside policy by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries, and Food examined the institutions and the scope for efficiency savings. It considered the possibility of creating a single agency out of any permutation of the RDC, the Countryside Commission, English Nature and the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, which is supervised by MAFF. The review concluded that considerable common ground existed between the RDC and the Countryside Commission, and that combining them—which I am sure was the right decision—could create a powerful new champion for rural England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I try to avoid using the cliché "joined-up government", but it describes a process that is proper and necessary. The RDC and the Countryside Commission have worked together for many years—on joint experimental projects, for example—and there was a view, which I am sure was right, that they would work better together if they were integrated. That is the reason for the merger. I am sure that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford would agree that, given the move towards regional government and RDAs, it is appropriate for rural regeneration matters to be dealt with by the RDAs. Those bodies can use their organisational and financial muscle in a way that will promote rural areas and increase investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford looks somewhat sceptical on that point. First, it should be made clear that a strict remit for the strategy for rural areas will be introduced and monitored.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Secondly, funding will be protected to ensure that existing funding—and preferably more of it—goes to rural areas. Thirdly, at least one member of the RDA board—and, in some cases, two or three—will be a person with expertise and experience in rural matters. Those are reasonable grounds for expecting the RDAs to be committed—as the Government intend—to rural areas. I pay an unqualified tribute to the RDC, but we believe that the merger will improve, extend and deepen the work that it started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware of the disquiet about the ability of RDAs to represent rural areas. The East Midlands RDA, which has a statutory requirement for one representative of a rural area to be on the board, has no representation for Lincolnshire or Northamptonshire. Given the geographical composition of that area, will not the needs of such rural counties be overlooked? One member out of 12 on the board does not create confidence that proper account will be taken of rural interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose the answer is that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I mentioned the requirement to have one member of the board representing a rural area, which I agree is rather minimalist, but in most cases the requirement will be for more than one such member. Where there are representatives of other interests—and those interests are the key factors in the appointment—such representatives may also have considerable experience of rural areas. Therefore, the number of members who represent rural areas may not be confined to one, two or three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nice for every county, area and district to be represented, but if there are only 12 people on the board the opportunities are limited. A full spread of representation is impossible without having an unwieldy and ineffective body. I believe that 12 members is approximately the right number. I am anxious, however, that the interests of rural areas should be addressed: the Government are aware that we will be held to account on that matter. We shall monitor extremely carefully the resources and the personnel commitment given to rural areas to deal with the enormous deficiencies that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford asked whether I believed that the combined role would lead to coherent programmes to deal with countryside policy. As he would expect, my answer is yes. Otherwise, we would not have done that. Why do I believe that? For the reasons that I have already given. The RDC and the Countryside Commission were put together because, for the past decade, there has been substantial overlap, with the two organisations being engaged in very similar activities. It is not as if we are forcing together very different bodies. There is already a natural synergy, which, we believe, the order will promote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
With regard to the programmes being transferred to RDAs, the hon. member for West Chelmsford asked whether there would be a conflict of interest between the Countryside Agency and the RDAs. Again, it is our strong concern that there should be no conflict of interest, and that the two bodies should have a harmonious working relationship. Membership may overlap in some cases, but the two bodies have specific remits: the Countryside Agency's remit is different to that of the RDAs. The RDAs are primarily concerned with economic development—although we are anxious that social and environmental sustainable development is written into their brief—whereas the Countryside Agency's remit goes wider than economic development. The agency will give the Government advice on wider rural matters, and the Government will take its advice into account in their advice to RDAs. I see no reason why the two organisations should not work well together.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand what the Minister is saying, but what happens if—this may never happen but the question needs to be asked—there is conflict and, on specific issues and in certain parts of the country, the agency and the RDAs do not work together? Who will be the final arbiter? Who will knock heads together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will knock heads together if the two bodies do not work together or if there are areas of conflict in their policies. That is something for the Government to deal with. We must provide for a role that is consistent and complementary. It is the Government's intention that the two bodies should meet regularly and take account
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
of each other's role and programmes. My colleagues at MAFF and I shall be in close contact both with the RDAs and the Countryside Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford asked whether the RDAs would be able to steamroller their way through, and whether they will have the greater power. They will certainly have the greater organisational and financial muscle because their budgets will be much larger. But again, we are talking about remit and roles. We are not saying that they will have the same role, and that those who have the most money will have the most impact, because the bodies will have complementary and consistent roles. We shall seek to ensure that neither organisation dominates, but that they each contribute to the overall objective of a better countryside policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked when the order would come into force. I understand that article 1 will take effect on the day after the debate, so there will be no delay—quite the reverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek some technical information. Article 1 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Order … shall come into force on the day after the day on which it is made."</p></blockquote>
Is that why the Order is blank at the top, where it says "Made … 1999"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the appointment of a chairman. He will be delighted to know that I agree with him that it has taken a long time. Many people have been interviewed, and we are extremely concerned to appoint the right person. There has been considerable debate about the matter. The criteria speak for themselves. The right person should have communication skills and, ideally, a measure of vision and a perspective—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Managerial ability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am allowed to complete my comments, and the hon. Gentleman is polite enough to listen, he may find his questions answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vision of the countryside and a commitment to and enthusiasm for it are important, as are communication skills and the managerial capability to run an organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaps to his feet to say that he will judge our due appointee on how far the person has in equal measure all those important characteristics, he should realise that individuals vary considerably—they have different strengths. We have to make a balanced judgment, and we shall appoint the chairman very soon. That is as far as I can go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tease the Minister for a little more information? He mentioned three basic criteria: first, communication skills, secondly—almost an afterthought as a result of sedentary prompting—managerial ability, and thirdly, ability to deal with the press. He will know as well as anyone on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Committee who has shown a close interest in the subject that the press are speculating that one of their own number from this building is being considered for the chairmanship. Of course that person has good communication skills, because that is her job, and she knows how to handle the press, even from the other side. Is that person in the running or is press speculation a load of rubbish, or has her application been overtaken by other applications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen's comments were made with his tongue in his cheek. Indeed, there is a big smile on his face. It is a good try, but he knows that the Government will not talk about any candidates until we make an appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it a bit of a cheek to be told by the Tory spokesman that we might be appointing placemen or placewomen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the hon. Gentleman why. For 18 years we suffered helplessly in opposition as we watched the Tory Government appoint placepeople to the enormous number quangos that they set up. The known political affiliations of most of the chairmen or board members of those quangos were overwhelmingly Tory. We have been a great deal more balanced in our appointments. I do not think that anyone could truthfully say that after 18 years in the wilderness, the Labour party has come in and put its own people into those positions. It has not; in many cases, the Government have appointed people of a Tory disposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that last point, I know to what the Minister is referring. It is wonderful to put two or three well-known Tories on boards and use them as the shining example of Labour's reasonableness. However, of the 103 individuals appointed to the eight Regional Development Agencies, 32 are Labour placemen, eight claim to have connections with the Liberal Democrats and six with the Conservatives. One in three are Labour placemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a point of fact—the Minister may want to have a word with his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health about this—research on health authorities and trusts found that the number of political appointments ran at about 8 per cent. for the Conservatives, 6 per cent. for Labour and 3 per cent. for the Liberal Democrats, which does not coincide with the Minister's claim, oft-repeated by his colleagues, that we stuffed all the bodies with Tories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor does it accord with the research that I can recall on NHS trust appointments and many other quango appointments. However, I am sure, Mr. Hood, that you will tell us that we must keep to the order, and we are straying a little away from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall ensure that the best person for the job is appointed, without regard to political ideology or membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new body will not be denuded of board members, because many will be transferred from the Countryside Commission and the RDC. We are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
holding interviews for the other board members this month. Those interviews were postponed from last year pending the appointment of the chair. I accept that that has taken longer than we expected, but we intend to make an appointment shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say when? It will save me having to speak again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the inducement, it is irresistible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain, because I do not follow the logic of it, why the Government must postpone the appointment of new board members simply because they have not chosen a chairman or chairwoman? As the Minister rightly said and I acknowledged in my speech, some of the existing board members will remain to give continuity—which is sensible—so why does the appointment of board
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
members have to be held up until a chairman has been appointed? Why has it all slid so near to the date of 1 April?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why we have not proceeded with the appointment of other board members is simply that it is reasonable and sensible that the chairperson should have a say in those appointments. That is not to say that the chairperson will have a veto, but his or her opinion will certainly be taken into account. For that reason, we believed that it was right to have the chairperson in place first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the points that were raised, perhaps more fully than some of my hon. Friends would have wished, but I always try to be fair. I therefore commend the order to the Committee, and hope that it is acceptable to all parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
