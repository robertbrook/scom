	<i>Amendment moved</i> [
	<i>27th November</i>], In page 1, line 20, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that where an application under the scheme is made jointly by several persons and the Minister is satisfied such persons will carry out their trades or businesses by co-operating in a manner approved by the Minister such trades or businesses shall be deemed to be a single farm business for the purposes of the scheme.—[

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Diamond. Could a correction be made in line 41 of column 63 of the Official Report of our last proceedings; to strike out " non-industrial ", and to substitute " industrial "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been noted. Mr. Williams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday last, I was about to admit that the wording of the Amendment may not be the most perfect, but I am sure that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that we are here concerned not so much with the wording of the Amendment as with the principle involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1957 Bill, and in the White Paper, it was made clear that though the Government were not in favour of compulsory amalgamation, they would give every encouragement to either co-operation or amalgamation of smaller units that could take advantage of any grant that might be available. That statement has been repeated many times over, and I think that we say almost the same thing in " Prosper the Flowers ". We are not favourable to compulsory amalgamations, but we are willing and anxious to help where co-operation between or amalgamation of two or more farms takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
I believe that the Amendment provides the right opportunity for the right hon. Gentleman to give effect to the promises made by his predecessor and himself. When the Parliamentary Secretary was replying in the Second Reading debate I thought that he was making a concession to that point of view, but, on reading his speech, I discovered that it was not quite so good as all that. He then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Neighbouring small farmers who come under the scheme may very well find that they can share in purchasing any expensive item of equipment out of the farm business grant which they receive. If several of them got together and purchase one expensive machine they could work their own co-operative arrangement very well. I think that this would be an economical way of improving their farm business and of using some part of the grants that they will receive."</p></blockquote>
I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would make that clear in the new scheme, when it arrived, and he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall certainly take note of the right hon. Gentleman's point. I quite agree that it is important, and I am glad to be able to give that piece of information."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1958; Vol. 594, c. 148–9.]</p></blockquote>
So far, so good. Unfortunately, it does not go far enough, because the Committee will remember the words that I have just quoted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… small farmers who come under the scheme …"</p></blockquote>
We have already had turned down two Amendments that tended to reduce to the lowest common denominator the number of small farm schemes than can qualify. Presumably, the Parliamentary Secretary meant to exclude all holdings that failed to qualify either because of acreage or standard man-days, and, after last Thursday's vote, where the work is not a full-time occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many holdings that will exclude is very difficult for the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or myself to estimate. In a document sent to every hon. Member of the Committee, the National Farmers' Union states that as at June, 1957, there were 161,522 holdings of under 20 acres in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 18 of the White Paper the Minister gives some figures for the whole of the United Kingdom. He tells us that there are approximately 500,000 holdings of from one acre to the maximum acreage, but he goes on to say that a large number of those ½
	<i></i> million holdings are supposed to be part-time holdings. He estimates that the number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
full-time farm businesses in the United Kingdom to be slightly in excess of 300,000, of which more than two-thirds will fail to qualify for grant because of their size or because of their standard man-days; they are either too big to qualify or too efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then he says that most of the remainder, or something like 65,000, will qualify either for the small farms grant or for the supplementary scheme. In addition, it is suggested that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… about 25,000 former recipients of marginal assistance are expected to be eligible only for the Supplementary Scheme …"</p></blockquote>
That makes 90,000 in all. If, therefore, we take the slightly over two-thirds of the 300,000 that cannot qualify because of size or efficiency, plus the 90,000—the 65,000 and the 25,000—it leaves, approximately, 200,000 holdings within the United Kingdom that can qualify neither for the one thing nor the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my figures are correct, but for the benefit of all hon. Members I will repeat them. These are the Minister's figures, as shown in paragraph 18 of the White Paper. According to that, there are 500,000 holdings of all sizes. There are over 300,000 full-time businesses, of which two-thirds—approximately 210,000—will not qualify because they are too large or too efficient. There are 65,000 that may qualify for a small farm grant, and 25,000 that may qualify under the supplementary scheme. That leaves 200,000 holdings—most of them, I suppose very small; between one acre and 19 acres—in the United Kingdom that, for one reason or another, cannot qualify for any sort of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those 200,000 holdings there will, of course, be every size, kind and gradation between one acre and 20 acres. Some will be associated with the village pub. In the old days, the pub had an odd field or two associated with it because the sales of beer alone were never sufficient to maintain the landlord. Some smallholdings will be created by the making of new roads or by other forms of industrial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Others will be associated with forestry, and many of them will have no possible chance of ever becoming viable. That, we generally accept. On the other hand, out of the 200,000—particularly where two, three or more very small units have
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
joined, there must be many that could, if they co-operated and/or amalgamated, make themselves viable with the appropriate Government assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that there will be many of the smaller holdings in, say, Suffolk or Norfolk, where there are only one, two, three or four acres, that will qualify because of standard man-days—intensive horticulture; and others where they will qualify because of intensive livestock production with purchased feedingstuffs. But there will still be a large number of smaller units that could, by cooperation or amalgamation, ultimately make themselves viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only purpose of the Amendment is to persuade the Minister to make possible the co-operation or amalgamation of two or more units. We think that that sort of encouragement should be given. Indeed, it is an opportunity that the right hon. Gentleman just cannot afford to miss. It is very interesting to note that hon. Members opposite are utterly unconcerned about those 200,000 small units. They have not put down a solitary Amendment of a constructive character. Of the only two Amendments that have been voted on, they have voted against us—when we were trying to help them to help these small farmers. However, they are apparently not concerned about two-fifths of the total number of holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 30-odd years in the Chamber I have heard hon. Members who ought to be sitting opposite but who have mostly passed away, wax almost poetical when talking about farming being a way of life, and the enormous value of these small farmers to our social life. Today, hon. Members opposite have no time for the smaller units. By their actions they are demonstrating beyond any doubt that they are concerned only with the bigger farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is a very simple one. We say—or, at least, we mean—that if there are adjoining farms it is practical and sensible for them to amalgamate. The small farmers concerned are anxious to amalgamate and they should be given the encouragement and the opportunity to do so. Finally, they should be given the grant or grants that would make it worth their while to carry out such a scheme. We think that the Amendment is of some importance. We hope that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
Minister will see the wisdom of grasping this lifeline, without which he may live to see the departure of many of his hon. Friends behind him as a result of their having failed in their duty to the smaller farms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sidney Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) has tried—and, I think, has succeeded—to put before hon. Members opposite a practical method of expanding the scheme which the Minister has already formulated, and on which the Bill is based. He is anxious, as we all are on this side, that another rung shall be placed in the ladder by which the smaller men, with the aid given, can climb into a larger sphere of agricultural activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the very practical method of cooperation. If two or more small men co-operate, and thereby increase their stock and holdings to a size that would be considered within the scheme, we are placing before the Government the proposition that that enlarged unit should qualify for grants, which would enable the farmers concerned to make better use of their land and stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman or the Minister who earlier said he was going to support some of the Amendments on the Order Paper would find this one very close to his heart. He knows of many small farmers in his constituency and in the neighbouring areas, men worthy to play a part in British agriculture, who should be helped more rapidly up the ladder of progress. If they can learn to co-operate together right at the start, how much more successful are their business enterprises likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking around the country, this, it seems to me, is a mean of improving and expanding the scheme that has so far been announced which would be to the benefit of the country as a whole. More of the small farmers would be brought within the ambit of advice and assistance of the National Agricultural Advisory Service in the planning of their holdings together with their neighbours for better production, whether it be milk, eggs, pigs or any of the crops grown by smaller farmers, producing better quality and more of it and by doing that being assured of better marketing. It is a very practical
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
proposition which we are placing before hon. Members opposite as a means of achieving what they want, namely, to help the small farmers to work on a bigger scale and in a way that would be to the credit of the Government and of the industry at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will see the weaknesses and restrictions of the present scheme and the advantage which would come to him and to the Government by accepting the spirit of this Amendment, even if the words do not themselves convey the broader and the better purposes which we have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Archer Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) said that we on this side of the Committee were not supporting the idea of helping the small farmers with holdings of under 20 acres. I can, however, say that we on this side of the Committee have supported the Minister in bringing forward a scheme to help small farmers, whereas hon. Members opposite have never done anything to help them at all. We on this side are very keen to help the small farmer, and we look upon it as necessary not to take away a step in the ladder of advancement for the farm worker who is not able to start at all except on a somewhat small scale. We do not want to make it difficult for the Minister to carry out the scheme as laid down in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it clear last time we met that I had sympathy with this matter, and I hope that before the Bill passes from this Committee the Minister will bring forward some scheme, or, if it cannot be incorporated in the present Bill, that he will bring forward another Bill which will help the smaller farmers to become larger ones. I think, perhaps, that the Ministry is a little afraid that it will overburden its administration. Personally, I do not think it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is coming to the point of the Amendment. We are not yet on the Question, " That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir A. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with this idea, but I do not want to embarrass the Minister by suggesting that it should be brought into the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
by the amalgamation of those small farms. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to give sympathetic consideration to it either now or at some future time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Amendment offers a way of tackling a long-standing problem in British agriculture, that is, the undoubted difficulty of the smallness of many of our holdings at present. From time to time we bear arguments for the amalgamation of these smallholdings, and for a compulsory amalgamation. There is a considerable school of thought which advances that argument. The Amendment avoids the crude, and sometimes brutal, implications of such amalgamation and substitutes for it the very healthy principle of co-operation, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) clearly showed would achieve the object of retaining the value of the personal interest of these small farmers in their holdings and would also secure a valuable scheme of working two or more holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke about the Amendment to some or my farming friends in my constituency over the week-end, and I found that a great many of them deeply interested in the possibility of this kind of voluntary association under the aegis of the Bill which would enable them to put forward as a composite entity a scheme on which the N.A.A.S. could advise them and which would subsequently be considered for the various forms of assistance envisaged by the Bill. In particular, I discussed the rudiments of such an application with three small farmers who live quite close to me, two of whom hold nine acres each and the other eight and a half. Both as regards acreage and the test of standard man-days, a composite application would present a reasonable and helpful scheme of work. They even got to the point of considering the levelling of hedges, very wasteful hedges which we have in south Caernarvonshire, in order to combine fields. There would still be the delineation of tenancy and ownership, but, nevertheless, they would be farming over two fields for a specific purpose. It seems to me this is an Amendment which could commend itself to both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. John Hare)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I at this stage intervene. I am very grateful to the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) for having put down this Amendment. It enables me to clarify something which I should have clarified in my Second Reading speech, which I have made clear outside but have not made clear in the House of Commons, namely, that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent from happening the sort of thing about which the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) has been talking. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) is unfair both to the scheme I have in mind and to the Bill when he says that we could not do what I am just about to describe because of the weaknesses and restrictions of the legislation, and presumably of the scheme, that we are preparing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, we can do exactly the reverse of what the hon. Gentleman thinks. There is nothing at all, under the Bill as drafted or the intention I have in mind, to prevent a number of people—one or two or even three—coming together to work out a joint plan and so to speak, amalgamating those two or three farms for the purpose of farming under one common plan and qualifying under the small farmers scheme. I think that this is going to be a very useful by-product of the scheme. I believe that it will encourage quite a lot of voluntary amalgamation, and I join with the right hon. Gentleman in my dislike of the school of thought which believes that in order to deal with these fragmented holdings there should be some form of compulsory amalgamation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must not be too optimistic, but I think there are sound hopes that the Bill as it stands will encourage a number of neighbours to get together and adopt a common plan, and, as long as that plan comes within the acreage limitation and the standard man-days limitation, it will qualify as a single farm qualifies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would point to any paragraph in the White Paper, or indeed in the Bill, which gives him that power. We do not doubt his word or his intention, but we should like to know if any part of the White Paper gives an indication of this. I ask this question because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
of what the Parliamentary Secretary said in his Second Reading speech. He referred only to those who qualify under the scheme, and I quoted the words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These matters are complicated by the very way in which we have to do this—by an enabling Bill and a scheme which has not been published in detail. There is nothing in the Bill or the White Paper that would disqualify a number of people getting together to form a single farm business, which is what, in fact, they would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frederick Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the hon. Gentleman. We appreciate his intentions. I think he will also appreciate that there are some difficulties with regard to the Bill as at present drafted. There is a reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>" grants to any person for the time being carrying on a small farm business ".</p></blockquote>
That would seem, in the light of what the right hon. Gentleman has said, to call for a new definition in the Interpretation Clause, and I hope, whether the right hon. Gentleman agrees with me or not, that he will consider making this absolutely clear in that Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows very much more about the law and legal language than I do, but I have checked on this, and in Clause 1, to quote again the word which the hon. Gentleman has used, " grants to any person ", apparently in legal language " person " means persons as well. That I think covers his point. My legal advisers tell me that that is the legal interpretation of the word "person".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a person carrying on a small farm business. We are not quarelling about a business but about a joint enterprise, and there may be difficulties in defining a joint enterprise within the term " a small farm business ". I think it would be better, if the right hon. Gentleman takes this view of his Bill, to make it quite clear in the terms of the Bill itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is clear, but I will check up on that. If a number of persons come together and pool their farms to form a single farm business they can qualify under the scheme. They can still within their partnership, so to speak, retain the land which they put into that
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
partnership in their own name, but the combination of farms must be run as a single farm business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, therefore, very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for moving the Amendment. He rightly admits that its wording is not ideally suited to his purpose, and presumably he does not wish to press me to accept the Amendment. Although I cannot accept it, I can accept the spirit behind it. I have been given the chance to explain something which I should have explained on Second Reading. I apologise for not having done so then. I have, however, already explained the matter to the Press and to others who have asked me for details about the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said has given some pleasure to my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin). Having welcomed the very proper approach put forward by the Opposition—proper in that I entirely agree with it—I ask the right hon. Gentleman not to be naughty in trying to bring in a lot of party politics. If I may indulge in a little party politics for a moment, it is no use the right hon. Gentleman saying that my hon. Friends and the Government are, so to speak, neglecting a large section of the small farmers. We must face the fact that this is the first time that any Government have produced a Measure designed specifically to solve the small farmers' problems. Having indulged in that little bit of tit-for-tat and got that little bit of party politics off my chest, I will now sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman is serious in saying that this is the first time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not wish to pursue this point. I have allowed the tit-for-tat, and I should not have done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. E. G. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) will not withdraw the Amendment, because I regard it as one of the most important Amendments on the Order Paper. It raises a question that I have had in mind for a long time in a double form. First it enables small farmers to qualify by joining together, and, in the second place, it gives some of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
us the opportunity of pursuing the question of the value of co-operation among small fanners, about which we have been talking for a long time.

The Minister has given certain assurances. Whether they prove acceptable to my right hon. Friend, I do not know. However, he makes the very valid point that we want something worth while in the Bill as well as a speech by the Minister. We do not doubt the Minister's word for one moment, but if he could put into the Bill something that embodies what is in the minds of my right hon. Friend and of my hon. Friends he would be doing a real service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a matter of amalgamation, either voluntary or compulsory. If we can achieve a measure of amalgamation on a voluntary basis, all well and good, but I should be utterly opposed to any form of compulsory amalgamation of small farmers. On Second Reading I raised the question of small farmers joining together to qualify under the Bill. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary replied to the debate, but, unfortunately, he not only ignored the point that I put to him about co-operation, but went so far as to ignore my speech completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. J. B. Godber)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not complaining, but merely wish to point out that the Parliamentary Secretary could have considered what I think was one of the main points of my speech. He missed the opportunity on Second Reading, but I hope that the opportunity will not be missed today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is nothing proposed which will directly encourage co-operation among small farmers and, to my mind, there are at least two ways in which this might be done. In the first instance, two farmers whose holdings failed to satisfy the lower limit might, if they amalgamated and went into partnership, qualify for inclusion. Secondly, if a group of farmers came forward with development plans involving a scheme for some form of machinery syndicate, some of the farm business grant might be allowed for this purpose."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1958; Vol. 595, c. 98.]</p></blockquote>
I want today to stress the point that I made on that occasion. There is no suggestion in the Bill to encourage cooperation, among small farmers, but I
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
venture to suggest that that is a line that might be pursued and which would enable small farmers to qualify for a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend's Amendment clearly shows that the ideas we have in mind should be incorporated in the Bill. Whilst not rejecting the Minister's assurances, I appeal to him to have another look at the matter to see whether a form of words can be inserted in the Bill which will make his speech a reality when the Bill becomes an Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to hear from the Scottish Minister why he rejects the Amendment from the Scottish point of view. The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) has already stated the broad general argument from the Welsh point of view, and exactly the same argument applies to Scotland. If the Amendment is passed, greater agricultural output will be achieved by the co-operation of a number of small farmers. I detected in the Minister's speech last Thursday an element of criticism and opposition with regard to a case in Aberdeenshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In columns 88 and 89 of last Thursday's OFFICIAL REPORT, of this Committee's proceedings, my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) gave the illustration of a landed proprietor who had several small farms. My hon. Friend wondered whether the small farmer was really a big farmer who was trying to get something unjustifiable under the Bill. I am now speaking purely from the point of view of agriculture. If a landowner has several farms, why should the noble Lord say here, " You cannot do this ", when, in another place, he shows that by amalgamation and cooperation agricultural output would be increased? I should like the noble Lord to tell us why the Amendment is contrary to the best interests of agriculture in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency in which there is a very high standard of agriculture which has come about in certain areas very often by the amalgamation of very small farms. I am sure that the experience of the farming community in my area is that this is in the interests of agriculture and agricultural output. This is exactly the reverse of what we are sometimes accused, namely, of trying to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
compulsorily amalgamate from the central Department in Whitehall. I have often heard the Labour Party's programme criticised on the ground that we shall compulsorily turn smallholdings into large holdings. That has been the unfortunate experience in other countries. But what we propose is the very opposite of what, for example, has been done in the Soviet Union. We are not in any way attempting to force the small farmer into a bigger holding against his will, even though it may be agriculturally desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms of the Amendment, the application under the scheme must be made jointly by several persons who have to put in a joint application. Mr. MacBrown has to come to an agreement with Mr. MacWhite and Mr. MacBlack in order to be deemed to be " a single farm business ". It is not a question of forcing three reluctant Scottish farmers into the scheme. If it is decided that by amlagamation agricultural output would be increased, which is what the Minister wants, why does he resist the Amendment? I cannot understand it at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment points out that the Minister—that is, the noble Lord in Scotland—must be satisfied. The Amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… and the Minister is satisfied such persons will carry out their trades or businesses by co-operating in a manner approved by the Minister such trades or businesses shall be deemed to be a single farm business for the purposes of the scheme."</p></blockquote>
I indicated the argument on this point on Second Reading. Suppose that the Minister's advisers have two or three applications before them and come to the conclusion that, if three farmers cooperated in order to do something in the interests of all of them, it would result in greater agricultural efficiency and agricultural output. In these days of modern machinery, two or three farmers might come to an agreement which would result in the greater use of labour and the more efficient use of agricultural machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What on earth can be said against the Amendment? The farmers must be willing parties. It is not a matter of forcing reluctant farmers. The Minister has to agree to the proposal, and we think that in this matter he should take
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
the advice of his responsible agricultural advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the noble Lord to apply his hard-headed Scottish sagacity to this problem. I know that he is always prepared to listen to cogent and lucid arguments such as the one I am adducing. In his reference to the case in Aberdeenshire, the noble Lord gave the impression that he was turning down the idea put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East. My hon. Friend said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If I have five holdings of between 20 and 100 acres and can arrange them in such a way as to obtain a business grant for each of them, I can fix what crops to grow."</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The hon. Member should try and then see what answer he would get."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee A,</i> 27th November, 1958, c. 89.]</p></blockquote>
That is hardly a logical reply to a practical question, and my hon. Friend said: " It is possible," to which the noble Lord replied, " No," it was not possible. The noble Lord does not seem to have the open mind which the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has tried to display on the Amendment. He seems to have closed his mind to the idea of obtaining co-operation and in creating larger units which would be more agriculturally efficient even before consulting with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The small units that have been traditional in the past are not necessarily the laws of nature in agricultural development for all time. Small shops have given way to co-operative and multiple stores because the bigger units can arrange for a more efficient distribution of goods, and the same principle applies to agriculture. We cannot say that we must have a stereotyped small holding when it is manifest that it needs to be run in another way, and when farmers want to be run in another way and are prepared to co-operate. In such circumstances why should the iron hand of Whitehall or St. Andrew's House say " No "?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the noble Lord is not going to try to emulate the worst days of the Stalin régime in Russia. We do not want to enforce amalgamation on small peasants; we want their co-operation, so that they will come forward voluntarily in order to increase their output in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
interests of the nation as a whole. I appeal to the noble Lord to abandon his original attitude of opposition to the development of small holdings into larger holdings, and to say that in the case of Scotland—even if England has to be satisfied with vague promises—he will give a pledge to consider the matter and have inserted in the Bill a definite form of words to this effect, which I am sure will be approved by Scottish agricultural people in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderic Bowen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be deceiving ourselves if we assumed that the assurances given by the Minister covered the objects of the Amendment. They go some way to meet them, but there is much ground left quite untouched, even on the Minister's interpretation of the Bill. The Minister ought not to rely solely upon the wording of Clause 1. He should incorporate something much more positive embodying the ideas behind the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister relies upon his interpretation of the words " any person " as meaning " any persons ". Even upon his interpretation it would appear that two persons would not qualify under the Bill unless their business was strictly a partnership in law. If I am wrong about that I hope that the Minister will correct me, but I believe that unless there is a legal partnership, and that the two or more persons are for legal purposes made virtually into one person, Clause 1 will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that two small farmers prefer to put their heads together and work in co-operation to operate a scheme of this kind without formulating a legal partnership in respect of the whole of their farm business. Those persons would be excluded, even on the Minister's interpretation. If two persons with two small holdings amalgamate legally for the purpose of their business no difficulty would arise; it would obviously be one business, run by one legal unit. But the Amendment is not meant to cover those circumstances. It is intended to cover the circumstances to which I have previously referred. Two farmers may want to amalgamate completely their marketing and purchasing, and act co-operatively in most spheres, without entering into a strict legal partnership, and they should be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. E. L. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not keep the Committee for more than two minutes. I am glad of the assurances that the Minister has given. I do not think they can be effective unless something more is put into the Bill, but I take them to mean that he intends to see if something more can be done. I do not want to cover the ground which has been adequately covered by the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) as to the meaning of the word " person ", but I feel that the right hon. Gentleman has been a little too willing to accept an assurance as to the effect of that word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 makes provision for schemes for grants to any person who is carrying on a small farm business, and it later refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"increasing the efficiency of that business."</p></blockquote>
If two or three people come together in a partnership that would be a farm business, although I doubt very much whether it would be " that business ", as defined in the Clause. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider the question of interpretation with the greatest care, because the object of the Bill is to help the small farmer, in a way which has the support of almost everybody, by means of co-operation, and without the use of force. Where two or 'three small farmers gather together to increase their efficiency the Minister is being asked to grant their request to be regarded as one unit. I hope that he will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) are legal gentlemen. I want to reinforce what they said, so lucidly, from the point of view of the layman. We are dealing with delegated legislation. Until they were advised this morning neither the Minister nor the Joint Parliamentary Secretary knew that the word " person " included " persons ", and if they had difficulty in that matter how much more would the ordinary small farmer have difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member is not trying to malign me. I did know, and I said so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's Statement, but it is a pity that neither he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
nor his hon. Friend realised how important it was to make this clear in the Second Reading debate. The ordinary small farmer will want to buy this Bill in order to see how he stands, and he will not be able to understand it at the moment. I hope that the Minister will agree to add a form of words to the Clause, in the spirit of the Amendment, so as to make the position clear to everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. M. Philips Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied that the wording of the Clause does not cover the point raised by the Amendment. Something more specific is needed. We know of cases where small farmers, either owning their own land or renting it—or one owning it and the other renting it—carry on the same business together in the form of a joint ownership of stock, or crop the land together, for the purpose of the better and more efficient running of their holdings, the holdings nevertheless remaining separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the answers to the question of uneconomic small holdings. Rather than try to force one farmer out of business, leaving the other to take over his holding, it is better to run the two together. I hope that the Minister will see if he can produce something rather more specific between now and the report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. E. B. Hill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some interesting possibilities have been mentioned. We wish the Bill to encourage partnerships and the amalgamation of uneconomic small holdings upon a voluntary basis; there is no argument about that. Nonetheless, some of the suggestions made seem to be outside the ambit of the Bill, which seeks to tackle farm businesses. Suggestions about machinery pools have been made in connection with partial business grants, and they do not seem to fit into the Bill. In considering these various suggestions we must be careful not to trespass upon the preserves of existing agricultural co-operatives, which cover a different field of farming legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend said that if two farmers come together in partnership and put forward a joint suggestion it will be considered. In such a case it is probable that if the suggested joint business remains within the limit of man-days the two persons concerned will only be part-time
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
farmers, because if they were full-time farmers and each just failed on acreage their coming together would probably make the joint unit too large. Clause 1 (1, 
	<i>a</i>)
	<i></i> states that grants may be made
	<br><blockquote><p>" in respect of a farm business capable of yielding an adequate return to any person carrying it on with reasonable efficiency and as a full-time occupation."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether it will be permissible for a partnership to be accepted consisting of two people, neither of whom is a full-time farmer. A third person taking over the business might be a full-time worker, but the two original fanners who have decided to fuse their businesses in order to make a go of a joint operation might want to carry on their part-time activities of driving a lorry, being a sub-postmaster, or keeping an inn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point was clarified in our previous discussion. There is no reason why two part-time farmers should not get together in an amalgamation of this sort. So long as their man-days do not together add up to more than 450 they are completely at liberty to run the two holdings as one unit and carry on their existing part-time jobs. There is nothing to stop them doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That being clear, I think it obvious that the various situations which have been put to us can be met under the Bill as it stands. I hope therefore that we shall not divide on this Amendment because it seems to me unnecessary. I wish it to be known, however, that if we do divide, I shall reject the Amendment. But that does not mean that we wish in any way to discourage voluntary co-operation by farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a valuable discussion on this matter during which a number of points have been made clear. I wish to ask the Minister what would happen if he and I and the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. J. E. B. Hill) formed a company and indulged in a bit of sharp practice. Suppose we got 3,000 acres and divided it into small businesses comprising between 20 acres and 100 acres. Could I go to the Ministry and ask for a grant for those businesses? Are there safeguards against that? It is often the case that " sharks " look for loopholes of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
that kind in legislation. I am not being frivolous, I consider this a point which needs clarifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) was correct in what he said. The Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… any such class or description as may be specified in the scheme in connection with the carrying out of a programme for increasing the efficiency of that business."</p></blockquote>
Is it still "that business" if two or three people amalgamate? Is it not a completely different business following such an amalgamation or if an act of cooperation, in the semantic sense, takes place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to obtain approval for schemes made by persons who amalgamate and co-operate in a manner approved by the Minister. I do not see the necessity for anticipating legal complications because there is protection in the words, " approved by the Minister ". The Minister and his advisers are capable of giving or withholding approval without becoming involved in legal problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the right hon. Gentleman will be making a mistake if he does not accept this Amendment. But, nevertheless, it appears to me—unless I have misinterpreted what I heard him say—that he was willing to consider the matter, and that he was getting near to what has been asked of him. If the right hon. Gentleman can get so near that there is no need for us to divide on the Amendment, we shall have achieved something constructive in our efforts to assist farmers who have less than 20 acres. If that be the case, I would willingly allow the Minister his little political tit-for-tat and permit him to push out his political chest on any party platform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before asking leave to withdraw the Amendment, may I say that we have had a useful discussion; and that I agree that, in a Bill where there is flotsam and jetsam of one kind and another, it is difficult to achieve clarity. The hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) raised a legal point with which I cannot hope to deal, and other important matters have been referred to by my hon. Friends and by hon. Members opposite. But so long as
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
the Minister accepts the spirit of the Amendment, and by that I mean the principle of it, and can assure us that between now and the next stage of our proceedings he will not hesitate to endeavour to frame words which will achieve the result we desire, I shall be happy to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) for the friendly way in which he has put the position to me.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the Bill. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Gooch) has not understood what I said. I am satisfied that it is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will not happen is what was suggested by the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen). It will not allow a loose form of partnership, an unofficial partnership in which, for convenience sake, people decide to amalgamate a portion of their business—for example, their stock—but run their arable land separately. They would have to merge the whole of their farms into a single business, and by so doing they would qualify under the terms of the Bill. I think that was the intention expressed by the right hon. Member for Don Valley and by other hon. Members who have spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful discussion, and I will see whether or not what I have said is correct, that the Bill carries out that intention.

This is a very simple Amendment. It should commend itself to the Minister, and should be accepted by him without discussion. Its effect would be to give the Minister the power, if he needed it, to prepare a separate scheme for Wales. He already has that power in relation to other countries in the United Kingdom. The subsection contains permissive provision for schemes to meet the needs of the various parts of the United Kingdom, either singly or in combination. Indeed, it might be described as an exercise in territorial permutation, and one is unable to restrain one's admiration for the draftsmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the subsection provides for practically every other part of the United Kingdom, no provision is made even for the possibility of a separate scheme for Wales. This is extraordinary when one remembers that Wales could almost be described as a country where agriculture is almost entirely carried on by small farmers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) has reminded us more than once, nearly 50 per cent. of our Welsh farms comprise between 20 and 100 acres. That is, they come within the confines of this Bill. Even so, there is no provision for a special scheme for Wales, should it prove to be necessary.

During the Second Reading debate, the Parliamentary Secretary said that 9,000 or 10,000 Welsh farmers could apply. There will, of course, be a great number of border-line cases, all of which will have to be considered exactly as if they were cases coming directly within the provisions of this Measure. In fact, one-third of the full-time farmers in the Principality can be considered under the Bill, but there is still no possibility of a special scheme for Wales, should such a scheme be found to be necessary. According to paragraph 18 of the White Paper, there may be 65,000 applications throughout the United Kingdom as a whole. That means that one out of seven of them will be from Wales—yet Wales is the only part of the United Kingdom that is expressly excluded from the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may, and, I suppose, could be said by the Minister, in extenuation, that only
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
one scheme will be necessary in the United Kingdom. So far, however, he does not know, so he provides himself with powers in case it should not be so. For instance, if such a scheme is found necessary for Scotland, the subsection gives him the requisite powers. But if he is advised that a separate scheme is necessary for Wales, he cannot, without becoming 
	<i>ultra vires,</i> create a special scheme there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that he is arbitrarily, not only ignoring the clear fact of special Welsh conditions but is shutting himself off from all possibility of coping properly with those special conditions. It may be that he does not agree that Wales, like England and Scotland, is, indeed, a country in its own right within the United Kingdom. On the other hand, the Prime Minister informed the House the other day that it is the aim and intention of the Government to see that Wales, as a nation, is recognised in the affairs of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we have the admittedly doubtful advantage of the appointment of the present Minister for Welsh Affairs and the creation of a Minister of State for Welsh Affairs. There is also in being a Government-created national body—the Council for Wales. That still survives, in spite of the attentions of the present Government. The Council has quite strong recommendatory functions, even if it has no executive powers, and one of its most striking recommendations relates to Welsh agriculture and rural life, and agricultural administrative devolution has recently been somewhat strengthened in the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are all evidence of the recognition of the position of Wales. That being so, this exclusion of the Principality from a purely permissive subsection cannot be sustained. The Minister should look at this from two points of view. First of all, there is an undoubted feeling in Wales that this casual, perfunctory treatment of my country in this drafting is not good enough. There is also a very strong feeling that there may be technical agricultural reasons why one of these separate schemes might need to be a Welsh one. The figures that I have given—and they have been repeated both here and during the Second Reading debate—are themselves evidence of the special conditions in Wales.

	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
I appeal to the Minister, and to both sides of the Committee to make this small concession. It will not cost the Minister anything. It will not disturb his Bill. It will not cause his draftsmen or his Ministerial assistants any difficulty. It will simply write into the Bill the permissive provision for which I ask. This may be a small thing to him but it is a substantial thing to us, who wish, voluntarily, to co-operate, if I may say so, in the affairs of the United Kingdom, but not to be compulsorily amalgamated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I hope that the Minister will grant this small concession, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) says, it will at least recognise the nature of the occupants of the Principality. In case there are some here who do not believe that we are a nation apart, let me give my reasons for that assertion. First, I would remind hon. Members that my ancestors were here before any of theirs were—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No—not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept what the hon. Member may say about my own ancestors, but the fact remains that his speech must be related to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to persuade both sides of the Committee to accept the Amendment. I was about to say, Mr. Diamond, that it would be a good thing were you to look at the picture behind you, to see what the ancestors of those to whom I refer did when they tried to emulate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a nation apart. We have our own language, which we habitually speak. Except when I am here in Parliament, I rarely speak English—I have no need to. In a few days I shall be addressing a conference in my constituency, when practically every word spoken will be in my own native tongue. Any country that has its own peculiar language is a nation apart. Incidentally, our's is the oldest language in the world, because it is recognised to have been the language used in the Garden of Eden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long way from the Garden of Eden to this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point order, Mr. Diamond. Would not the Garden of
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
Eden come under the heading of a small farm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have our own language, and, had it been in order, I could have seconded the Amendment in that language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have our own literature, which, again, clearly indicates that we are a nation apart. We have our own way of life. We have our own way of husbandry—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And my hon. Friends have their own Amendment, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister to drop this cant. The phrase, constantly repeated, " England and Wales " sickens me. It seems to me that whenever it is used the voice is usually dropped on the second word. It should always read " England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland." An hon. Friend asks, " Why not Cornwall?" Well, we absorbed Cornwall into Wales years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seriously, however, I hope that the Minister will agree to the Amendment. As my hon. Friend has said, it may seem a small thing here, but it means a great deal to Wales. I want to go back to Wales at the end of the week and be able to declare that, at least by one Saxon Minister, our ancient blood is recognised, in a small way but a good way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. The Minister for Welsh Affairs has been making a great song and dance about the amount of administrative devolution extended to Wales by the Ministry of Agriculture, but it seems difficult to reconcile what we have heard about that with the wording of the subsection as it stands. Why should it not be envisaged that it might be desirable for Wales to have a scheme of her own; and that England might like to have a scheme of her own?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed that not one Englishman has thought fit to speak on behalf of England on this point. Of all the schemes that are possible, the one that is excluded is one for Wales on her own or one for England on her own. Why should it be possible for Northern Ireland to have its own scheme, and not for England to have one, or Wales to have one? It might be much more appropriate to have the same scheme
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
for Wales and Northern Ireland, but, with the present wording, that is not possible. I think that by the present wording the Minister has unduly cramped his style in designing what scheme or schemes should be put into operation. It seems to me that when he comes to consider this matter he might find it far more suitable for Wales to have a scheme of her own, or for England to have a scheme of her own, or for Wales to join with parts of the United Kingdom other than England. I urge that the Amendment be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting the Amendment, I am not admitting, as the hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) said, that Cornwall came after Wales, but that Cornwall was once known as West Wales, and I have a shrewd suspicion Wales was colonised from Cornwall. Be that as it may, one cannot be in the House of Commons very long before realising that Wales has its special problems. It is a nation on its own. There is a certain similarity between Wales and Cornwall. At the last General Election the Minister's predecessor went to Brecon and Radnor to speak for the Conservative candidate. He also came to speak for the Conservative candidate in my constituency. Both constituencies returned Labour candidates. At our last meeting we were discussing the possibility of special schemes of afforestation and farming in mid-Wales. I support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Emrys Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Scottish Members, I support this claim for a separate scheme for Wales. I understand that if the Amendment were carried it would be necessary to have a Minister representing Wales in this Committee. In that respect, I do not ask for any privileged position for Scotland. We have a Minister—I do not say he is a great asset to us, but at least we have a Minister. As long as he is there we still have a hope. But the Welsh have no Minister, and they have no hope. This is an intolerable position as far as Wales is concerned, and I suggest that the Minister should make some small concession. Even the Prime Minister has made certain concessions, realising the importance of Wales in the scheme of things, by making some arrangements for a new Minister. I would
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
suggest that an alteration of this kind may mean to him only a small verbal alteration, but it will be something which Wales, especially North Wales, takes very seriously indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to some of the most eloquent speeches that have been delivered in this Committee—with great respect to the Front Bench—but, tempted as I would be to agree, on very serious consideration I think it would not be desirable to accept the Amendment. I am not doing this because of my irritation at being called a Saxon. I am not a Saxon, I am a Celt. My family came from Ireland. It is a very serious thing to accuse a Celt of being a Saxon, but it is not in that spirit of hurt feelings that I reject the Amendment. I reject it because I think the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) who so very skilfully moved the Amendment, asked me to make a radical departure from what has been the normal practice in dealing with the question of agricultural administration affecting England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of words in the Clause which we are discussing, subsection (2), is common to a number of Acts dealing with agricultural grants and subsidies, and I do not think that this Bill is a proper place in which to introduce what would be a far-reaching change of the kind the hon. Gentleman is putting forward. He knows, as I do, that Wales is very much the land of the small farmer. Thanks to visits I have made to Wales, I have been able to gain a lot of useful information in drawing up the very measures we are discussing. I believe Wales will benefit very largely indeed from the action we are proposing. It will certainly benefit Wales more than the part of the world where the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) lives or where I myself live. It is, therefore, by my recognition of the needs of so many small farmers in Wales that I have been largely guided in bringing forward the proposals we are discussing. I know hon. Gentlemen representing Welsh constituencies would not do me the injustice of saying that I do not care or have not considered the needs of the small farmers in Wales. That would not be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot accept the Amendment. I think this would be entirely the wrong place to make a completely new departure in what has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
our normal practice, but I can assure all those who have Wales at heart that I will do nothing to injure the interests of the small farmers there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself profoundly disappointed with the Minister's reply. I have no doubt that his sympathy for Wales, and especially for the Welsh farmer, is a genuine one, but I feel that he has interpreted the Amendment quite wrongly. There is nothing in it to effect a break with normal practice. All it does is to change the phraseology of a subsection so as to enable the Minister, if he so finds it necessary, to prepare a scheme for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill sets no precedent whatsoever. The arguments used by the right hon. Gentleman have no bearing on the specific point raised by the Amendment. I</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speak in detail on the Question " That the Clause stand part of the Bill ". I realise that we are confined to the Clause as it is. In spite of, I hope, helpful discussion, we have not succeeded in having any Amendments accepted. I cannot, therefore, say anything about loans. The Clause, as drafted, shows how dominated the Conservative Party is by bankers. I do not know if the hon. Gentleman has been a banker, but it is quite likely that he will be one after the next General Election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause could have been more effectively drawn. We are obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the reconsideration which he has given to some of the points, but I want to deal with two broad issues which arise on consideration of the Clause. I have no wish to turn to the White Paper. We will have an opportunity later for discussing the proposals</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>

	<p>cannot think that the right hon. Gentleman has properly thought out the implications involved. I hope that he will not reject the matter out of hand, but will look at it again. It is a narrow point, confined to the Bill. I agree that by accepting this, as he might do after consideration, it will raise the general question, but it will not be his responsibility. Certainly his arguments will not be well received in Wales by the National Farmers' Union. I will not withdraw my Amendment, but I hope that the Minister will have something more constructive to say.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That " and " stand part of the Clause:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 20, Noes 13.</p>

	<p>of the Government. I am content to say for the moment that I am unenthusiastic.</p>

	<p>Dealing, first of all, with the question of the Annual Review, I know that the Minister, like the Chancellor in his Budget, will tell me that he cannot be expected to anticipate the Annual Review. May I put one or two matters to him? After all, the Clause and the scheme which will be made as a result of the Clause are related to the Annual Review. The first point I put is the position generally of the small farmer. We have had recently the N.F.U.'s Farm Accounts Scheme results—</p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman will tell me how this matter, if he proposes to discuss it at any length, is related to the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. The Government have been good enough, in preparation of the debate on the Clause, to issue a White Paper. That White Paper shows
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
that the scheme which they have in mind is to be financed on the Annual Review. It was for that reason that I proposed to ask one or two questions about the scheme or schemas which the Government may introduce under the Clause and their effect on the price review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite see how the hon. Gentleman can raise that matter, interesting though it is, at the moment. We are discussing a Bill which enables us to make a scheme. We are not discussing the scheme. The scheme as such will, as he rightly says, be taken into consideration as part of the Annual Review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, I have no wish to pursue the matter over a wide field. Perhaps I could now do what I was proposing to do. I wish to call attention to the N.F.U.'s Farm Accounts Scheme results, which have recently been published. I do not want to deal with the matter in any detail. The results are well summarised in the N.F.U.'s own language. Attention is called to the fact that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A disappointing feature of the 1956–57 results was that, over the sample as a whole, the average income of farmers in the ' 50 acres and under ' group declined "—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman keeps interrupting, he will provoke a wide discussion. We are entitled to pay attention to a review which reveals the position of small farmers. That is relevant to any scheme under the Clause. I had better begin again:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A disappointing feature of the 1956–57 results was that, over the sample as a whole, the average income of farmers in the ' 50 acres and under ' group declined. On every type of farm, the small farmer fared relatively worse than the larger farmer, in spite of the fact that output on the small farms, as on the larger farms, increased."</p></blockquote>
I believe that one can assume that this tendency has persisted over the past year. We have to recognise—and this is related to Price Review policy—that the relative position of small farmers has deteriorated over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I put to the right hon. Gentleman arising from that is this: Does he think that in that context he is likely to do sufficient to help the small farmer by virtue of any scheme under the Clause? As I said, I do not want to pursue this matter in detail. We know the
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
amount of aid, £6 million, which will be syphoned off the Annual Review to help the small farmers. If we consider these figures and at the same time estimate the disadvantage which the small farmer has suffered, it would appear at once that this is a very small amount of aid to small farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second general point which I put to the right hon. Gentleman is this, and it again arises out of Annual Review policy. Recently we have had several studies both into the position of the small farmers and into the broader question of the marginal farmer. The studies have shown quite conclusively that the small farmer and, in particular, the marginal farmer get relatively far less from the price support than the volume of their output would justify. Again, I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he has paid sufficient attention to these investigations and inquiries and whether he thinks that such a modest readjustment is a sufficient support to the small farmer and to the farmer of marginal land to recompense them for the very harmful effects of the Government's policy upon the production both of the small farmer and of the farmer of marginal land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point that I put to the right hon. Gentleman is this. I think that we are entitled to have from him a general statement about his policy on the next Annual Review. If the award of the next Annual Review follows the trend of previous awards, the small farmers are bound to be affected. I can see that the right hon. Gentleman is embarrassed, but we are entitled to have a statement, because he has already said in advance that he proposes to load on to the Annual Review the £6 million which are necessary to support the small farmers as a result of the scheme. Will he tell us broadly what he has in mind for the next Annual Review? In particular, will he tell us what his policy will be about pigs, milk and eggs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not for one moment allege that the right hon. Gentleman has created the small farmer's problems, but I think it is conceded by everyone that the policies of the Government have so aggravated the position of the small farmers that they have been driven to take the steps that they are taking today. If, as the White Paper indicates, the right bon. Gentleman has in mind taking this step regarding the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
Annual Review, he is under an obligation to give us a general assurance that, apart from this specific aid that is to be given to the small farmers, the position of the small farmers will not be prejudiced in any way by next year's Annual Review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular reason for asking for this assurance. It is significant that the right hon. Gentleman has gone out of his way to call in aid the 
	<i>Economist.</i> I warn the Committee that if the 
	<i>Economist</i> supports the Government in agricultural policy we had better look very carefully at that policy. The 
	<i>Economist</i> says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the scheme is to benefit the national economy, there will have to be further downward revisions at the next and subsequent price reviews."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman stands by the 
	<i>Economist.</i> Is that the view that he takes? The 
	<i>Economist</i> has come to this conclusion after examining the White Paper. We are all aware of the going-downwards escalator provided for in the 1957 Act, but if the 
	<i>Economist</i> is right, then this is not a broad scheme designed to help the small farmers, but a scheme which is designed to ameliorate the effect of subsequent Annual Reviews on small farmers. We are entitled to press the Government to give us an assurance that in formulating schemes under the Clause they will at the same time refrain from taking any steps under the Annual Review which will aggravate the position of small farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word or two about the discriminatory effect of the Clause. It is clear that the Clause will not cover all small farmers. The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) has asked the Government to give an assurance that they will immediately introduce a further Bill. Even the 
	<i>Economist</i> recognises that there is a social problem here. We have endeavoured to widen the scope of the Bill but have failed. I cannot discuss that matter now, but I invite the right hon. Gentleman to take the opportunity—he was in difficulties over an earlier Amendment—to say whether the Government have any plans to deal with the social side of the problem. Even the 
	<i>Economist</i> recognises that there is a social side to this problem which demands aid outside the aid which can be strictly called agricultural support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter upon which I should like to touch concerns the National Agri-
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
cultural Advisory Service. I will afford the right hon. Gentleman the opportunity of correcting one or two remarks which may have caused an erroneous impression. In the first place, I call attention to the fact that it is not a tribute to the N.A.A.S. to say that it is not competent to assess the credit-worthiness of a farmer. What the N.A.A.S. is being asked to do is to decide whether other people's money can be granted to farmers, the other people being farmers generally. If the right hon. Gentleman rests his case on the inability of the N.A.A.S. to make such an assessment, that is a reflection on its ability to make the broad decision which must be made as to whether a farm business should be viable or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which I want to raise arises from what the Parliamentary Secretary said. To paraphrase his argument, I think he said that the purpose of the scheme is to attract small farmers, by a financial bait, to accept the services of the N.A.A.S. Again, I recognise that that is one of the purposes of the Bill, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not like this to be felt as a reflection on the service that it requires any such bait. The broad point that I want to raise about the National Agricultural Advisory Service concerns its insufficiency in numbers. All that we got by way of reassurance from the Parliamentary Secretary was that the N.A.A.S. is recruiting all the time. The Government must take some responsibility for the failure to recruit sufficient people for the Service. The Grassland Utilisation Report points out that the Service should be strengthened and built up by a further 25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government considering the matter? I have no views on it because this is a matter which needs very careful consideration, but are the Government considering the suggestions made about taking non-graduates? This is of particular import to the present discussion. Are the Government doing anything about the suggestion that there should be farm management training, both initial and in-service training? Time is already very late, and we should be doing something about it if something is to be done. We have to face the fact that this is a service which has bad career prospects, and we ought, therefore, to consider ways and means of improving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
the prospects for people entering the Service if we want it to expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to the point made by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Hurd) on Second Reading. The hon. Gentleman often thinks aloud about things which the Government do subsequently. He recognised that the Government would face a real problem if there were a redeployment of the advisory services, which are already thin on the ground. He suggested that the industry ought to cater for itself and seek ways and means of providing its own advisory services. I ask the Government to tell us frankly whether they are thinking along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of some importance and merits very thorough examination. It happens to be in line with the idea behind some of the suggestions made in the Arton Wilson Report. I am not expressing a particular point of view in this matter, but if the Government are deliberately accepting this as a possible consequence of the present scheme we should be told so frankly. This would entirely change the position of the N.A.A.S.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member's suggestion has disturbed members of the N.A.A.S. They feel that they may become redundant in time, and that in the eyes of the Government the present scheme is a short-term one.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will statutory smallholders who qualify as being within the acreage and man-days provisions come within the scheme? In some respects statutory smallholders have been debarred, and I am anxious to know their position in relation to qualifying for grants under the scheme. In the course of his reply to one of the debates this morning the Minister pointed out that in the eastern counties, and especially Norfolk and
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
Suffolk, very few small farmers are likely to qualify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hare</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the eastern counties would not benefit to anything like the extent that Wales would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's assurance that that is what he said. But the Secretary of the National Farmers' Union in Norfolk has stated that of the many applications for advice that he has received in respect of small farms in Norfolk, only one appears to come within the scheme so far. I speak in the absence of any hon. Member representing a Welsh constituency, but there is a very interesting statement in the last issue of the 
	<i>Farmers Weekly.</i> It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only about one-tenth of Welsh lowland dairy farms are likely to qualify for aid under the Small Farmer Scheme—and the same is probably true of the rest of the country. This conclusion has been drawn by Mr. E. A. Attwood, of the Department of Agricultural Economics, University College of Wales, after analysing 183 farms of between 20 and 100 acres.… Not one dairy farm of more than 50 acres on reasonably good land qualified out of a sample of 26 and only 6 farms of the same type but under 50 acres qualified out of a sample of 29."</p></blockquote>
In the face of those figures for Wales it certainly looks as if very small farmers in the eastern counties, where the land may be richer and the stocking and cropping more intensive, are likely to qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If very few of the lowland farms in Wales are likely to qualify, what will be the position of the hill farms? Here I quote from the Second Reading debate, in which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was asked one or two particular questions by the hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) and I will try to answer as many of them as possible. He asked about farmers who already had hill farming schemes. I am afraid they are ruled out, whether it be for farm improvement schemes or the small farmer schemes. There cannot be more than one comprehensive scheme running at the same time."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th November, 1958; Vol. 595, c. 150.]</p></blockquote>
I can understand that if a current hill farming scheme is in operation, and grants are being made, the farms concerned are disqualified, but the first sentence of the Minister's reply indicates that if they have had a grant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What I meant to convey was that those who had the schemes running at the present time would be debarred, but not those whose schemes were completed.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be something wrong if, after considerable assistance had been given under the Hill Farming Act, a farm had not been brought up to a state when, to use a word now in current use, it had become viable. The Whole purpose of the Hill Farming Act was to enable hill farms to become profitable. Why is it that now, after having received special subsidies which were denied to other types of farms, those who got in early and have received special assistance under the Hill Farming Act can also qualify for the small farmer scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir A. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has given us statistics concerning the number of lowland farmers who would not qualify. I am not sure whether those farmers fail to qualify because they do not have the 275 standard man-days, or are so efficient that they are above the upper qualifying number of standard man-days. It is important to know why they are disqualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the Report that they are disqualified because they have more 'than 450 man-days. They are regarded as being so efficient as not to need further assistance under the small farmer scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
Although certain farmers may have had much greater assistance under the hill farming scheme, it appears that they can also qualify for special assistance under the small farmer scheme. That means that there is something wrong with the state of farming, the general price system, or that the costs of production in those areas are very great, as compared with the rest of the country. It looks as if many farmers in Wales will not receive anything like the amount of assistance which has been indicated from time to time, and that situation appears likely to prevail throughout the United Kingdom. There is a belief that the figures so far quoted as to the numbers who will qualify are above what can be obtained under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union has made it clear that as the scheme is now drawn the number of holdings which will qualify is not nearly sufficient. The types of farmer who will be left out are those who ought to have been included. Why is it that the two fences which are erected around those who can qualify, namely, the fences of acreage and man-days per year, are so rigid? If the acreage is the minimum of 20, but the cropping does not indicate that 250 man-days are required, the farmer concerned will not qualify for a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is a sound argument why should not the process operate in reverse, so that the farmer who has an acreage of less than 20, but whose stocking and cropping comes within the limits of 250 and 450 man-days, qualifies? The type of soil and the situation can vary from place to place. There is a very sound reason why either the 20 acres or the 250 man-days should form the lower limit of qualification, but not both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are hard distinctions between neighbours, so that one is eligible for the grant and the next one is not, the scheme will get a bad name. Wherever the money comes from, it must be distribute through the agency of the Minister's officers. They will have to visit the small farms and decide which will qualify. They may be welcomed on one farm with cups of tea and all the rest from the farmer's wife, whereas they may be called all sorts of names—many of them unparliamentary—on the next farm, after they have announced that that farm will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
not qualify, although, on the surface, both farms may seem to be within the same category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should be prepared to reconsider his position and not be so rigid in his outlook. He should listen to the sound advice preferred by the National Farmers' Union and others who regard this problem from a practical point of view rather than from the standpoint of tidy administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I listened with interest to the explanations from the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the definition of a part-time farmer. What kind of part-time farmer is likely to be classified as a full-time farmer? It may be the rich farmer who works part-time but who employs labour on his holding; or the farmer whose family spend their weekends working on the holding. Such a farmer, who may be part-time himself, may, with the assistance of his family, bring his cropping and stock within the specified 250 man-days. Another man working exactly the same kind of holding, but receiving no assistance from his family and not employing labour, would be debarred from benefiting under the provisions of this Clause. Neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary gave a reasoned or fair definition of what kind of part-time farmer will be able to qualify as a full-time farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) explained why he withdrew his support for the Amendment. The hon. Gentleman recognised that this Clause needed amendment and improvement. But he said that if the scope of the Clause was widened to include other small farmers, too much work would fall on the officials. The hon. Gentleman also expressed the hope that the Minister would soon introduce another Bill to deal with such farmers. I do not see any difference between the amount of work which would be involved by improving and extending the provisions of the Bill and bringing in another Bill immediately this Measure becomes law. The hon. Member for Leominster does not usually advance lame excuses, but this was about the lamest excuse I have ever heard him make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is designed to benefit small farmers, and, whatever the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
may do in the future, we must do our best to improve it. Unless the Minister is prepared to consider the weighty arguments which have been advanced, both in the country and by hon. Members, I think that he will miss a valuable opportunity to improve the Bill. I hope, therefore, that in our further discussions on the Clause the Minister will be able to say that, on reflection, he has decided that at a later stage he will amend the Clause, and thus improve the Bill, and provide further assistance for small farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir A. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak, but my name has been bandied about rather freely. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) said that I do not usually make lame excuses. I did not make a lame excuse when I spoke during the first sitting of the Committee, and I repeat what I said then. I sympathise with the idea of excluding the acreage basis test. I do not support the Amendment because the Minister has made plain that, in his opinion, its acceptance would bring in too many claims and embarrass the National Agricultural Advisory Service. I hope that my right hon. Friend, after he has seen the way in which the Measure will work, will realise that unfairness which will result in many instances, and will consider introducing another Bill to deal with the case of farmers who have under 20 acres, or who do not qualify under the man-days standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even at this late stage I hope that my right hon. Friend will withdraw the 20-acre minimum and will rely entirely on the standard man-days. To me it is absurd that a man who is doing a good job on an 18-acre holding, and who can show the requisite man-days standard does not receive assistance, whereas a man with 21 acres, who may not be doing such a good job, qualifies for assistance. The man-days standard provides a better definition of a small farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise the difficulty of obtaining the best definition of a small farmer. We discussed that for a long time. The suggestion in the Bill is ingenious, but it is capable of improvement, and it may result in hardship and anomalies which it would be a good thing to reduce. The Ministry is of opinion that if farmers with under 20 acres are included we shall get into the category of hobby farmers or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
specialists. I do not think there are as many hobby fawners or specialists farming between 10 and 20 acres, as there are farming between 20 and 30 acres. If a man is a specialist and if he qualifies, I think he should be assisted. I know it is argued that such a man buys his feedingstuffs from abroad, and produces bacon or poultry, or whatever it may be. But the same argument could be applied to a motor car manufacturer Who buys his raw materials from abroad. If a specialist can turn 20s. worth of food into 30s. worth of bacon or poultry, I think he should be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not support the Amendment, I hope that my right hon. Friend will extend some hope of recognition to farmers with under 20 acres. Everyone agrees that the 20-acre basis is unfair and should be discarded. The National Farmers' Union and similar bodies are of that opinion, and are unanimous that the standard man-day test is sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir A. Baldwin) is making his speech from the wrong side of the Committee, and he is mistaken if he thinks that the Minister will accept anything he has said. But I agree with almost all that was said by the hon. Gentleman and I am sure that the Cornish farmers would also agree. They have informed me that so highly efficient are many of our people, that the man-days maximum qualification will debar a large proportion of them from benefitting under the provisions of this Bill. As has been said time and again in this Committee at least 45 per cent. of all the holdings in the country are less than 20 acres, and a large number of them are also disqualified from obtaining assistance under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been asked who will pay the grants. Paragraph 19 of the White Paper is clear on the subject. The total cost will be £9 million, of which £3 million will be recouped from one scheme or another and the remaining £6 million will come out of the next Annual Review. So that two classes of farmers, those who are efficient and are disqualified under the man-days standard and those farming below the qualifying acreage, will be required to receive less at the next Annual Review in order to find the money for the scheme as it exists at present.

	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
I think it relevant to quote the title of Clause 1.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schemes for grants for increasing efficiency of small farm businesses."</p></blockquote>
I wish also to quote an opinion about this Scheme of a constituent of mine. He is a life-long Conservative and, I think, holds office in the local Conservative Party organisation in my division. He said recently in 
	<i>The West Briton and Royal Cornwall Gazette:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Hayman could tell Parliament from the Cornish farmers that it was one of the most ridiculous schemes ever put on record. Those responsible for it must be under average intelligence "</p></blockquote>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill is an experiment and Clause 1 represents the main part of it.

It puts an entirely different point of view from that expressed by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye).

I wish to read an extract from the draft minutes of the Scottish National Farmers' Union. The President said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Council would accept that the farmer with the smaller business has special difficulties in finding the means for modern productive methods and should have special help at this juncture which should be designed to give him the chance to put his business on a sound basis. At the same time it was realised that this involved a new principle of special treatment according to the size of unit which must not be allowed to go too far and displace the proper basic principle of payment by results or payment to encourage particular types or methods of production."</p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
Scottish National Farmers' Union is prepared to accept the Bill and to try to make a success of the Scheme. It issues a warning against the new principle of helping the farmer according to the size of his holding rather than the amount of production, but it accepts the Bill as an experiment to help small farmers in these exceptional circumstances. I think that important. I should like my right hon. Friend to bear in mind the point that it is an experiment, and that if we have to lay down hard and fast limits in the first scheme, there should be flexibility later. The Bill starts by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate Minister may by a scheme or schemes.…"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
Are we limited to one scheme for each country? I hope that as time goes on we shall not be limited in such a way. If we find that the administrative service is adequate, and if there are anomalies or hardships, I hope that further schemes may be introduced to extend the provisions, or to retract them, for the man with 20 acres at one end of the scale and the man with 150 acres at the other, as and when opportunity offers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
