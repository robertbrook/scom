	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT HOVERCRAFT (APPLICATION OF ENACTMENTS) (AMENDMENT) ORDER 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) (Amendment) Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
I should like to make a few comments about the order. I promise not to speak until 12 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order is simple and straightforward: it is to apply consequential amendments to the Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) Order 1972 necessitated by the introduction of revised Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules and amendments to the 1977 Collision Regulations and Distress Signals Order respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why these two amendments are necessary, but it may assist the Committee if I first briefly recall that the Hovercraft Act 1968 provides that hovercraft should be treated as vehicles in their own right, as opposed to ships or aircraft. The essential need to ensure that relevant safety and navigational disciplines are appropriately observed by hovercraft operating in a marine environment is, however, self-evident and is recognised in the Act. This point can, perhaps, be best illustrated by the impressive fact that, in 1977, approaching 2 million passengers and more than ¼ million vehicles crossed the Channel by hovercraft, representing a very significant proportion of all passengers and vehicles on the cross-Channel ferry traffic. Against this background, I am sure that it is unnecessary for me to emphasise to the Committee the considerable importance that my Department rightly attaches to ensuring that relevant marine safety measures are extended to hovercraft operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is achieved through the Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) Order 1972, made under powers conferred in the Hovercraft Act 1968, which applies to hovercraft a number of enactments and instruments relating to ships, including those which give rise to the amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
order now before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendments in question. Both have an international connotation and reflect the Government's commitment to international agreement, through the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, as the most effective means of regulation and enforcement in the field of maritime safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules 1965 have been revised and up-dated in part to take account of the development of containerisation and, in particular, to reflect recommendations in the 1978 report of the Department's Standing Advisory Committee on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods in Ships and the classifications in the corresponding 1977 IMCO dangerous goods code. The Standing Advisory Committee's report—which hon. Members will probably recall as the Blue Book—is expected to be published next month. This will coincide with the new dangerous goods rules embodied in SI 1978 No. 1543, laid before Parliament on 26th October, which come into operation on 29th December. The current, that is 1965, dangerous goods rules will therefore be revoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is accordingly necessary to amend the existing reference to the dangerous goods rules in the 1972 hovercraft order. This is achieved through a simple change in part B of schedule 1 to the 1972 order. In effect, it will apply the provisions of the 1978 dangerous goods rules to United Kingdom registered hovercraft, and to all other hovercraft within United Kingdom territorial waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment to the Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) Order is essentially one of detail. The 1977 Collision Regulations and Distress Signals Order derives from international regulations drawn up under the auspices of IMCO. The 1977 regulations include provisions for improved lights and signals and new rules designed to assist the safe passage of vessels in confined waters, particularly in traffic separation schemes. I should explain that these regulations were substantively applied to hovercraft in July last year through an amending order similar to that which the Committee is now considering. But the 1977 collision regulations have themselves been amended. I do not think that it is necessary for me this morning to rehearse to the Committee the two amendments to the Merchant Shipping Collision Regulations. Neither
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
is of substance, but, nevertheless, it is necessary to translate these to hovercraft by inserting the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"as amended by Statutory Instrument 1977/1301 and Statutory Instrument 1978/462 "</p></blockquote>
at the appropriate point in part B of schedule 1 to the 1972 hovercraft order. The operative date for this amendment is also 29th December 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, therefore, the two amendments have the effect of applying the latest Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules and collision regulations to hovercraft engaged in maritime operations. I have no doubt that the Committee will agree that it is essential to ensure that relevant and up-to-date marine safety regulations are so applied and that the proposed amendment order achieves a necessary objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.35 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that this is very much a tidying-up operation, the amendments being editorial, so to speak. However, it does give me an opportunity to make three points in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although one accepts that hovercraft are to be treated in the same way as ships, it must be recognised that, at present, hovercraft do not carry cargo as such. As one of the operators has pointed out to me, the present generation of hovercraft would not be affected by the dangerous goods rules; they do not carry cargo, other than drive-on/drive-off vans or small lorries, and as for small packages or containers, I understand that during the last year there have been only two or three inquiries about carrying them. We are therefore looking to the future and this is a moment to reflect on what the future holds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of hovercraft has always been very exciting and, no doubt, in the future there will be a new generation of hovercraft, including variants such as hover freighters, hover freight barges and super hovercraft of some kind to carry cargo in bulk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hesitate to stop the hon. Gentleman but I do not think that we need look too much to the future in our discussions. May we stick fairly closely to the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to your ruling, Mr. Wells, I feel that it is a moment in which to look forward and consider how the rules are to apply. I thought it relevant
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to point out that they do not apply to the present generation of hovercraft. We are now, in fact, legislating for the future and, in that context, I thought it wise to refer to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when one checks the Blue Book to which the Minister referred, one finds it obvious that not only do present hovercraft not carry cargo but that most of these rules do not apply to hovercraft. They clearly are to apply to conventional ships with the hull in the water. Is it appropriate, therefore, to apply 
	<i>in toto</i> rules which are not in the context of hovercraft or any form of hover transport? Would it not be better to use some other way of ensuring that dangerous cargoes are not carried?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads us immediately to the fact that the Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for issuing safety certificates to ensure that a hovercraft is hover-worthy. Would it not be possible for the Civil Aviation Authority to issue a certificate introducing a condition prohibiting cargoes of dangerous goods? I recognise that such a condition might be lengthy and complicated—which leads me to my third point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that hovercraft are vehicles in their own right. There has been a great deal of debate in the House of Commons about whether they should be regarded as ships, as air vehicles or as vehicles on land—when, of course, they travel on land. As I say, the Minister said that they should be regarded in their own right, so would it not be much more satisfactory for hovercraft operators to have their own code for the carriage of dangerous goods? Such a code would, in my opinion, be simple and easy to draw up and would be clearly applicable to hovercraft. That, of course, is not the case with the Blue Book, although some of those rules and regulations are very welcome in their application to hovercraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made those three points, I should like to explain to the Minister that my purpose is to ensure that hovercraft operators and manufacturers are not submerged in a welter of red tape. It is difficult at present for them to know exactly what their position is without referring to a whole host of regulations, Acts and codes. That, indeed, is a mammoth task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it not be simpler—and have we not now reached a stage at which we should take the Minister up on what he said—to treat hovercraft in their own right as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
special craft and give them their own codes which clearly relate to the work they are designed to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those reservations, I welcome the order on behalf of the Opposition. Clearly, it is important that there should be safety at sea and that we should ensure that the sort of goods referred to in the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules are not carried on hovercraft without the most stringent precautions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Warren</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While bowing, Mr. Wells, to your ruling and your wise leadership about legislation being about the future, I must point out that I have support from my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Hunt) on the question of the present Government legislating about the past. If the Minister can assure us that we are talking about the future and not about the past, that would be a step forward in the Government's favour. I have yet to be convinced that this order is as good as my hon. Friend believes it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows some of my reservations about vehicles of all kinds which plunge around our oceans. He listened attentively to what I said when I caught Mr. Speaker's eye in the Chamber earlier this week on the subject of pollution at sea from oil. The Minister is right to drawn our attention to the vast growth in the demand for hovercraft transport. I use it frequently going backwards and forwards to the Council of Europe. I know how efficient and how noisy it is. You will not be surprised, Mr. Wells, as you come from a constituency in Kent, to know that one of your constituents was a stewardess on the craft on which I was travelling recently and she asked me whether I was duty free. That might come under the terms of the carriage of dangerous goods. I am not sure, but no doubt the Clerks would know the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without doubt, the hovercraft is a brilliant British invention and one that should be encouraged in every way that we can do so. If this kind of legislation is an encouragement, then we should support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that we tend to be binding up hovercraft with more and more controls. If simplification could be achieved, it would be a good thing. Many Ministries are involved in hovercraft operations—the Department of Trade,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the Department of Industry and the Ministry of Defence, let alone the Civil Aviation Authority, in another role, and that Civil Aviation Authority is itself responsible to the Department of Trade. So there is a need for the tidying up that my hon. Friend recommends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the hovercraft is defined in the 1968 Act as a vehicle in its own right. I am very worried about any vehicle which carries dangerous loads across the Channel. Having a coastal constituency, I can watch the 2,000 vessels that plough up and down the world's busiest seaway every 24 hours. Hovercraft operate safely—let it be said— but directly across this mass of traffic. They operate at relatively high speeds compared with the other traffic. We want to be sure, if these fast vehicles are to be safe, that they are not turned into high-speed missiles. The Minister will not be surprised, therefore, if I express concern about the need to consider how safe is safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a long time I have said that what we need in the Channel, in particular, is a positive sea navigation control system so that all vessels can travel only with permission from controllers on shore on either side of the Channel. There should be no problem about effecting this arrangement. We know that similar matters have been well looked after under the auspices of the Department of Trade and the Civil Aviation Authority over many years in terms of air traffic control. I would hope that the Minister would feel that he could comment on this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hovercraft is a vehicle in its own right. Therefore, when operating in these dangerous sea conditions one has to be concerned about the mix of traffic in which the hovercraft will travel, particularly if it is carrying so-called dangerous materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, one would hope that there would be a greater demand in this country for the transport across the Channel by hovercraft of such things as fruit, flowers and vegetables—which might interest you, Mr. Wells. This would be better than relying on less reliable forms of transport which plague our markets in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore look for the Minister's assurance that he is not only aware of the circumstances which I have described but will consider them. He may then gain my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the opportunity of putting two questions to the Minister before the order is agreed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question, in a sense, follows from what my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Warren) has just said. I refer to the basic regulations as envisaged for hovercraft and their relevance to safety at sea. In 1974 my constituency had the experience of a hovercraft sinking on our shores, and we had to leap into the water and rescue the then Leader of the Liberal Party and his followers. One might question the charity that prevailed on that occasion. However, it raised a question at that time of speed regulations for hovercraft, and when hovercraft should or should not be allowed to put to sea—a matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear whether the order as drafted relates directly to that kind of problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Hunt), leading for the Opposition, said that the broad scope of the legislation covering normal merchant shipping would not be relevant to hovercraft. I would appreciate the Minister's comments on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the question of noise has been mentioned. Will the Minister say to what extent the Department of the Environment has been involved in drafting the order? I share the view of many hon. Members that there are rarely consultations between the Department of Trade and the Department of the Environment on noise matters. The Minister will be well aware of this matter in a flying context. I should like to know whether the question of hovercraft noise has been expressly considered, and, if so, what other Departments have advised the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I came to this Committee with an open mind—probably because I did not know what the order was about. I have listened to the last three speeches, and I am convinced that there is a need for a new code for the hovercraft, as it is a unique form of transport which does not fly entirely in the air, on the sea or on the land. What confuses me a little, however, is that from what Opposition Members have said this morning, I should have thought they would have opposed the order, suggesting
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
its withdrawal and replacement by a code that applies specifically to the hovercraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to pursue that line, but I want to emphasise the need for a special code for the hovercraft, particularly as it will be used for many more functions in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.50 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the contributions we have had this morning have been interesting. They have been terse, which makes them even more interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Wirral (Mr. Hunt) for the constructive comments that he made and for the welcome that he gave to the order. He accepts, as I do, that the maritime community and the hovercraft industry are content to accept that hovercraft, although they are a species amongst themselves in a way, working in a maritime environment should be treated as ships. If there were any demand from the industry for a reappraisal of the matter, of course we should take that into account. In fact, there is no such demand, and it does not have to worry about complying with bureaucratic rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department is very ready to advise hovercraft operators on these matters. We do so frequently. If any hon. Members have evidence to suggest that there is genuine anxiety about that, of course we shall be very happy to meet the operators and see what can be done to allay their anxiety. But I hope that the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) and that which has been expressed by the Opposition will be allayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the second point, relating to the Blue Book, raised by the hon. Member for Wirral. It is not really a point in practice, although in theory it seems to have substance. In operational practice, it does not appear to have substance. It would be difficult to extract rules that would apply exclusively to hovercraft and say that other rules have no application at all. This is probably the safest way of proceeding. I shall certainly look at the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the prohibition which may be imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority in determining hover-worthiness is not really germane. The essence of the matter is not to determine the operational value of the caraft, which is the job of the CAA, but to determine the kind of cargo
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
that they carry. That is rather a different matter and it relates to the whole of the maritime environment in which hovercraft operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, this situation has not given rise to difficulties in the past and we do not anticipate that in the relatively near future the situation will change much. I know that the hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Warren) would like me to speculate about the future, under the next Labour Government, but I am not disposed to do that. What I can tell the Committee, however—this will corroborate what was said by the hon. Member for Wirral—is that it is not the practice for hovercraft to carry dangerous goods. They do not carry containerised goods. To some degree, though, they carry mail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of practice, the guidance and approval of the Department is sought before the operators engage in such practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The carriage of mail can be dangerous, as we all know, but it is not within the definition of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt essentially with the points raised by the hon. Member for Wirral. I now come to the comments made by the hon. Member for Hastings. The main point he made was to remind me with some force of what he has been saying for some time and what he said in the House of Commons the other day when, regrettably, because I had an enormous number of matters with which to deal, I could not answer his remarks. In any event, he was unavoidably unable to be present to listen to the winding-up speech.

The problem of controlling ships, including hovercraft—like that of aircraft —is not an easy matter, as the hon. Member tended to suggest. It is very different from controlling aircraft. Navigation of ships in two dimensions on the open sea is best conducted by the masters. The hon. Member may not agree with that, but let me advance the argument. Save in ports and port approaches, no shore-based centre is in a position to appreciate the navigational problem as well as can the properly qualified master with appropriate aids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However—I think that this may be of some solace to the hon. Member—we are developing our arrangements for supplying the master with the best possible informa-

tion from shore-based radar, where the range makes that possible. The hon. Member will know that the Channel navigational information service in the Dover Strait is an example of that and has made a marked contribution to safety in what are, perhaps, the most congested waters in the world. The extended trial of the Anglo-French reporting-in system in the Channel, which begins on 1st January, will take the service a further step forward. In addition, we are conducting trials of shore-based radar in the south-west of England and in Wales.

The hon. Member has very properly drawn attention to a point of substance— that hovercraft travel at comparatively great speed and cut across traffic separation schemes. It is right that the public should be aware of that. However, it is equally right to point out that hovercraft operators take the maximum care, and use highly trained crew in conducting those operations.

The hon. Member went on, I suspect irrelevantly, to talk about fruit, flowers and vegetables, which have, as far as I know, nothing to do with dangerous goods.

The hon. Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) has an admirable sense of obligation. He said that he felt an obligation to rescue the then Leader of the Liberal Party or people in his constituency, which I find interesting. The hon. Member asked about noise and about co-ordination between the Department of Trade and the Department of the Environment. I assure him that the degree of liaison at ministerial as well as official level is very high. When we were working on the airports policy review, we had clearly to have regard to considerations of noise, and the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment and I were closely involved throughout our consideration of that problem.

I think that that deals with the various points raised in the Committee. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North will agree that I did not omit to deal with his comment. I shall take note of what has been said, particularly about any need that may arise for a separate regime for hovercraft. It has not arisen yet, but if there were a demand from the operators to be segregated—not segregated from the essential requirement of treating them within a maritime environment, but for them to have a separate
