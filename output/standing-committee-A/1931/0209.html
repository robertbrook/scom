â€”(Scope of planning schemes.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Sir HENRY CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the consideration of the Clause be postponed."<br><br>
I make this technical Motion with a view to eliciting the Minister's views as to the conduct of these proceedings, and also with a view to getting a reply to some questions that I wish to put to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order! We do not allow smoking in these Committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the first place, I desire to enter a protest against the way in which this Bill is being rushed. The Second Reading of the Bill, which has some 58 pages, took place only on Tuesday last, and the Committee was set up on Thursday. Many Members did not receive notice of it till Saturday morning. The House of Commons, I believe I am right in saying, is composed as to no less than 75 per cent. of new Members, and it is quite impossible for such Members to read and understand this Bill and to take counsel with their friends or with those who are interested in the Measure so as to put down Amendments; and further, as to such Amendments as have been put down, nobody in this room has had the opportunity of reading them until this morning. I should like to ask what is the reason of this haste.<br><br>
My interest in this far-reaching Measure is that a number of my constituents have asked me to interest myself in it because they are very much alarmed as to the scope of the Bill and as to where it is going to lead. I am not going to say much about the Bill now, but as far as I understand it, it deals with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
the whole of the land and buildings of England, Scotland, and Wales, and it removes the control from those who have hitherto had control of the development and puts it in the hands of local authorities as to whose fitness to be entrusted with such large powers very many people have the gravest apprehensions. Further, a number of persons with whom I have been in communication regard the Bill as placing a dead hand over the land, buildings, and development, which is extremely undesirable. Therefore, I enter this protest for my own part, and I would ask the Minister what is the reason for this haste and why he is so pressing it forward.<br><br>
In the next place, I would like to ask him to do this: Most of us do not know the terms of the Bill that was under consideration in the last Parliament under the Socialist Government, and it would be a great convenience and would very much expedite the consideration of the points that will come before this Committee if the right hon. Gentleman could see his way to having a copy of the Bill prepared, showing which are the parts of the old Bill and which are the new parts. I do not anticipate that that would cause any very great expense or trouble to the officers of the Department promoting the Bill. My last point is to ask whether, during the course of the hearing before this Committee, the right hon. Gentleman will be in a position, or will put himself in a position, to give us some estimate of the cost that will be imposed on all the local authorities in the country by the passage of this Bill. I am informedâ€”and I believe it to be the factâ€”that it will require the appointment of a separate town planning officer on every local authority, and in the majority of cases of a considerable staff to carry out the details of the Measure; and it is not to be forgotten that if the local authorities themselves think it undesirable to proceed with it, or to do so with energy and zeal, the Minister himself has power to take it upon himself to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. M. W. BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I wish to add a few words to the observations of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley). I had intended to raise a discussion of this nature on the first Amendment on the Paper,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0005">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
but I think it will probably be for the convenience of the Committee to take that discussion now, and I should like to ask the Minister to state as clearly as he can what are his intentions with regard to the conduct of this Bill. This is not a non-controversial Bill, but a Bill to which there is considerable opposition and one which some of us would gladly see dead and certainly must be unwilling to see on the Statute Book unless it is very radically amended. On the other hand, we are all busy people and do not like sitting in this Committee room morning after morning for weeks on end, and it is not our intention to offer that rather factious opposition which it might be possible to put forward if the Government conducting the Measure were one in which we had not the utmost confidence; but I am bound to confess that we are not encouraged in that attitude by what my hon. and learned Friend has referred to as the hurrying on of the Bill.<br><br>
If I may say so without offence, I think it was fortunate for the Minister that the Bill got its Second Reading on the first day after the adjournment of the Session. My hon. and learned Friend has mentioned the difficulty which many of us, and particularly the new Members, have in understanding, until we get practice, Bills and Amendments thereto, and I doubt if this Bill would have had the pleasant passage on Second Reading Which it did in fact get, had there been more time for Members to discuss it and realise its provisions fully. On the top of that, the Bill is brought into Committee a week after its passage on Second Reading. I speak subject to correction as a Parliamentary two-year-old, but I do not think it is customary to be quite so quick, and certainly the Socialist Government never, among their many crimes, hurried us quite so much as this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTRY of HEALTH (Mr. Ernest Brown)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Action!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the force of the hon. Member's comment. On the other hand, if the cry of "Action" is to be such that the opposition to this or any other Bill are not to be given adequate time to consider their Amendments and their position, I think the action may well end in delaying rather than expediting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Measures. I wish to join in my hon. and learned Friend's protest. I know, for instance, that one of the keenest Members of this Committee, one who has taken a leading part on all the previous stages of this Bill, my Noble Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Marquess of Hartington) went to Ireland with no idea that this Bill would be coming on so soon. I only discovered it on Friday morning, and managed, by hard work over the week-end, to obtain consideration of the first Clause, but the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will see, by the small number of Amendments on the Paper on Clause 1, how inadequately our work has been done, and I hope the Minister will not try to rush this Bill through without giving us a chance to voice our objections or to consider the matter carefully.<br><br>
It is true that this Bill, or one very much like it, has been through a Committee of this House already, but very few of the Members of this Committee were also on that Committeeâ€”and the House has changed, most of us, I think, will agree, very much for the better since that timeâ€”and they must have time to consider this Measure anew. On the Committee stage of the last Bill the present Attorney-General said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the friendliest possible spirit towards this Bill, I would express the hope that the Minister will not, from the beginning, adopt the attitude that the drafting of this Bill, which is a difficult one, came down from the Mount, and cannot be improved."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee D</i>), 28th April, 1931; col. 621.]</p></blockquote>
That is our attitude. There are certain salient points on which we consider that this Bill is intolerable. If we know that we shall be met in a friendly spirit and that the Minister will try to get as nearly as possible an agreed Bill, it will be very much easier for all of us to cut these discussions and get, at the end of a short Committee stage, I will not say a good Bill, because I do not think anything embodying the principle in this Bill could be good, but 'a very much better Bill than the one now before us, a very much improved Bill, by general consent; and the Minister will get on to the Statute Book what I know is very dear to his heart with very mach less trouble and much more quickly than if we have to fight and discuss at length every point of substance which we feel it right to bring forward. I make these observations in the hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0006">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
that the Minister will make a statement on these points, so that we shall know exactly where we are and what his intentions are; and we can then progress with reasonable celerity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HURD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I am very much in harmony with much that my hon. Friends feel, I do not think it ought to go out from this Committee that this Bill is being rushed through Parliament in a very indecorous fashion. I sat for many weeks on the Standing Committee that considered this Bill in great detail and went into every aspect of it, and we have had two elaborate discussions on the Floor of the House. We have also had the Measure discussed in the public Press and in various public bodies all through the country. There is a universal feeling that we are getting into a horrible mess, and it is urgently necessary that something should be done to establish some degree of orderliness. Anybody who would suggest that my right hon. Friend the present Minister of Health is rushing pell-mell upon this question without the fullest details is showing an ignorance of my right hon. Friend and his methods. I do not see anything hurried and precipitate in the way this Bill has been brought forward. The call for it is urgent, and the sooner we get on with it the better it will be for the public generally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The MINISTER of HEALTH (Sir Hilton Young)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cordially welcome the observations of the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley) and the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. M. W. Beaumont), because I think they will assist us in clearing up matters at the outset of the discussions on this Bill. The hon, and learned Member for East Grinstead mentioned one point on which we can assist him to an understanding of this Bill, and that was by showing him the particulars in which the present Measure differs from the previous Bill. That is a most reasonable request, with which I will comply in whatever is the most convenient way. I am not sure which will be the most convenient way, because the differences are very slight. I explained on Second Reading that the only differences between this Bill and the Bill which was threshed out in the last Parliament are that on this occasion we have inserted all those accommodations and arrangements which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
were arrived at in Committee on the previous Bill. On one matter, dealing with betterment, we have been able very much to simplify the Bill in a manner which should commend itself to hon. Members. However, I will arrange to have the information provided in whatever is the clearest and most convenient form.<br><br>
On another point he raised, I will give him the best information I can when we come to the relevant point in our proceedingsâ€”will give him whatever guess we can make at the cost which may be thrown upon local authorities. He will understand that the information can only be by way of estimate. I think his fears that it will cast any considerable cost upon local authorities in relation to the actual work done will not be realised. If I understood him aright, the hon. Member for Aylesbury asked me in what spirit the opposition to this Bill which he has demonstrated is to be met in this Committee. Let me hasten to say I hope it will be met in a spirit of accommodation and reasonableness. I welcome, in particular, as likely to save our time here, what he said as to the difference between what may be called general opposition and criticism of points of acknowledged difficulty directed towards amending the Bill in specific particulars. I freely recognise that this is a difficult and anxious province of administration, and that we are feeling our way towards the best solution of certain very difficult problems, and on certain matters which are clearly in the minds of my hon. Friends opposite, I shall be eager to welcome any constructive suggestions which will improve the working of the Measure or introduce safeguards for the protection of this or that public interest.<br><br>
Our proceedings will be conducted in a spirit of reasoned accommodation, And by no means in a spirit of antagonism, but I believe we can save very much time by concentrating discussion upon what are known to be the difficult parts of the Bill, and not allowing it to range too widely over principles which were established on Second Reading. Some criticism has been advanced on the grounds of haste. I do not think that is quite justified, and in that I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Hurd). It is quite normal for the first Bill which obtains a Second Reading
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0007">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
in the House to come upstairs to Committee straight away. That is necessary in order to avoid wasting the time of hon. Members, and, what is more important, wasting valuable Parliamentary time. If the first Bill is put off it may prejudice the chances of some useful Measure towards the end of the Session. It is only the circumstance that this happens to be the first Bill which produces the impression of haste. When the hon. Member was speaking I considered whether there was any substantial inconvenience to hon. Members, in the fact that our proceedings began this morning, and I do not really think there is, because the Clause we shall be discussing this morning, the first Clause, is really nothing more than the general principle of the Bill, and speeches on it must be rather of a general and Second Reading character. The Clause does not raise any difficult technical matters such as would require consideration and the consultation of other Statutes.<br><br>
Therefore, I do not think we are doing anything unusual or placing any inconvenience on hon. Members in asking them to save their own time and Parliamentary time by continuing the discussion of Clause 1 this morning. I hope that with this explanation of the assistance which we shall be able to give, and the spirit in which all constructive criticism will be met, and of the circumstances under which we meet, the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead will see his way to withdraw his Motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General CLIFTON BROWN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Though not wishing to obstruct, I support the protest that this Bill has been very much rushed. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Hurd) to say that a similar Measure has been considered in Committee several times, but I and several others were not on that Committee. It is a new Bill to us and raises important and contentious subjects. We of The Central Landowners Association got only a week's notice of it. I wrote to the Minister to ask if he could issue a White Paper showing the difference between this Bill and the Bill of 1931. He said there was not much difference, and he did not think it worth while to issue a White Paper, but he kindly gave us information generally as to the differences. It was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
only a week, however, before the Second Reading. We were not in the least inclined to oppose the Second Reading, because we recognise the importance of getting some Measure to deal with the countryside, but it was only on Monday night that I heard incidentally that the Committee was to meet to-day, and our meeting to consider Amendmentsâ€”perfectly friendly Amendmentsâ€”had been called for to-morrow. We never thought the Bill would be rushed throughâ€”at any rate that is the impression we get, though I am sure it is wrongâ€”before the people are alive to the very difficult problems which are raised by it. I am sure the Minister does not want to rush it and will not do so. We are all very grateful for the very sincere tribute which my hon. Friend paid to the late hon. and gallant Member for Henley (Captain Henderson), who was our representative all through the proceedings on the similar Bill last year. He put forward many helpful criticisms, and we hope to follow on those lines, but I do not conceal from the Minister that there are certain parts of the Bill on which serious attention must be concentrated. I see that no Law Officer of the Crown is present this morning, and no doubt it is not necessary for him to attend for Clause 1, but I hope that when we come to the contentious Clauses a Law Officer will be present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Attorney-General will be here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General CLIFTON BROWN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will not give the impression to any who are vitally interested in this matter that he wants to rush this important Bill through the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee are most grateful for the words of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health. We know how sincerely he is interested in town and country planning and that he is anxious to pass a Bill on the subject, and we on our part are not out to make its passage more difficult or more tedious than need be. I myself have not the least desire to sit here for 21 long days discussing these Clauses. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary dropped in the word "action" when my hon. Friend was speaking. I would remind him that we are a dynamic Parliament and I hope we have a dynamic Government, but one of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
the first principles of dynamics is that every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. I hope the reaction in this case will be equal, but that it will not be opposite to the desires of my right hon. Friend. He spoke of the accommodations and arrangements made in Committee, six months ago, but I hope he will not assume that those arrangements were accommodations from our point of view. We were then moving Amendments under a Socialist Government and had to get the best terms we could and look as cheerful as we might, but none of us came away from that Committee feeling that we had got all that was either fair or necessary. At this stage of the proceedings last year Mr. Greenwood, the then Minister of Health, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that I shall desire, and I think I may say that any successor of mine will desire, to work the Act fairly and in the closest co-operation with the local authorities. I do not anticipate local authorities driving the Act so hard as to injure legitimate private interests."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee D</i>), 28th April, 1931; col. 611.]</p></blockquote>
Those words indicate a very marked difference of attitude between Mr. Greenwood and ourselves. He based his speech on hopes; in this Bill we want to base ourselves on the certainty that when the Bill leaves us the Minister cannot unduly interfere with local authorities, and the certainty that neither local authorities nor the Minister can unduly interfere with the private rights and interests of subjects in this country. I do not desire to delay our getting down to business, but I am sure my hon. Friend did not notice the presence of one Law Officer or he would not have made the remarks he did. We hope that the Attorney-General, who took a rational and constitutional view in the discussions on the previous Measure, will honour our proceedings by his presence here from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will agree with the proposal for some postponement of the consideration of this Measure. There are many new Members who think that rather indecent haste has been shown in again submitting to this House a derelict Measure of the late Socialist Government, which the present Government happened to find when they came into office. It may well be that there are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
very few differences between this Measure and the relic which they found, but that does not make it any more acceptable. It is a new Bill to Members of this Parliament, and the fact that a similar Measure received a good deal of consideration under totally different circumstances does not in the least commend this Bill to our favourable consideration. Circumstances have changed considerably. The Minister in a very conciliatory explanation indicated that he would proceed on the lines of endeavouring to obtain reasoned accommodations to which all would subscribe. But he seemed to be unduly impressed with the question of cost to local authorities. I know that that is a matter which impresses his Department very much. But the cost to the Government or to the local authorities will not concern the whole of us so much as the deadly, ghastly, cost to the whole country which the prohibitive and restrictive nature of this Measure will involve. That is what concerns many of us and we would like a little more time for the consideration of the matter from that point of view. No possible harm could come from a postponement for the purpose of enabling this Measure, in all its implications, to be better understood.<br><br>
It is not as though there were no powers already available for dealing with this question. Ample powers already exist. No one is gasping at the present time for additional powers. There are plenty of provisions already which local authorities can get along with and there is certainly no clamant demand from local authorities or indeed from anyone for this Measure. Local authorities have as much as they can manage in the existing powers. Powers of this kind have indeed existed for the last 22 years, and I suggest to the Minister that if he left this matter alone and did not interfere, and did not keep on whipping up the local authorities to clamour for further powers, the local authorities would go along peacefully, quietly and successfully dealing with the enormous amount of town planning which the present provisions enable them to deal with.<br><br>
It is to be remembered that after the local authorities had had these powers for about 16 years, so little demand was there for additional powers, that additional powers had to be placed upon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
them, not by way of option, but as compulsory powers. It was found necessary to compel local authorities to prepare town planning schemes in respect of boroughs with a population of over 20,000. They did not want the powers. If the Ministry would take its whips off the backs of the local authorities, and leave those authorities alone and allow them to digest the enormous meal of legislation, already given to them, the net result to the public would be very much better. I think that this derelict Measure of the late Socialist Government might be left over for the purpose of having its provisions better explained to the public, and for the purpose of investigating whether there is any demand from any quarter whatever for such a Measure. I hope that the Minister will agree to postponing the further consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I much appreciate what the Minister said, especially about my second and third points. I do not think that he quite answered the point about hurrying on the matter, but as it would only be a matter of two days I do not propose to carry it any further. I ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</span></p>
<p>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, after the word "scheme," to insert the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"enabling a local authority or a county council or a joint committee constituted for the purposes of this Act to prohibit or restrict the use of land for building purposes."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is intended to indicate the real object of the Bill. As, I understand it, the Bill seeks to make an appeal upon the basis that there are no financial difficulties or encumbrances involved in connection with it. According to the Preamble, it is a Bill to "facilitate" certain things. It is described as a Bill
<br><blockquote><p>"to provide for the protection of rural amenities and the preservation of buildings and other objects of interest or beauty."</p></blockquote>
These are most desirable objects, and if they were not placed in the forefront of the Bill, it would get practically no support. These matters are placed in the forefront in order to convey the impression that they represent the main object of the Bill. But this Preamble is merely a smoke-semen behind which all sorts of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
operations are to take place. If the objects which I have quoted were all that the Bill was to provide for, I do not think that there would be any opposition to it from any quarter. So truly do the people of this country love the amenities of the country, that they would accept almost any Measure which would effectively and efficiently provide for the maintenance of those amenities. But when we proceed further we find that the Bill is also "for charging on owners of property expenditure on improvements." It certainly makes ample provision for those charges. Later, it is indicated that another of its objects is "to facilitate the acquisition of land for garden cities."<br><br>
Reading that one would not think that there was anything particularly objectionable in the Bill. One might imagine that it was for the purpose of enabling garden cities to obtain land in circumstances in which at present they were unable to do so. That is an entirely wrong impression. Powers already exist for that purpose. The charging on owners of property of expenditure on improvements would be all right, provided that the alterations made were improvements, and provided that the benefits of such improvements accrued before the charges were made. There is no word in the Preamble to suggest that this is really a Bill to give powers of a restrictive and prohibitive nature in respect of the whole of the built-up areas of the country. Yet that is the real and primary intention of the Bill. That is the greatest change which the Bill proposes. In moving this Amendment I submit that that intention should appear early in Clause 1, so that those who read the Bill shall not receive the verbiage of this Clause as a sort of soporific and so that they shall not be led to believe that this is just a nice, friendly, genial Measure for the purpose of facilitating progress. That it is nothing of the kind is revealed by Clause 12 where hon. Members will find the provisions which town planning schemes will contain with respect to buildings and building operations.<br><br>
These provisions are all of a limiting, restrictive and prohibitive nature. There is no provision anywhere for facilitating or assisting. Everything is controlling and prohibiting. There are prohibitions, restrictions and limitations imposed upon prohibiting and restricting local autho-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
rities by a prohibiting and restricting Ministry of Health. That is the atmosphere which pervades the whole Bill. It seems to be designed for the purpose of preventing anyone getting on with anything unless he goes through a whole lot of worry and trouble and incurs irritating expense and inconvenience. The real intention of the Bill being as I have described it, I think it is just as well that that intention should be placed in the forefront of the Measure so that we may know the sort of proposal with which we are dealing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment was put down mainly for the purpose of getting a declaration from the Minister as to whether or not be agrees, first, that local authorities have at present adequate powers to develop on what lines they like, and, secondly, that this whole Bill is therefore merely one to restrict and prohibit. We do not propose to proceed to a Division on these proposed words, but it the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary would say to the Committee that they realise that that is the position and that the object of the Bill is as I have indicated, it would clarify the situation materially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members place me in a position of considerable embarrassment. On an Amendment to which I should like to confine myself strictly, according to the Rules of Order, they invite me to make a fresh Second Reading speech. I do not consider that the powers now vested in local authorities are adequate for the performance of the essential work which they desire to perform, and which the country desires them to perform. If we thought so, the Bill would not be necessary. But I must address myself to the actual Amendment. I wish, in every detail, to meet any constructive suggestions which are made. I have given careful consideration to this Amendment to see whether we could find in it any constructive improvement of the Bill. I am afraid we cannot. I am afraid that the words proposed- here would not assist either in general or in particular. First, the definition of local authority is too vague. It might, for instance, include the county council which is referred to afterwards. Secondly, the introduction of the reference to the county council here, would lead inevitably to confusion and conflict of jurisdiction.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
We have done our best to meet a certain line of opinion on administration in this matter, by giving special power to the county council later on in this Bill, and that would be the most appropriate point for the discussion of the matter.<br><br>
Finally, as to the limitation of the activities to building purposes, that, I am afraid, would very seriously limit the useful powers, which are indeed at present possessed by local authorities, and which, on the whole, we desire moderately to extend rather than further to limit. It would limit activities to building powers, and it would, for instance, cut out all power of dealing with our old enemy the refuse tip. We do not want to do that. That is a case in which we want to move to a higher standard rather than to go backwards. If it is desired to remove any restrictions on purposes for which the schemes can be made, it is really in a later part of the Bill, in Clause 11, that we can more relevantly deal with it than under this Clause, which is merely a general principle Clause. In these circumstances, I hope that my hon. Friends will see their way to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with what the Minister has to say about the last part of the Amendment. Would he mind pointing out in what other way, except in regard to the refuse tip, these words are inaccurate? It has been suggested that the words, "to prohibit or restrict the use of land for building purposes" is a fair definition of the object of the Bill. If it is limited to that, I see no objection to the words being inserted, although I do not think that they are necessary. I was not aware however, that the object of the Bill was so confined as that. If the Minister can tell the Committee in what other way it has not a restricted or prohibited purpose, it would be a great advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also was disappointed with the speech of the Minister. He is probably the better judge than I am whether these are the best words for the purpose for which they are intended, but I have no doubt that if these words were inserted, my hon. Friends would be, prepared to remove the words "a county council" in order to make the definition of "local authority" clear. We feel strongly that there is considerable need for a closer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
limiting definition of what these authorities are to have the power to do. I cannot put it better than by once again quoting the admirable speech of the present Attorney-General in Committee on a somewhat similar Amendment on 28th April last. I wish he were here now to reinforce it to-day. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am a little suspicious of the idea implied in the words used in the Bill for securing the proper development of the land if they suggest that the local authorities, in preparing schemes, are to consider the meticulous and intensive control of the use of the land by the owners."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the intention of this Bill is to enable local authorities, and the Minister, with his very remarkable over-riding powers which I hope will be cut down to a great extent"â€”</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister and the Attorney-General will bear that in mind when we come to this portion of the Billâ€”
<br><blockquote><p>"to control every use which a private owner may make of his land, the Bill will certainly not be received in the friendly spirit in which it is treated at the present time."</p></blockquote>
The Minister on the Second Reading, in dealing with certain Clauses to which exception was, has been, and will be taken, said very definitely that if such a thing is put forward as an objection to these Clauses, that is not the way in which they will be used. We want it to be laid down clearly from the beginning what are the limiting powers beyond which the local authorities and the Minister cannot go. While we have a limited trust in the present Minister, and a very limited trust in the local authoritiesâ€”and this is born of my experience of them â€”we have no trust in the unknown Ministers and local authorities who may come in future. We, therefore, want to have laid down .the point beyond which none of them are able to go in controlling our property. In the speech which I have quoted, the Attorney-General again said:
<br><blockquote><p>"You must not, as the Noble Lord the Member for West Derbyshire (Marquess of Hartington) pointed out on the Second reading, protect rural amenities by preventing individuals, even if they do own a quarter of an acre of land, from building a home for themselves in a beautiful situation. That would be an intolerable burden."â€” [OFFICAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee D</i>), 28th April, 1932; cols. 621â€“3.]</p></blockquote>
We feel that all through this Bill the wording of the powers and intentions are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
too wide, and we want definitely to restrict the words so that the powers shall not be developed beyond a point which is right, just and equitable. I do not suppose that my hon. Friend looks with any particular affection on these particular words, and I am sure that he would be prepared to consider alternatives. We think, however, that something ought to be inserted to lay down from the beginning a limitation on the activities of the bodies which are to prepare these schemes. We hope that if the Amendment is withdrawn, the Minister will, between now and the Report stage, give serious consideration to inserting words to meet us on this point.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 8, to leave out the word "land," and to insert instead thereof the word "places."<br><br>
I am sorry that my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Louth (Lieut.-Colonel Heneage) is not here to move this Amendment; I hope that he will come back in time to make the interesting observations which I know he has to make. This Amendment has to be taken in conjunction with a later Amendment in page 1, line 10, after the word "land," to insert the words, "Sea coast or sea up to the international limit." The object is to make clear that the sea-shore is included in the places where the amenities are to be safeguarded. I have not the expert knowledge or the complete facts which the hon. and gallant Gentleman has, but I understand that on the coast of Lincolnshire in his constituency, the Air Force are taking a large portion of the sea coast for bombing practice and thus destroying the amenities for those who, in the words of the old song, "do like to be beside the sea-side," and will not be able in the evenings to take their pleasure on the sands as they were wont to do. This matter may already be covered in the Bill. Clause 42 deals with it in some way. I do not suggest that it should be within the powers of the local authorities in any way to interfere with the activities of the Royal Air Force, but it is felt that if we are to have these beneficial or malevolent activities on land and on land covered by water, there is no adequate reason why the sea shore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
should be exempt. It is to make clear that it is not exempt that I move the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely sympathise with the object of this Amendment, which is for the definition of the powers which the Bill proposes to confer, but the hon. Member is quite right; we have to have regard to Clause 42, which reserves the powers of the Board of Trade to speak its mind on questions affecting the foreshore. That, of course, is in order that no obstacles are placed in the way of trade, navigation and shipping, and it is necessary to bring in the Board of Trade as the authority responsible for those interestsâ€”a reasonable provision. Then there is power to plan the foreshore. I do not think that there is any practicable meaning in power to plan out as far as the three-mile limit, but as regards planning out to low watermark on the foreshore, I am advised that the words in the Bill are appropriate and sufficient. It is not necessary to make the alteration suggested by the Amendment for that purpose. In these circumstances, as we are really securing the purpose which the hon. Member desires to secure, the Amendment is not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend for moving the Amendment, and I apologise for not being here to do it. The point, I think, is very likely met to this extent, that there are powers to take in the sea shore in town planning schemes. Are there also powers to do two things up to the three-mile limit? One is to prevent anybody building piers or unsightly objects into the sea. The second thing is one about which I have considerable difficulty. On the north coast of Lincolnshire are the most beautiful sands you can find in England. They are the playing ground of the Midland industrial regions. To reach the sands you pass through beautiful unspoiled country, so that you have there the two amenities of beautiful drives through lovely country and marvellous sands where the children can play when you arrive there. The Lindsay County Council have done their best to take powers to preserve the amenities by the Lincolnshire Sandhills Bill. That is a private Bill, which has stuck. There is first the desire of the Midlands to have access to the shore which lies between
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
Cleethorpes and Mablethorpe, a stretch of 20 miles. There has, however, been the difficulty of certain squatters on the land, which are being satisfactorily met.<br><br>
There is another difficulty, which presents an almost insurmountable problem. On account of the nature of the sands and the absence of sea traffic outside them, they form, from the Air Force point of view, one of the places where bombing can be allowed, and the Air Force proposes to take possession of the whole of the stretch of these sands and to exclude the public from them even in Bank Holiday week. I shall have publicly to call the Minister's attention to the danger of this action to the amenities of the district. Nobody recognises more than I do the needs of the defence Forces, but you have long stretches of uninhabited coast in Scotland, so that anybody, for instance, could drop a bomb on them and nobody know that it had gone off. At the same time, there is the danger of excluding from one of the playgrounds of the Midlands, which is fairly convenient to them, one of the most marvellous stretches of sand, and it shows the necessity of this kind of Bill and that care must be taken to see that, while necessary land is allocated to the Air Force, it shall not be land which is one of the few stretches to which the Midlands can get access.<br><br>
While there is no reason why they should not continue to use the mud flats which they do use at present, their wish to extend into the Mablethorpe town planning area over wonderful sands all the year round is a considerable danger to the livelihood of the people of the neighbourhood. The farmers and smallholders eke out these very difficult times by taking in people as country boarders during the holiday period, and this source of income may be completely shut out. While the country districts as a whole would welcome the Air Force there, not only because they like to see them, but also perhaps as a source of income, at the same time there is this amenity question, which I beg the Minister to keep very seriously before him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply interested in what the hon. and gallant Member for Louth (Lieut.-Colonel Heneage) has said. He is evidently very particular about preserving his own doorstep, but he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
wants to drive these folk to Scotland. We have at the present time a "Come to Scotland" campaign, but it is not bombing machines and aeroplanes that we want. We want the places that are not inhabited, as the hon. and gallant Member says, to be inhabited. We have a wild enough name in Scotland without getting more of this thrown at us. I think the Clause as it stands, with the word "land," is quite sufficient, and I am not supporting the Amendment at all. I think we have ample scope in this Clause as it stands to deal town planning properly. I have been deeply interested in what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Sir J. Walker Smith), as to there being no demand for this Bill. From my experience of local authorities over the last 20 years, I should say that there is a great demand for the Bill and for this Clause as it stands, giving a controlling power to the local authorities to town plan, and there is a bigger demand still for the controlling hand of the Minister to help in controlling the local authorities. While making my mild protest against coming to Scotland with aeroplanes, I support the Clause as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Louth (Lieut.-Colonel Heneage) that his point will be noted, but he will see that his Amendment is really one illustration of the real demand that there is for the powers contained in this Bill. I can only reply to him by saying that the best way to get the powers for Mablethorpe is to pass the Bill into law as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 8, after the word "land," to insert the words "to which this Act applies."<br><br>
I wish also to be taken into consideration an Amendment on the next page, in line 2, at the end, to add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that this Act shall not apply to any land on which there are existing buildings other than buildings used for agriculture unless a resolution adopting this Act for the purpose of controlling the development of the said lands shall have been passed by an absolute majority of two-thirds of the members of the local authority of the

district in which the lands are situated, at a meeting or meetings specially summoned for the purpose after not less than ten days' notice thereof published in a newspaper circulating in the district stating the specific object or objects for which a scheme is required and defining the lands to which it is to be applied."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for the Cathcart Division (Mr. Train) referred to the word "land" as being satisfactory to him, but as it applies in this Bill it has far too wide a meaning and is far too sweeping. I too, like the hon. Member, have had experience of local authorities, and I have found that words which have such a wide interpretation are extremely dangerous. I feel, therefore, that we should have some safeguard by having the word amplified and defined. Some local authorities, including the one of which I was chairman, use considerable discretion, but I know of local authorities which have done just the reverse, and I think it is too dangerous to leave in the hands cf such local authorities a Measure containing words which have such a wide interpretation, and I demand that some safeguard be provided.<br><br>
The object of the second of my two Amendments is to endeavour to establish a safeguard. It must surely appeal to the Minister of Health that this is quite a reasonable Amendment in so far as we say "Yes, give the power to the local authorities," but while giving them that power we are not surely asking too much when we say that they shall notify to landowners and ratepayers generally that they intend taking a certain course, particularly in so far as the built-up areas are concerned. I feel that if we have a condition that publicity should be given, so that the ratepayers shall know what is likely to take place, we are not asking too much. To have a special meeting of the council, followed by publicity, and with a definite majority, would, I consider, be reasonable safeguards for all concerned.<br><br>
There is another point which is very important. You are giving the local authorities a power which may be quite innocently used, but which may result in their being saddled with very heavy claims for compensation. With this power undefined, it may be that some local authority will pass a resolution embracing a very large area on which they have no intention immediately of carry-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
ing out any town planning scheme, but the effect of passing that resolution places the landowner in the position that if he proceeds with any development, he does so at his own risk. If he should do so, or the local authority should at some future time change their view, thus placing the ratepayers in the position that they may have to suffer very considerable claims for compensation, I feel that my suggested alterations are really necessary in the interests of the Bill. Neither of them shows any indication that we are wanting to create obstruction. We are trying to help the Bill. Those who have had experience with previous Measures have suffered great injustices, and therefore we are here for the definite purpose of endeavouring to make this Bill more workable and more palatable to all parties concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MOREING</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be very brief in supporting my hon. Friend's Amendments, but I feel strongly on the point dealt with. As one reads and studies this Bill more and more, one sees that in the eyes of the Ministry of Health a local authority becomes some sort of super-being, endowed with miraculous powers of judgment, of taste, and of ability to deal with complicated questions. Like yourself, Sir Cyril, I have been a member of a local authority for a good many years, as, I suppose, have most hon. Members of this Committee, and I do not think we could say that our experience of local authorities necessarily shows that those bodies have all the qualities that are ascribed to them by the Ministry. When you take the smaller urban or rural district councilsâ€”I do not wish to be discourteous to the ladies and gentlemen who serve on them and do a tremendous amount of work for the public good, absolutely without remuneration and very often at considerable difficulty and expense to themselvesâ€”they are inclined sometimes to listen to the advice of their permanent officials, prepare a scheme rather hurriedlyâ€”there may be a few enthusiasts on the councilâ€”and, before you know what has happened, a scheme has been drawn up for a considerable part of the surrounding locality, which may affect a large number of landowners, and the scheme may not in any way be a really practical scheme.<br><br>
I have seen cases occurring in regard to land with which I am myself connected,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
where the local urban district council proposed a town planning scheme which was sent up to the Ministry of Health, and among other things proposed to drive a road through some really good farm land which would only shorten the distance traversed by the road by a comparatively small amount, and then they were going to schedule for building an area which was an absolute swamp and entirely unsuited for building land at all. That scheme had been drawn up by the local authority under the advice of a town planning expert, and it was carried through and adopted by the local authority in such a manner that a large number of the people concerned had no opportunity of stating their views or in fact of knowing anything about it till the scheme had been drawn up. If hon. Members will look at the proviso which it is suggested should be added at the end of Clause 1, they will see that we are not asking for very much, but that we are asking, in the interests of the ratepayers and the people in the locality generallyâ€”</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HURD</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member realise that these people would be consulted under the Bill as it stands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MOREING</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in certain circumstances, but I want to see that the thing is advertised as much as possible and that people get a chance of getting to the meeting. The Amendment states that there should be an advertisement of a proposed meeting and that it should be published in advance, that there should be a special meeting of the local authority, and that a majority of two-thirds of the council should support the resolution. I do not think it is asking very much to have that proviso put into the Clause. My friends and I put this Amendment forward in no spirit of hostility, but now that this subject of town and country planning is to be placed on a sound basis, we are anxious to see that everybody's interests are consulted and the pockets of the ratepayers considered. We should make certain that the ratepayers are not rushed into large schemes of expenditure by the enthusiasm of a few members of a council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the spirit in which this Amendment has been moved, and am confident that I shall be able to satisfy hon. Members that it is really not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
a necessary step in town planning procedure. Perhaps it has not been sufficiently realised that the adoption of this Amendment would mean a limitation of powers which have existed for a (long time. This special limitation about majorities and notices has never existed under town planning procedure hitherto. I would impress upon the Committee that the present Bill makes no very wide extension of existing powers. It is true there is some extension of the area over which powers can be exercised, but it is not nearly as great an extension as one might suppose. The Bill appears to extend for the first time these town planning powers to developed and agricultural land, but, under the existing law, there are substantial powers for extending a plan to all land already developed or not likely to be developed that might be included as a general object of the scheme. So there is a very slight extension of the power in the present Bill.<br><br>
Secondly, the fact is sometimes lost sight of that schemes of a limited character may be made under the present law for an area which has special architectural, historical or artistic interests, in order to preserve the characteristics of that area. I point out these two circumstances in order to show hon. Members that their Amendment would have the effect not, as we hope, of making these powers more reasonably exercise-able, but of actually limiting powers which already exist. On the substance of the matter I would say that I do not think it is a good thing to increase the number of procedures which have to be adopted by local authoritiesâ€”these special majorities and special notices. It is resisted by local authorities, and I think reasonably, on the ground that all their duties are very responsible duties, and it ought not to be supposed that some are more responsible than others and require more attention. They ought to give the same degree of close attention to all their duties. On general grounds one feels a disposition against increasing the number of procedures in which special majorities and special notices are required.<br><br>
If there is any procedure which secures complete publicity and notice to everybody concerned in a locality, it is this planning procedure. Under existing pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
cedure one cannot get a plan finally adopted without at least two public inquiries in the locality concerned and the ample notice to everybody which those inquiries must give. It is quite possible, indeed, to have more than two inquiries, and there is some complaint that the procedure is too cumbrous, and stands too much in the way of the exercise of the powers concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under which Clause are more than two inquiries provided for?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the hon. and learned Member in a moment. We do not mean to remove any of the present safeguards securing publicity, but I do not think there is any reasonable case for increasing them, and I hope that hon. Members will not press their Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Minister's remarks were concerned not so much with this Amendment as with the proviso that hinges on it. I suggest that these words have a very material value, and I do not think they would hurt the fabric of his Bill, but improve it. I speak subject to the advice of the Attorney-General, who is now here, but is it not a fact that where "land" was left unqualified all land not specifically excluded by subsequent enactments would be included, but that if these words are put in only that land would be included which is specially mentioned in subsequent Clauses? That is a very important distinction. We have certain Amendments later which seek to revert to the position under the Act of 1925. I hope that throughout the Bill the Minister will sympathetically meet our endeavours to exclude certain matters which are now included. If he could see his way to accept this Amendment, even though he cannot accept the other, it would be of material assistance to us, and would not hurt his Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must differ from the Minister in regard to the attitude he took up respecting the publicity procedure which the proviso seeks to impose on local authorities. He said, and it is quite true, that local authorities ought to pursue all sides of their work with equal care, but I suggest that the work to be discharged by local authorities falls into two distinct categories. In one case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
they are administering powers generally and in the other case they are interfering with the control of individuals over their own property. It may be beneficient controlâ€”that is his contentionâ€”but I am inclined to doubt it. The fact remains that this Bill allows them to interfere with a person's control of his own property, and I do not think there can be too many safeguards for due publicity and making it certain that the will of the ratepayers is adequately represented. My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Hurd) said that owners of property affected did have a certain measure of consultation, but a right to appeal to the Minister or the right to protest is very different from compelling local authorities definitely to consult their constituents before they adopt schemes and apply them to this type of land.<br><br>
The Minister is acting on the theory that all local authorities are up to the standard of the best local authorities. If that were so I should neither take exception to this Bill nor wish to amend it in this way. I do not know whether the Minister has experience of bad local authorities, but they do exist in sufficient numbers to be worth taking into consideration. My attitude to this particular Amendment might be different if I knew what was to happen to a later Amendment to alter the definition of local authorities. As the Bill stands, this power is to be enjoyed by rural district councils. There are many rural districtsâ€”I mean many, well over one hundredâ€”in which the people by whom the council are supposed to be elected do not even bother to hand in nomination papers on nomination day, and the members are elected by default. In those areas there is no discussion of the activities of the rural district councils.<br><br>
It may be said that this is a condemnation of the system under which local government is run, but the fact remains that in a great many areas the people affected by such a scheme as this would have no notion of what is happening until the thing is done. Powers have been given to local authorities to protect people from unfair tradesmen and others who may try to take advantage of their ignorance, and it is quite time that we protected the people from the danger of local authorities taking advantage of their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
ignorance. I think, therefore, there are adequate grounds for accepting this Amendment, which was moved so ably by my hon. and gallant Friend, who, I understand, is lifting up his voice in this House for the first time. Two hon. Members have spoken this morning for the first time within the precincts of this House, and I am sure the Committee will join with me in congratulating them and welcoming them, particularly after the considerable knowledge of local government which they have displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with what has been said by the hon. Member regarding rural district councils. It is my experience that in many cases rural district councils are every bit as efficient as urban district councils. We must admit that there are some urban district councils and some rural district councils which are inefficient, but I do not think that fact affects this case as much as the hon. Member thinks. At the same time I am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the Amendment. The chief objection seems to be that they would limit the powers which district councils already have, but we are passing a new Measure, and there is no reason why we should not insert new limitations. We know that local authorities may not like such a limitation of their powers, but there is no reason why we should not limit them if we think it necessary. The Minister also said that if these words and the words of a further Amendment were inserted it would make it appear as though some duties of a district council are more important than other duties. I do not think it would have that effect at all. It would only show that they ought to exercise more care, because they are dealing with a particular matterâ€”interfering with the liberty of the individual, and when they are doing that it is very necessary for them to be sure that they are supported by an adequate majority, so that action is not taken on the casting vote of the chairman or by a majority of one.<br><br>
I welcome the suggestion that a two-thirds majority should be necessary. I do not attach so much importance to publicity in the newspapers, because, as the Minister has pointed out, two public inquiries have to be held. If this Amendment is opposed, I shall wish to move an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
Amendment to leave out the words "other than buildings used for agriculture." I hope the Minister will reconsider his attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the legal point raised by the hon. and gallant Member for South Leicester (Captain Waterhouse) that his Amendment proposes to limit the definition of land by adding the words "to which this Act applies," I would ask the attention of the Attorney-General to this point. He suggested that that would deal only with lands specifically mentioned in the Act. The Mover then called attention to the proviso which limits it to lands specified under the proviso. My view of the law would be that the addition of the words would only have the effect of excluding such land as was mentioned in the Act. I should like the Attorney-General to say whether he confirms that view or not. If that view is right, the object of the Amendment is to provide that in the case of developed landâ€”that is, land on which there are buildings other than agricultural buildingsâ€”before a scheme can be adopted, there shall be a two-thirds majority in the local authority which adopts the scheme. As the Minister has said, this Bill goes further than any other Town Planning Measure by giving absolute power over all developed land in the countryâ€”that is all land covered with buildingsâ€”to the local authorities. That is a tremendous and far-reaching power and some of us have grave doubts as to whther the local authorities ought to have such power. In any event I venture to think that it is such an exceptional power that the larger majority ought to be necessary in the local authority. That is the object of the Amendment and if it goes to a Division I shall vote for it for that reason.<br><br>
The Minister's answer to the suggestion that there was any risk of any sort or kind, is that there are provisions in the Bill for two public inquiries. I would like him to point out where those inquiries are provided for in the Bill because owing to the hurry with which this matter has been brought on, I am not fully conversant with the details of the Bill. If these public inquiries are provided for, that would lessen the force of the criticism which I venture to make. But even if they are provided for, I do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
not think that they are sufficient for the protection of all the various interests concerned, unless we have the two-thirds majority. I agree with the hon. and gallant Member for Tiverton (Lieut.-Colonel Acland-Troyte). I do not like the limitation at the beginning of the paragraph and my name is attached to a later Amendment proposing to exclude from the Bill agricultural land which has no prospect of development. This Amendment as it stands, leaves the Bill applying with full force to such agricultural land and if it goes to a Division, I hope that that point may be protected and that we shall have an opportunity of voting for the exclusion of agricultural land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel FREMANTLE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Member for Southampton (Mr. Craven-Ellis) and the hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Moreing)â€”whom I congratulate on their speechesâ€”to consider whether Clause 1 is the right place at which to deal with this question. The title of this Clause is <i>"Scope of planning schemes."</i> The question raised in the Amendment is a question of procedure. I feel a good deal of sympathy with what they have said, but surely the convenient and a proper place for introducing this question is on the procedure Clauses, which are Clauses 6, 7 and 8? If they are really trying to limit the scope of these schemes, then I would remind them of those who are calling aloud for schemes immediately in order to preserve rural England. Despite the remark of the hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Sir J. Walker Smith), schemes are being called for in this way and I could give endless quotations to that effect which the hon. Member knows perfectly well. But you want to have a clean clear field for such schemes, and the clean clear field demanded by everybody is that the scope shall be all land whether built upon or not built upon. There is a clear distinction of principle there. If we intend to limit that scope as suggested by the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), that is a different question. The object of the Bill is, in principle, to include the possibility of all land, whether built on or not built on, and we can bring in restrictions and limitations later. I ask the Committee to leave the scope here, as the full scope, without any restrictions in general, and to introduce limitations and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
procedure later. I do not think that it would vitiate the point which the promoters of the Amendment have in mind when I suggest that it should be postponed to the procedure Clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the scope is so wide makes it all the more necessary for the Committee to be perfectly certain that adequate safeguards are provided. Under the Bill, as drafted, it will be possible for a local authority to undertake operations which in the ordinary way would necessitate coming to Parliament for a Private Bill. We know the procedure which attached to Private Bills and the various stages of that procedure are all in the nature of safeguards. If we are going to invest local authorities with these great powers, we must be careful to see that there are adequate safeguards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel FREMANTLE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that. I only say that this is not the place at which to put them in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and gallant Friend may be correct on that comparatively minor point, but it is not wise that local authorities should be allowed to embark on schemes of such magnitude as the schemes which they will obviously be allowed to undertake under this Bill, without the ratepayers being made fully aware of what is taking place. Vast expenditure by a local authority may be involved under this Bill, and a scheme may be put through with very little public attention being drawn to it. Parliament in the past has taken special care to see that local authorities should not be able to embark on schemes of extravagance without everybody concerned being made fully aware of the project in good time.<br><br>
The Borough Funds Acts extending from 1872 to 1903 provide all sorts of safeguards to prevent local authorities from embarking on schemes involving large expenditure. When we are dealing with a Bill which gives local authorities such a wide extension of powers, including powers which ordinarily they would not be able to exercise except by means of Private Bill legislation in Parliament, it behoves us to put in all the safeguards which appear necessary. As regards the reference of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Leicester (Captain Waterhouse) to the words "to which this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
Act applies," I read this Amendment in the same way as he does. I attach great importance to the addition of these words on their own merits, and apart from the proviso which stands later in the name of the hon. Member for Southampton (Mr. Craven-Ellis). I do not follow the argument of the hon. and learned Baronet the Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), and I too should like to hear from the Attorney-General his view of the right interpretation and effect of these words "to which this Act applies" if they are inserted in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir GEORGE HUME</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Debate has overlapped on to the proviso which stands later on the Paper. As has been pointed out by the last speaker, it is no new thing for a local body, as regards certain parts of its work, to have to follow certain procedure. Under the Borough Funds Acts, for instance, I believe it in some cases, if a local authority wishes to launch out on certain expenditure, it is necessary to have a town meeting. We are dealing here with a matter in connection with which private interests are greatly to be interfered with, and as one who has long been connected with the work of local authorities, I cannot help thinking that they would not resent particular conditions of procedure in such a matter. I think, however, that the two-thirds majority is rather too stiff a condition. What is already done is to require an assurance that there is an absolute majority of the authority in favour of a scheme of this kind before it is put into force. Under certain procedure it must be shown that the matter has been thoroughly considered by the authority with a sufficient number present to indicate an absolute majority in favour of the proposal. I think that would be ample protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In order to allay some of the apprehensions which have been voiced, may I call the attention of the Committee to the procedure Clauses â€”not only Clause 7, but also Clause 36 and the Fourth Schedule? If the Committee read there the Regulations as to procedure, I think they will find that their apprehensions are unfounded. I call attention to the procedure to which the Regulations apply:
<br><blockquote><p>"that there shall be co-operation with persons interested in the land proposed to be included in a scheme or order;</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<br><blockquote><p>that full information as to any proposal to prepare or adopt a scheme or order shall be given to the council of the county in which any land proposed to be included in the scheme or order is situate and to any other council concerned; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>that, where a resolution to prepare a scheme has been passed, the council of the county in which any land to which the resolution applies is situate shall be consulted with respect to the preparation of the scheme, unless the scheme is to be prepared by a joint committee of which the county council is a constituent authority."</p></blockquote>
I need not read the proviso, but if hon. Members will study this Clause in conjunction with the Fourth Schedule, 1 think that, whether or not they agree that these safeguards are adequate, they will agree that the hon. and gallant Member for St. Albans (Lieut.-Colonel Fremantle) was right in saying that the place at which to raise the issue is not on Clause 1, but on Clauses 7 and 36. I hope that explanation may relieve the apprehensions of hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the type of safeguard for which we ask, as not having been required in the town planning Measures of the past. We have never been asked in any of these Measures in the past to interpret the word "land" with the wide range, with which it is now intended to interpret it. Therefore, perhaps, the publicity for which we now ask was not then necessary, although I deem that it is necessary having regard to our experience under the previous Acts.<br><br>
With regard to Clause 36 to which we have had our attention drawn, the Minister of Health referred to public inquiries. May I remind him that before these take place certain resolutions are passed? These are the danger, because they sterilise the land. A resolution may be passed to-day, but months may pass before the public inquiry. In the meantime, the landlord can do nothing. Therefore, Clause 36 does not satisfy me as the Mover of the Amendment that we have in this Clause the adequate safeguards which the landlords require and insist upon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see anything in what the Parliamentary Secretary has called attention which removes our apprehension; quite the reverse. He calls our attention to Clause 7, an extremely long, complicated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
and elaborate Clause providing for the issue of tens of thousands of notices. Under Clause 36, he calls our attention to the fact that the Minister may make regulations dealing with the blessed word "co-operation," whatever that may mean, and for providing for various other information. Then he calls our attention to Schedule 4, which describes a considerable number of matters about which it is left entirely in the discretion of the Minister to frame regulations, still further complicating an already complicated Measure. Reference has properly been made to the Borough Funds Act, which provides the usual safeguards against local authorities being stampeded into extravagant expenditure without the general concurrence of the ratepayers. I know that that Act in all its procedure for the purpose of preventing large, unjustifiable and rash expenditure, does not apply to Scotland, but there are traditional reasons for excluding it.<br><br>
There is no doubt that there is a demand by local authorities for additional powers; that is not the demand that I have been questioning; but I say that there is not a public demand. Of course there is a demand from local authorities, from the officials and those temporarily in office, who believe that these powers can be invested in no more worthy and satisfactory persons that their noble selves. I understand that there is a demand from the Association of Municipal Corporations and kindred bodies. I can understand that demand, but I say that there is no general demand. The fact that there is a clamant demand from these bodies should, instead of carrying conviction, warn us that traditional powers should be given very grudgingly and only after careful consideration. Local inquiries are really no safeguard. An inspector is sent down, and there is a certain amount of ventilation of views. To that extent it is good and well, but the inspector can give no decision. He reports the result of his inquiries, which in due course receive consideration in the recesses of the Department.<br><br>
There is no safeguard in that. There will be publicity, but the public are in no way able to express their dissatisfaction as they are under the Borough Funds Act. Under that Act there is a public meeting, and the general public, apart
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1931-1932V000P0I0020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
altogether from the local authority who have special interests and are actuated by certain motivesâ€”the public who are influenced little by permanent officials and local authorities, can have the opportunity of expressing their views. If the meeting is unsatisfactory, they may demand a poll. There is, therefore, not only publicity, but the possibility of the public making their views felt and taking specific action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Sir Thomas Inskip)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Debate on this Amendment has been a little discursive. The hon. Member who has just spoken will forgive me for saying that his remarks would appear to be more relevant to a Second Reading Debate than to this Amendment. If I caught him rightly, he said that there is no particular demand for this Bill. I should like him to go down to my constituency flanking the borough of Portsmouth, and see whether the improvements made by the builders to the scenery and amenities of Hampshire are such as to make it desirable that there should be a town planning Bill. I have no particular desire to see the rights of private persons interfered with, but I have been in the last two or three years in receipt of hundreds of communications from all sorts of people pressing the necessity for town planning. That does not preclude the question as to how far we are wise in going. This Amendment proposes to put in words "to which this Act applies." They are in themselves rather otiose and meaningless unless we put in to what land the Bill does apply.<br><br>
It was suggested that the Bill would apply to all land in that case, except to that land which is expressly excepted. I do not know whether that would be so, or whether it would be necessary to put in words saying to which land the Bill does apply. It is purely a matter of drafting, but one way or the other must be adopted, and unless the Amendment is linked up with the proviso Amendment down in the name of the hon. Gentleman later, it seems to be impossible to discuss it with much advantage, because nobody knows, until somebody defines it, to what land they desire the Bill to apply. I gather that there is an inclination to say that the Bill applies to too much land, but I have not heard anybody say how far they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
think the Bill ought to go. It would be possible to discuss the Amendment with more advantage if someone had the courage to put down what land the Bill applies to. There are some Amendments on the Paper, but they are not Amendments in the name of the hon. Member who has moved this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is the proviso.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLANO-TROYTE</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had only one day to prepare Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not complaining, but I suggest that as the Bill is new to our minds, this question of limitation in certain conditions would probably be better raised on Clause 6, and it would be better to pass over this Amendment, subject to what my right hon. Friend says. This would not be attended with any embarrassment to those who moved it, because some limitations could be moved when we come to Clause 6. I do not think that we need preclude consideration of safeguards, if that be the proper term, such as providing for a two-thirds majority. I am not expressing an opinion. I am saying that at this stage it does not seem an advantage to discuss the whole Bill, local inquiries, safeguards, and land to which the Bill applies, on an Amendment which is not elucidated at present by anything very definite on the Order Paper. I do not see how we can get further with the Amendment to-day. Enough has been said to show that further consideration ought to be given to the questions which have been raised, and I suggest that the Amendment might be withdrawn, because there will be ample opportunity, when we get more familiar with the Bill, to consider how best an Amendment can be proposed which will raise the difficult question as to the exact land to which the Bill can be made to apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say a word by way of practical suggestion to my hon. Friend who proposed the Amendment, and give an undertaking? The Attorney-General's suggestion is a practical one. It is difficult to consider this question of the two-thirds majority limitation on this Clause and on this point. If my hon. Friend will be so good as to with-

draw his Amendment now, and move an appropriate Amendment on Clause 6, I will undertake that he will not be prejudiced by anything that has occurred to-day. On the contrary, this is admittedly an aspect of the Bill which is well deserving of careful consideration, and we shall all be glad to have an opportunity of thinking over the question of the two-thirds limitation before it

comes up again. Also, it will be easier to discuss it on Clause 6.</span></p>

<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
