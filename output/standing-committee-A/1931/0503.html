The object of the Amendment is to enable claims for betterment to be fairly judged. A provision of this kind is needed because an owner upon whom a claim is made may be considerably influenced as to whether similar claims have been made on neighbouring land. Betterment will be difficult to ascertain and it is only fair that anyone who has such a claim made upon him should be aware of the claims that have been made on neighbouring land. It would guide him in regard to his own claim. The object of the Amendment is to enable claims to be made somewhat on the same lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of HEALTH (Sir Hilton Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite follow the point of the hon. and gallant Member, but he will see that the Bill makes no difference to the amount of the claim upon the individual, and there is no question of it having any effect upon his legal rights and financial position. Now that we have postponed the making of claims until either there has been a change of user or the realisation of the betterment, it will not be possible to give notice of claims affecting neighbouring land. Owing to the changes we have made the Amendment is no longer appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the fact that we have made certain changes in the Bill and, therefore, I ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 32, line 25, to leave out Sub-section (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an Amendment of some substance. In the interesting memorandum on the Bill, the Minister of Health, in regard to compensation claims, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The general effect of this latter Subsection is to give owners of existing buildings an absolute right to compensation which neither the Minister nor the authority can touch."</p></blockquote>
This Sub-section does give the authority the power to touch this right to compensation. If they do not like to pay compensation, they can give notice to the owner that they wish to purchase his land. If they gave notice to the owner that they wanted to buy his land in the ordinary way, we should have no objection to it, but that is not the case. They propose to do it under the compulsory powers, and that is a definite infringement of the statement of the Minister that existing buildings shall have a right to compensation which may not be challenged either by the Minister or by the local authority. It is an important and definite point, which I need not elaborate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and gallant Member considers the circumstances which this Sub-section meets he will find that there is no hardship of the kind he describes. The circumstances are these. A man owns a plot of land on a highway. A town planning scheme may fix a building line, and owing to the fixing of that building line enough land may not be left to the owner of the plot of land to make it serviceable for building purposes. In those circumstances he is entitled to full compensation, and cannot be deprived of it. What the Sub-section says is this. It may be that the owner of the plot does not want to carry on, and he might pull the building down and go to compensation. What the Sub-section provides is that in those circumstances he shall give notice to the authority of his intention to pull down the building and, if he does, it is entirely at his own option, then the local authority shall have the right to acquire
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
the site. From the point of view of a local authority that is fair, because otherwise they might have to pay compensation for a site which might be left vacant and unprofitable for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, the authority has the right to acquire the building which, 	<i>ex hypothesi,</i> the owner no longer desires to use himself, then, until the coming into operation of a scheme, the authority will be able to let the building and recover a little of the loss they would suffer. It is a reasonable provision to enable an authority to avoid loss by a process which inflicts no injury on the owner. As to compensation, of course the greater includes the less. If the owner is paid the full purchase value of a plot of land which he no longer desires to use himself that includes and covers any right to compensation; he has sold at its full value something which he no longer desires to use himself. In those circumstances this is really a reasonable provision to enable a local authority to avoid loss, which is avoidable, without inflicting any hardship on the owner concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Minister of Health has put his case clearly and most persuasively. But is it not possible that compensation might come to more than the price paid, and that by switching over from compensation to compulsory purchase an authority might actually make money? If the Minister's contention is correct, and if he intends to stand by his statement about existing buildings, upon which I have no doubt at all, it would be fairer to put in a provision saying that the price paid shall not be less than the compensation plus a reasonable allowance for the amount of land which was not taken, which was left. A local authority should not use this Sub-section in order to save money at the expense of the owner. They might use it to take possession of the site and thus save the common purse at the expense of a particular individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given careful consideration to this point, and an examination of all possible cases has led to the conclusion that it is inconceivable that there could be any in which the purchase price would be less than the compensation. But the point having been specifically taken I will go into it further, and if it appears that there is any case
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
in which there might be such injury as the hon. and gallant Member has indicated, I will certainly meet it. I am sure that he will trust me to consider it. We do not want to load the Bill with unnecessary words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances I ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 33, line 21, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not in respect of any item contained in any claim award any greater amount than that claimed by that item."</p></blockquote>
This Clause contains instructions to which the official arbitrator shall have regard. I understand that the 1931 Bill contained a Clause providing that no order should be made to impose on any owner a greater charge than was originally specified by the local authority. It is possible that, if a claim was not agreed and went to an arbitrator, he would give an award greater than the claim originally put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTRY of HEALTH (Mr. Ernest Brown)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty in the way of accepting the Amendment. The point is really an academic one. It has only arisen once in the course of 90 years, when there was a decision in a particular case, not under town planning, but under the Lands Clauses Acts. This is impossible. If you put the Amendment in, claims would naturally be forced up to an impossible amount. That is the practical objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 33, line 21, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have power to reduce any claim made by an authority if he shall be of opinion that the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section twenty-one and Sub-section (2) of Section twenty-two of this Act have not been complied with."</p></blockquote>
This particular matter would be withdrawn from the purview of the arbitrator, and he would not be able to say that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
the claim had not been equitably reduced before submission to him. It is possible that the claim might be withdrawn already and the arbitrator would not have it before him. It is to guard against that contingency that I move the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under Clauses 21 (2) and 22 (2) the local authority is required to take all these matters into account and to reduce the claim to such an amount as is equitable. In any case, if a person considers that the local authority had not reduced the claim by such an amount, he would be able to appeal to the official arbitrator, who would have the power of decision. The point is covered, and the Amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 34, line 3, to leave out Sub-section (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Sub-section gives priority to the charge upon the land created by betterment. If a person's property is increased in value, until payment is made it is to be a charge on that person's interest in the property in priority to all other charges. I cannot see how this is going to work. In Scotland we have a Register of Sasines, which gives all charges on property registered there, and, if the Sub-section is not omitted, I suppose, when the Schedule is being applied to Scotland, the Law Officers will see that this is registered on the Register of Sasines so that people will know the real charges on the property. I cannot see why this charge should have priority to all other charges. I think it should rank with the ordinary charges on property, provided that a proper register is kept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that this is a new provision which was not in the 1931 Bill, and I wondered why it had been put in. It seems to depend very much on the legal interpretation of "all other charges." We want to know how this Clause will affect property which already has on it charges for mortgage and tithes and perhaps charges under the Agricultural Credits Act and charges of that sort. If you are going to have priority to all those charges, the way in which it will affect mortgagors and trustees will be good for the lawyers, but bad for everyone
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
else. There must be some explanation to show that it cannot be meant to supersede all charges already on the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Sir Thomas Inskip)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Clause is in the interest of small people, because, if a provision of this sort were not included, pressure would always be put on the arbitrator, where there was a little doubt as to the ability of the person liable to pay, to direct him to pay the 75 per cent. of the betterment in a lump sum under Clause 24 (1)(iii). A question of that sort is to be decided by the official arbitrator. If there was to be no security except the personal liability, inevitably, where a person was not likely to be good for the money over a term of years, there would be tendency to compel him to pay in one lump sum. That would be a hardship for many people, and, for that reason alone, it is not desirable to omit this Sub-section. The security of the property is all the greater in consequence of the betterment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the official arbitrator is not likely to err on the side of liberality to the local authorities. It is only 75 per cent. of the betterment which is to be a prior charge to all existing charges, and, as the value of the property is greater by 100 per cent., and only 75 per cent. is to take priority of all other charges, perhaps less, as an instalment or two may have been paid, I cannot quite see how the person to whom the property is charged by a prior charge is damnified. He has his security increased by 100 per cent. Then there comes in front of him a prior charge of 75 per cent., even assuming that no single instalment has been paid off it. In practice a provision of this sort is no hardship and does not work injustice. My hon. Friend opposite asked a question about the registration of charges in Scotland. I will take care that the notice of the Solicitor-General for Scotland is called to the point. I have no doubt that the charge will be registered. For 50 or 60 years or more charges analogous to these have been given priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MICHAEL BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What sort of charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Liability to pay a charge in respect of private street works under the Public Health Act, 1875. The Unionist Government in

	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
1925 gave priority to charges consequent upon the execution of repairs to houses in slum districts under the Housing Act of that year, and in a number of Acts of Parliament right down from the Public Health Act, 1875, charges of this sort have been given priority to other charges. It is only priority to charges upon a person's interest in the land. If a person is a leaseholder and has charged his leasehold interest, it is only the charge on that leasehold interest in the land which will be postponed to the payment of this betterment charge. It will not affect freeholders. If I have a leasehold interest in a piece of land for 99 years and I have charged that leasehold interest to someone, this betterment charge will take priority to the charge upon the leasehold interest. It will not take priority in respect of any charge upon the freehold property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It reduces the value of the freehold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. It is only priority to the charge upon the leasehold interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Sir MERVYN MANNIN GHAM-BU LLER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the position if you are a freeholder and not a leaseholder?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you are a freeholder, that is your interest in the land, and, if you have mortgaged your freehold interest, of course this betterment charge will take priority to the charge upon the freehold, whether first, second or third charges. It is the interest in the land that is affected by this provision. My hon. Friends may say, "That does not relieve our anxiety at all, because we are thinking of the position of the freeholder." I do not wish at all to shirk disclosure of the fact that, if there has been a first charge upon a freehold property and then a charge for betterment has to come in front of it, it will come in front of the holder of the mortgage. It is a provision which has appeared in a number of Acts of Parliament, and, so far as I know, no great hardship has been caused by it. I think it is in the interests of the freeholder that there should be a readiness on the part of local authorities to accept an award for payment by instalment, whereas, if this Sub-section is left out,
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
there might be pressure brought about to make everybody pay at the earliest possible moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall support this Amendment, because, in general practice, a charge of this description may have been arrived at, in the first place, in an atmosphere which probably does not always result in a true assessment as to betterment. Secondly, whatever that assessment may be, it is made a prior charge. What is the effect of that prior charge? Among surveyors and valuers it would be looked upon as being an extremely onerous burden. It may be that they do not even agree with the arbitrator that there is betterment. The property is mortgaged, and under this Bill the mortgagor will be called upon to have the property revalued, and this prior charge stands in front of it. The very fact that that prior charge stands there, with the powers behind it of the local authority, would in itself be an element which a valuer would take as something which would discount the value of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the case of building societies and the large amount invested in mortgages by insurance companies and trustee companies. They will be placed in a very serious position if anyone comes along having a priority claim, and I feel that these small owners, who are not so capable of looking after themselves as the large property owners, will find themselves in a difficult position, quite apart from the fact that their property may be written down in value due possibly to the psychological effect of this prior charge, not necessarily the amount of it. The small owners will be prejudiced, and the position of building societies will be equally prejudiced. Seeing that building societies have alone nearly Â£400,000,000 invested in small property, we must endeavour to safeguard that wealth, which belongs very largely to the small investors. I think we should not prejudice their position, and as a practical valuer, I say that you are doing something under this Clause which will be very prejudicial to the value when the surveyors approach the property. We have been told by the Attorney-General that provision in other Acts is made for similar priority, but that priority refers to something which is more tangible, and which definitely does go to increase the value of the property. I refer to such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
things as new street works or works to complete a street. In those cases the priority charge has been made, but if the valuation is made before the street is built, it is reduced by the liability for completion of that street. If the local authority calls for that highway to be made so that it car be adopted by the local authority, that definitely puts an increased value on the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of betterment is an entirely different matter. Betterment may arise out of an improvment which may have occurred some distance away from the property, and that is one reason why we should consider this matter extremely carefully. I know one particular company which has, by Act of Parliament, the power to carry out certain works, and that Act of Parliament gives them a prior annual charge to cover the cost of a certain improvement done on agricultural property. As a practical valuer, I can assure the Committee that that annual charge is always taken as an outgoing, and as depreciative of the value of the property. An improvement when carried out may cost Â£1,000, but that does not necessarily mean that it will put Â£1,000 on the marketable value of the property. Every time there is a conveyance of property a new item will appear: "Is there anything outstanding on betterment?", and if the reply goes in the affirmative, that is not going to help. Therefore, in the interests of the small owners whose money is invested in small property, and of building societies, I urge the Committee to give this Amendment very careful consideration and support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see that the argument which has been used by the Attorney-General is really a sound one for rejecting this Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton (Mr. Craven-Ellis) has already pointed out that in cases where certain expenditure has been made the first charge is not analogous to betterment, because certain work has to be done with reference to the property itself. Betterment is work which is not done with reference to the property, and it is extremely difficult to assess the actual value of betterment. The importance of this Amendment depends upon what words the Minister is going to insert, in view of the right hon. Gentleman's undertaking that betterment should not be payable until it was
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
realised. On those words the importance of this Amendment largely depends, because we have to see how much the actual value of the property has been proved to have increased before this charge is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Attorney-General how this Clause is going to affect Government charges on the property. What is going to happen in the event of a charge under the Housing Act of 1925, which is a priority charge, and which may conflict with the charge under the town planning scheme? This is a matter of very considerable substance. The question was raised about charges under the Rural Housing Act, which are not priority charges, but I want to know the position in which betterment stands in relation to those charges. If a loan is advanced by the local authorities, and it is admitted that the charge for betterment is realisable, it is difficult to assess and prove as a continuous betterment. Will that charge take preference over the charge under the Rural Housing Act, and how will the Government and the local authority who also have charges be affected? I think we should be very ill-advised if we passed this Clause as it stands without some clearer understanding of the reasons which make it desirable. With regard to the contention that if we do not have these words in betterment may be demanded in a lump sum, I confess that I do not attach so much substance to that, because if the betterment is not to be charged until it has been realised, it only means paying 75 per cent. of the sum realised. I do not regard the betterment being charged as a lump sum as being of any importance. I do not see any very good reason for retaining these words, and I see many reasons for objecting to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. MANNINGHAM-BULLER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to support this Amendment. I cannot understand what grounds there are for giving a priority charge for betterment over existing claims. There must be a great many cases where trustees have power to invest money on first mortgages. If this Amendment is not passed, and a betterment claim is made, the mortgages will cease to be a first charge, and will probably have to be called in. I understand that that will be the case with a freeholder occupying his own house. I do not see why this is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
necessary. The mortgage will have probably been advanced for about two-thirds of the value of the property, whereas if the betterment is actual and not an imaginary value, its security is ample. If the security is not there, the betterment is not there, so I think the betterment claim, if it really exists, is fully covered. There are grave objections to upsetting existing contracts by arbitrarily placing the charge for betterment in front of existing mortgages. Reference has been made to the charges of building societies and insurance companies who have large sums invested in first mortgages. I am quite prepared to give a priority to all other charges which may be made on the property after the betterment charges have been made, but I am strongly opposed to, and I see no ground for, placing the betterment charge in front of all existing charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HENRY CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Attorney-General has left this question in a very indefinite and vague form. Betterment has been payable under local Acts of the London County Council for many years, and I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether under those Acts if such a Clause as this is inserted, the betterment payable under those Acts has priority over other mortgages. It must be well understood, and common practice by now, under those local Acts where the principle of betterment has been adopted for so long. If this follows precedent, my objections might disappear, but, if property held by building societies is going to be subject to vague and indefinite prior charges, the prospect is rather appalling. I should like also to know what the Attorney-General meant by saying that a leaseholder was going to pay the betterment. Take the case of a house held under a lease with, say, five years unexpired. A scheme comes along, and a claim for betterment is made. Clause 21 says that a local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"may, subject to the provisions of this Act, recover from the person whose property is so increased in value an amount not exceeding seventy-five per cent. of the amount of that increase."</p></blockquote>
That is to say, it may be recovered from the person whose property is so increased in value. In the case of land subject to a lease of which five years are unexpired, is the betterment to be appor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
tioned between the leaseholder and the freeholder, or what is to happen? The Attorney-General, having come here to advise the Committee on the application of the principle of betterment, must have studied this question. From what he said, I gathered that it would be put on the leaseholder, but surely that cannot be so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say anything of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am pointing out that, if a person has a freehold interest and is liable to pay the betterment charge, that will be a charge upon his interest in the property, and the property will be liable to bear this new charge in priority to all other charges on the freehold. But if a person has a leasehold interest in the property, it will not affect the charge upon anyone else except the leaseholder so far as he is concerned. If the leaseholder has mortgaged his interest in the property, and it is sought to get this charge upon the property in front of the person to whom the leasehold interest is granted, it will come in front of that charge.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing with the question whether the mortgage would be affected. The whole point of this Amendment is that the value of charges upon property will be affected. I am pointing out that, so far as charges on leasehold interests are concerned, they will not be affected, because it is only the person's interest in the property that is charged, so that the whole class of leasehold mortgages will not be touched at all, so far as I understand the Clause, in practical operation. It is true that when you get back to the freeholder there will be a charge in priority to the charge upon the freehold interest, and undoubtedly that comes first. I said before, and I do not wish to shirk it, that that is the fact.

The broad answer to all these criticisms is that there has not been a single complaint from the building societies and insurance companies who are said to have, and have, this vast interest in property. If they were so anxious as my hon. Friends opposite profess to be about this Clause, surely we should have had some protest from them, but we have had no protest from any building society or insqrance company with all this interest in property that has been mentioned this morning. Surely that is a striking fact. If the Committee thought that this instalment system was not one that would work, I should have thought that there might be some reason for leaving out the instalments altogether from the Bill, especially now that the payment is to be postponed; but I thought that the provision as to instalments was put in in the interests of the small property owner, who may not have ready cash, to enable
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
him to meet his obligations on easy terms. It would be cutting at the root of that provision to say that a person who is allowed to pay by instalments by order of the official arbitrator will offer nothing except his personal covenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You can make a charge, but it need not be a prior charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of priority is the only point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The priority of the charge is going to affect the facility with which the instalments are collected. If the Committee were to take the view, which I am sure they do not, that it is desirable to cut instalments out of the Bill altogether, that is a possible course, but the course now proposed is to leave them in the Bill, and to cut out this Sub-section (4), which is really part and parcel of the instalment provision. That is illogical, and, in view of the absence of any uneasiness or complaint on the part of the building societies and insurance companies, I venture to think that the Committee are feeling a little over-anxious about this matter. I have not heard any case mentioned this morning where mortgages have been called in because of the intervention of some prior charge arising out of old Acts of Parliament. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Northampton (Sir M. Manningham-Buller) was, I think, over-imaginative when he. said that a trustee mortgage on two-thirds of the value of the property would be affected by the priority of this 75 per cent. of betterment. I think most trustees would be delighted to find that property on which they had advanced two-thirds of the value was going to secure the great advantage of an improvement in the amenity of the district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. MANNINGHAM-BULLER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Attorney-General quite understood me. I think there are cases in which trustees only have power to lend money on mortgage so long as it is a prior charge, and, the moment you put something in advance of it, it is no, longer a prior charge, and they would not be able, by the terms of the trust. to retain the money in that investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think my hon. and gallant Friend is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
correct. I am not saying that there might not be a special provision in a trust deed empowering the trustees only to advance money and leave it charged upon property so long as there was absolutely nothing in front of it, but I am not familiar with such a provision, and I doubt if it is ever inserted. If it were, it would be a very strange provision, and one which probably could not be carried into effect, having regard to all the provisions in many Acts of Parliament regarding the priority of certain charges of the character of those with which we are now dealing. I do not believe that any trustee or other person who had advanced money on the security of a freehold interest in a property would be anything but delighted to find the property improved in value by the execution of such works as we have under consideration here, notwithstanding that he might find his charge postponed in favour of a prior charge in respect of 75 per cent. of the value of the betterment. Let any hon. Member tell me of a case where a building society or owner has been affected by the priority of these charges, and at once I will, and I am sure the Minister will, consider the question again. In the absence of any specific complaint or representation from any of these societies, I go the length of saying that this Clause is in the interest, not only of the landowner, but of the small person who will be liable to pay these charges for betterment, and may be allowed to discharge that obligation by the instalments for which the Bill makes provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are two statutory charges which have priority, I have no doubt that one which has already taken effect comes in front of one which takes effect later.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount CRANBORNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not press this Amendment. I think the Committee are unduly anxious on this question. Suppose that a man has bought a property, and raises a mortgage on it secured on the existing value of the property, and then there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
an increase of value by betterment. The betterment charge is only on the additional value created, and it is not even as though that were a potential value, because we have a definite promise from the Minister that it shall only be the realised value. Therefore, he has 100 per cent. in his pocket, and he pays 75 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. MANNINGHAM-BULLER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, obviously there is ample security for the betterment charge, without making it a prior charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount CRANBORNE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not finished. After the betterment charge is paid, there is still the same security for the mortgage as there was before. My hon. and gallant Friend asks, why make it a priority charge? It seems to me that there is ground for compromise. Technically, I think that mortgagees may feel that they have been hardly treated, because they had a first charge, but now they have not a first charge. Their charge, although it is perfectly secure, is now the second instead of the first charge. I think that the right way to deal with this matter would be to accept the Amendment of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Northampton (Sir M. Manningham-Buller). Then the mortgagees will at least know exactly where they stand; they will not have a first charge and then suddenly find it changed into a second charge. If I might make the suggestion, possibly my hon. Friend might withdraw his Amendment, and then the Committee could continue the discussion on the Amendment of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Northampton, and possibly the Minister would be willing to give us a concession on that point, which I think would probably meet the wishes of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad to accept the Amendment of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Northampton (Sir M. Manningham-Buller), which would meet my point. I thought that the case made by the Attorney-General was extremely weak. The only strong point was that he has received no protest, but no doubt people who might have made a protest would refrain from doing so on seeing these Amendments on the Paper, thinking that they ought to be carried. I am bound
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
to say that the arguments used by the learned Attorney-General are the strongest case for the Amendment. If he makes this a priority charge, then the mortgagor would have less security, and there are many other things besides mortgages which must be considered. I think it is quite wrong that betterment should be given priority over all these other interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain in a word why I have not been able to meet the wishes of the Committee at once on this Amendment? It is because I am bound to defend, other things being equal and no injustice being done to the citizen, the policy that public debts should take priority over private debts. It is my duty to defend that policy and to call upon the Committee to maintain it. It is suggested that we should meet the case by taking a certain course, that course being to accept the Amendment of the hon. and gallant Member for Northampton (Sir M. Manningham-Buller), to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"created after the coming into operation of the scheme or the execution of the work which caused the increase in the value of the property."</p></blockquote>
That means that existing charges would retain whatever priority they possess, and that owners of various interests would not be able to create charges afterwards which would take precedence of public debts. That is worth considering, and I have reviewed it carefully. In view of the principles laid down with so much force and clearness by the learned Attorney-General, I have come to the conclusion, after consulting my right hon. and learned Friend, that the requirements of the case would be met by accepting the Amendment of the hon. and gallant Member for Northampton. It would maintain the principle of the priority of public debts, which it is our duty to maintain, and avoid any of those reflections on the position of existing interests in land to which reference has been made. I suggest that the Committee should reject the Amendment and accept that of the hon. and gallant Member for Northampton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Clause, as it is drafted, enables an authority to escape claims merely by making a modification of a very slight nature. That is really not the intention of the Minister, and the Amendment would be a slight improvement on the Clause. No great difficulty arises, because an authority can at any time propose an amended or modified scheme under Clause 8, and it would have to comply with regulations just as if it were part of the original scheme. The only way to avoid a claim would be by withdrawing the provisions which give rise to the claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the Amendment would be to make the procedure in certain cases very cumbrous, very costly and unpractical. The authority would have to make a scheme revoking a particular provision and then make a new scheme including the substituted provision. Under the Clause, they can achieve both these objects by one operation. The provision is in the interests of the person whose cause has prevailed, that is, the party whom the hon. Member has in mind. It will enable the situation resulting from a withdrawal to be dealt with in a manner which is less troublesome to both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member suggests that the Clause might be used in a manner to inflict hardship. There is a practical guarantee against that, and practical guarantees are much more important than legal guarantees. If an authority were to "play the fool," shall I say, and tried to do in some other way the very thing which it had already failed to do, it would have to pay all the costs of the fresh proceedings before the same arbitrator and also any abortive expenditure which the party might have suffered. A power which is useful for the purposes of administration could not possibly be used to the detriment of the private individual concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a good deal of discussion on this point on the previous Bill. It is a question of the powers of local authorities to purchase land, leaving the development of the frontages more in the hands of private owners and less in the hands of a town planning authority. If private owners have control, it would be better to leave the development of the frontages in their hands rather than in the hands of a local authority. Another point arises. I should have thought local authorities already have enough power in their hands. Under the Public Health Act, 1875, Section 176, an authority has ample power for the purpose in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and in many local Acts, which are to be repealed, there are numerous precedents for the refusal of compulsory powers for the purpose where property owners have opposed the Act. There is a difference in the wording between this and the Bill of 1931. The earlier Bill deals with land required
	<br><blockquote><p>"for carrying out or securing the satisfactory development of frontages to or of lands abutting."</p></blockquote>
This is much more drastic. It speaks of land required
	<br><blockquote><p>for carrying out the improvement or controlling the development of frontages to, or of lands abutting."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given careful consideration to the Clause and the Amendment to see whether we are going too far in the direction of giving powers of control, and I have come to the conclusion that the fears expressed by my hon. and gallant Friend need not be apprehended. First of all, we are dealing with one of those provisions of the existing law which are only put into this Bill because it is a code, and the alteration in the wording to which my hon. and gallant Friend referred is quite a minor matter. Secondly, I think it really is in the economic interest of all parties con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
cerned, of the owners of the land as much as of the planning authority, that the planning authority should be given power to acquire these lands concerned for the improvement or controlling the development of frontages of land abutting or adjacent thereto. It will enable them, while increasing the economic value of the land concerned, by getting it in a single hand, to avoid loss of value to the owners who are left with scraps of unsuitable land. It is a way in which the general value can be increased and a fair share of the increase in the general value be left to the owners, who will be able to find a market for scraps of land which will be of very little value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those conditions it is really in the interest of both parties concerned. There is adequate protection against this power being used in a more extensive manner than would be considered necessary, because it cannot be used without the approval of the Ministry, who would confine it to the specific purposes of tile Act, and it will be very useful in dealing with that specific evil of modern times, the bad forms of ribbon development which are such terrible wastages of value to the countryside. It is a power which I believe the Committee will think fit to leave in the hands of the planning authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Municipalities are intended to carry on local government, and, in my view, they are not adapted for the ownership of land. I hope that, in the later stages of the Clause, the Committee will realise that rather serious principles are involved, and that, if we do not stand on the principle involved by this beginning part, the principle of voluntary purchase, we shall insist on restricting the powers of municipalities to acquire by compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a small Amendment, but it brings us to the first question referred to by my Noble Friend with regard to compulsory powers. The Minister will point out that this Sub-section only refers to purchase by agreement. There will be no difficulty with regard to the case of a joint owner if we are dealing purely with purchase by agreement, but when we come to Sub-section (2), where a local authority may have power to purchase compulsorily land which falls into the classifications listed above, the Amendment will give the adjoining landowner the first chance to buy that land which has been taken away to form a highway and which, when the highway is blocked up, may easily cause a strip of property cutting his property in half to be compulsorily purchased by the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to meet the Amendment to an extent which I think the Committee will agree is fair. In the ordinary case the land on which the highway runs is the property of the adjoining owner, subject to highway rights, and in that ordinary case, when the land ceases to be a highway, it is fair that the local authority should have the right to acquire it at its value. But there is this frequent case, that the land has ceased to be the property of the adjoining owner, but a statutory right has been given to the adjoining owner to repurchase the land if it ceases to be a highway. I do not think it would be proper or fair that by this Statute we should take away a right which has been conferred by another, and, therefore, in those cases where the land on which the highway runs has ceased to be the property of the adjoining owner, but he has a statutory right to purchase it, I propose to insert a special provision to preserve to him that statutory right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This raises a very difficult question, because there are very many objections to granting compulsory powers to expropriate " A " so as to give it to " B," and, if that sort of thing is going to be done which this Clause gives local authorities power to do, even the right of appeal does not justify the inclusion of such powers. Very grave abuses may occur under powers given to a local authority to purchase land from one person so as to give it to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I rather deprecate the principle of expropriating "A" to reinstate "B." Later on I should like to move to omit the word "occupied" from that proviso. I will not argue that point now, but I will make it when the time comes to move my Amendment. My argument is that the word "occupied," if it remains in the Clause, may mean the occupation of farm cottages which might be taken under the powers of the Clause. They may be unoccupied only temporarily, owing to agricultural depression, but when things are better the word "occupied" would have a much wider meaning than would appear at first sight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. and gallant Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Brown) has stated, it is true that this point was raised in the last Debate on the subject and the Amendment was withdrawn. I call attention to the fact that it was withdrawn because it was thought that the local authority might use this power to 'acquire the business of some shopkeeper and then put in another person as his rival. That point has now been met by the proviso in Clause 27, Sub-section (2), as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that they shall not be authorised to purchase any land compulsorily for the purpose of sub-paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of the foregoing Sub-section."</p></blockquote>
There have been cases where local authorities have been very badly mulcted in compensation because they could not offer the accommodation required. With regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Rhys), I understand that there is no objection to omitting the word "occupied." The case which the hon. Member for Guildford put is one which might arise, but the words I have read meet the point put by the hon. and gallant Member for Newbury as to the danger of these compulsory powers being used to the detriment of some other person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
think we are giving extraordinary powers to the local authority. It must not be forgotten that these words apply to all Areas, including the City of London and other cities, and here power is being given to the local authority not only to make an improvement, but to reinstate anybody they choose. This is extraordinary power to give to a local authority, because power to provide accommodation may mean anything, and it may mean reinstating a shopkeeper and his business anywhere. I shall certainly vote against this, because it gives powers to the local authority which are excessive and extreme and may be abused. I object to the Amendment being withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 36, line. 29, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that they shall not be authorised to purchase compulsorily any land abutting on a new street or an existing street as proposed to be widened under the scheme for the purpose of securing the development or redevelopment of such land, but nothing in this Section shall prejudice or affect the operation of the Public Health Acts."</p></blockquote>
We have been so harmonious in our discussions up to the present that I am reluctant to move an Amendment which may raise a discordant note. Hon. Members who have read this Clause carefully will find that the earlier part, dealing with purchase by agreement, does not amount to much, and this Committee ought to be very careful about extending powers of compulsory purchase to municipalities. The ratepayers have suffered very much in recent years. The burden of the rates has become intolerable, and the more we can curtail municipal expenditure the better for the ratepayers, and the better for the trade and business of everyone affected by rates. One of the few sound arguments in favour of the Bill, which I still do not like, has been that this very large amount of control which has been given over individuals makes municipal ownership and direct control in that way unnecessary. By this Bill the necessity for compulsory purchase and for municipalities to own land is diminished to a large extent, and I hope the Minister of Health will see his way to limit the powers of compulsory purchase as suggested in my Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
It is essentially the business of the individual to develop frontages, and it is better that this development should be carried out by the individual than by the municipality. A committee of the local authority may be adapted for carrying out street works, drainage; and matters of that kind affecting local government, but such a committee is not adapted to become the owner or developer of property, and these matters are better left to the individual. That is why the principle of compulsory purchase has been omitted from a number of local Acts. The principle of compulsory purchase has been omitted from many local Acts even by voluntary agreement, and the number of instances where that principle has been omitted in compulsory agreements is considerably larger. I think we should follow that precedent, and make the local authority rely on voluntary purchase and agreement, and to that extent limit what may be the risk of speculation with the ratepayers' money, which may inflict a hardship and would not be in the best interests of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given very close consideration to this Amendment, and I was most anxious to hear what the Noble Lord had in mind in proposing it. Now that I have heard what he has in mind, I am confirmed in my belief that the Amendment does not really take into account the existing state of the law, and that is most natural, because the existing state of the law is covered by a good many Statutes and is difficult to comprehend. Under the Public Health Acts, local authorities already have power compulsorily to acquire land for frontages, and make them good. In this Bill practically we are not giving them that power, but we are simply dealing with the manner in which that power may be exercised. Under this Bill we shall have a more practical, a more up-to-date, and indeed a more economical procedure. We shall have a procedure which will be more convenient to the owners and the local authority in the exercise of those powers, and it is all to the good that we should maintain the Bill in its existing form. The only effect of the Noble Lord's Amendment would be to throw the local authorities back upon the old cumbrous procedure of the Public Health Acts.

	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
As to the procedure regarding the exercise of powers under this Measure, that is a point on which, naturally, the Committee will require assurances, so I may say that the owners and the local ratepayers will find that they are safeguarded by the kind of provision which the Committee is wont to require, under the special procedure laid down in the Third Schedule, including special notices and a local inquiry before the powers are exercised. I should join with the Noble Lord in resisting any provision which would put the local authorities in a position to act as speculators, owners, and developers in developing land, but the restrictions in the Bill would prevent them from using such powers for any purpose except to square up the difficult business of getting the frontages on new roads right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we understand from the Minister that the powers in the Clause are not in effect materially different from the already existing powers, it may be that my Noble Friend might see his way to withdraw the Amendment, but what we are frightened of, and I think with cause, is the hysteria which seems to affect people in connection with town planning. Only yesterday I was at a meeting of the finance committee of my own local authority, where the most outrageous things were suggested under the cover of planning, and we fear that it may be possible to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"O, planning, what crimes are committed in thy name!"</p></blockquote>
We do not want to see included in those crimes land speculation or municipal corporate ownership. I should like to understand from the Minister, first, whether the Clause as it stands does not in effect make it easier for local authorities to apply compulsory purchase than is the case at present; and, secondly, whether the Minister is convinced that there are or will be in the Schedule adequate safeguards against any form of land speculation or against the inclusion in the Bill of any power to assist in municipal land ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will only be made easier for them in so far as the Bill rids them of cumbrous and antiquated procedure and introduces a more businesslike procedure. It does not make it possible, under the provision we are

considering, for the local authorities themselves to act as developers of land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SELLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loth to intervene on this point, but I should like to understand the Minister's position with regard to such an authority as the London County Council. With us it is not a case of clearing up a little corner of land or squaring up a portion. I am thinking of huge tracts five miles square, such as Becontree and St. Helier, where we are bound under an Act of Parliament to house the people outside our area, as it is impossible to house them within it We are bound, under our statutory obligations, to become actual speculators in the land itself, because we are setting up a township, and have to provide amenities other than housing, such as shopping centres, churches, licensed houses, and so on. I hope that nothing that has been said on this Amendment would in any way reflect on what we are doing in that direction, because I think we shall have to continue in a small way to carry out this same sort of development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I desire to leave out Clause 35, and I do so to give my right hon. Friend an opportunity of implementing the precise definition which the Minister gave on the Second Reading, that this was a permissive Bill only and contained no compulsory features. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a local Bill, and not a centralising Bill. It is not a Bill to confer arbitrary powers on a distant centralised officeâ€¦This is not a Bill of compulsion, but one of permission. It is a Bill simply to put powers which the people want into their hands to use as and when they desire to use them. It is not a Bill to force action down the throats of the local authorities." â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd February, 1932; col. 41, Vol. 261.]</p></blockquote>
This Clause has definitely the effect of forcing action on the local authorities. In my contention the local authorities, so far as they are fit to perform the duties under the Bill, are fit to decide whether they can perform those duties or not. It should not be in the discretion of the Ministry of Health to decide whether an authority should embark on a course of action when it is capable of deciding for itself whether it will or not. The Minister may rely on it that where there is a real demand that town planning shall be embarked on, local pressure will be quite enough. The point is quite a simple one. In view of the fact that this Clause does enable the Minister to compel local authorities to embark on a course of action which they may hold to be expensive, extravagant, or useless, the Clause, in my opinion, should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

from beginning to end. It is difficult to decide which is the worst Clause in it, but I think that Clause 35, even as amended, is one of the dangerous Clauses of this Bill. You have only to look at the first few words of the Clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Minister is satisfied after the holding of a local inquiry that a scheme ought to be prepared by any authority as respects any land, he may by order require the authority to prepare a scheme and to take such other steps as may be necessary for bringing it into operation."</p></blockquote>
I think it is a matter of common agreement amongst many Members of this House, and certainly a matter of very common agreement among the general public, that the process which has gone on for many years past of putting powers in the hands of a Government Department has reached a time when the rights of property owners and others are being seriously menaced by the invasion of bureaucratic control over our private affairs. I sincerely hope that as a consequence of the sittings to-day and next Thursday we shall be able to finish the Committee stage of this Bill, but I think it is time that a protest was made on behalf of the dumb, inarticulate masses outside Parliament, against the tendency of Ministers to force this sort of legislation through the House of Commons, and on to the people of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a thoroughly bad Clause. It is true it has been amended to some extent, but I want to repeat what I said a few weeks ago at the beginning of this Committee. Some of us endeavoured to ensure that the county council should be the authority for the purposes of town planning. We were told then by the Minister and by the Parliamentary Secretary that our Amendments were "conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity," and that we did not know the first thing about the subject. Now, when we have got to Clause 35, and my hon. Friends opposite suggest that the county councils should be consulted on certain aspects of the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary informs us that these Amendments will be accepted. I hope my hon. Friends will produce further Amendments at a later stage which the Parliamentary Secretary will accept in the same spirit. This Clause extends the stranglehold of Government officials on the people of this country. It is one of the worst Clauses in the Bill, and I hope the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I might raise here a point which should really have been raised earlier; that is, the question of whether or not under any Clause, even under this Clause, the Bill applies to Crown lands, and whether, if the Clause remains part of the Bill, town planning regulations can be enforced on Crown lands. I think that under existing town planning legislation Crown lands are exempt. I do not think anybody would suggest that town planning schemes should be brought into force on Crown lands. If the War Department decided to sell a piece of land, I do not think that it should be in any better position than a private owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Rhys) is in Clause 32. If he will look at that Clause, he will find that a scheme cannot be extended to Crown lands except by agreement of the Crown. That is the usual provision in such legislation, which this Bill follows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that altogether, but I accept it for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the general principle of public law, that the Crown is not affected except by its own consent. I give it with diffidence, but on good authority. As to the merits of the Clause, the Noble Lord is quite right. The scheme of the Bill is to be a voluntary Bill, but it is this Clause which enables one to leave the general machinery of the Bill completely voluntary in its application. When you are doing something which is desirable in the public interest, you must put in some sort of provision for seeing that what is obviously in the public interest shall not be grossly disregarded; and this is the provision which enables the Ministry or the county council, in the case of a gross disregard of the obvious duties under the Bill, to step in and see that the public interest is served. If this were not in the Bill, you could not leave it a voluntary Bill, as I claim it is, and it is this Clause which enables one to make it voluntary. I do not think the Committee will have any difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that this final residual power to avoid gross disregard of obvious duties is one which it is proper to leave to the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
If the Committee will forgive my saying so, I am not in the least affected by attacks on the extensions of bureaucracy. You cannot run a country unless you leave, in the Ministers of the Crown, who are responsible to Parliament, final residual powers to see that the will of Parliament, as expressed in Acts of Parliament, is carried out; and this is the minimum power which is necessary here. This Clause is drawn up on the model of provisions which are familiar in many Acts of Parliament. In the first place, let me say that this is part of the existing law, so here again we are up against one of those discussions which arise from one's desire to put a whole code of law before the Committee. If this had been omitted, this point could not have been discussed. It makes no change in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give some typical examples of instances in which similar provisions are included as a residual power to ensure that the law does not become a dead letter. There is the default Section of the Public Health Act, 1875, but the most recent instance of this kind of thing is the Local Government Act of 1929, as to the purification of sewerage systems and sewage disposal works. If I might put it in this way to the Committee, we all know that in the working of legislation these powers are not as a fact in practice ever called into use, but the fact that they exist ensures that the line of policy sketched out by the Act shall be taken seriously by the local authority, and for that purpose such a clause has been found necessary in previous Acts and it is indeed no less necessary in the present one. I am confident, therefore, that the Committee will not depart from precedent in allowing these powers to remain part of the existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MOREING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says he is unmoved by attacks caused by fear of bureaucracy in the form of Acts of Parliament introduced by Government Departments. When I have attended in this House for the requisite number of years and am a Minister in authority, perhaps I shall stand up and defend authority in the same way, but I do say that the Clause is going too far in the powers that it gives to the Minister. The Minister's last words really bear out the fears that I entertain. He thinks it a useful thing to have these powers put there, to be kept
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
in reserve so that they may be used if necessary. I strongly urge on this Committee, and shall do so in the House of Commons, that the time has come when we must not put Clauses in a Bill, even in the House itself, to give the Minister a reserve power upon which he may act in the future. We see, day after day and year after year, that the rights and privileges of the people have been taken away because of some Clause slipped into a Bill. They say that the circumstances in view of which this Clause is inserted may arise in the future. I hope my Noble Friend the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Marquess of Hartington) will press this matter to a Division and that the Committee will strike a blow at this kind of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister has realised that all the regulations in the Schedule will necessitate the re-writing of Clause 36 on Report. If my hon.

	<p>contention that this is the existing law, because it is such laws that have reduced our country to the verge of beggary and are the cause of our Budget having risen to Â£766,000,000 a year and the local rates to Â£140,000,000 a year. We cannot afford to go on passing laws like this and, if this Committee can do anything to restore liberty to our people, it will perform a great service. I am unmoved by the contention that this Clause makes the Bill a permissive one. It cannot be said that the powers which exist under this Clause enable the Minister to see that whether you go in for the town planning scheme or not is voluntary; but, if you do not, or if it is not the kind of scheme that he likes, he may say, "I shall come in and do it at your expense." That cannot be said to be a permissive Clause.</p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the report of the person holding such inquiry shall at the request of any person represented at the inquiry be open to inspection by him."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment really explains itself, and I hope it will commend itself to my right hon. Friend. He will say perhaps that it is not necessary because the report would be available for anyone who was affected by it, but for the sake of clearness it can do no harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this Amendment goes a little bit further than my Noble Friend thinks, because I believe I am right in saying that the report of the Minister's inspector who holds these inquiries is a confidential document, which is never shown to anybody. The report is sent in and is considered by the Minister or his advisers, and for all that the people in the locality know, the advice given by this inspector may be completely disregarded. It seems to me to be almost a negation of justice that the judge should not give any finding. This expert goes down, presumably an inspector who is in the confidence of the Ministry, advertisements are sent round, notices are sent round, and every care is taken to bring into this inquiry every sort and kind of person who might be interested in the scheme. The inquiry is held, the inspector makes a full and ample report, and then, as far as the outside world is concerned, the matter dies. The inspector might just as well never have issued a report, as far as the outside world is concerned. The report goes back into the Department; possibly it is accepted 	<i>in toto,</i> possibly it is accepted in part, and the views of the Ministry or of the local authority prevail. It is to prevent what seems to me to be waste of public funds in holding an inquiry without a finding that I put my name to this Amendment, and I hope my right hon. Friend will carefully consider it before he decides that he cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that my hon. Friends will not press this Amendment. The observations of the hon. and gallant Member for South Leicester (Captain Waterhouse) were, as they always are, very clear, and he put his finger exactly upon the point. But they also showed that there isâ€”may I call it?â€”a fallacy underlying the Amendment. The actual judge in these cases is not and ought not
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
to be the inspector; the actual judge must be the Minister in the exercise of his full responsibility â€” his responsibility as Minister to the House of Commons. He has to form a judgment in these cases, and the inspector and his inquiry are, as it were, only the eyes and ears of the Minister. I desire to represent most. earnestly to the Committee that it is a matter of the very first importance, towards enabling this important function to be adequately discharged, that the Minister should be able to have the absolutely unfettered, uncontrolled and free mind of the inspector about everything into which he inquires, and that the inspector, in putting the case which he has ascertained to the Minister, should not be under any of those " inhibitions " â€”in the popular phraseâ€”which would result if he had to state things in such a form as to make it possible to present them to the public. It would be a very serious blow to the proper and fair exercise of the functions of the Minister if the report of the inspector had to be made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect of this Amendment, and that is, of course, that the Ministry of Health is constantly holding countless inquiries, in many of which the reports are not appropriate for publication at all. We ought always to consider the reactions of the legislation which we enact, and this is a matter which ought to be dealt with on those general lines and not on the particular lines of this case. Actually, in the particular circumstances of town planning inquiries, I think that it would be of very grave detriment to the public interest and to the best interests concerned to have a formal published report standing between the Minister and the full and free exercise of his unfettered discretion upon absolutely confidential And unfettered information provided to him by the inspector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend hope to revive the Court of Star Chamber before long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says makes me very unhappy now that I did not vote against Clause 35 instead of saying "No vote." Under Clause 35 the Minister has absolute power, and if he is in that position and appoints an inquiry, he is the judge, entirely by himself. If he refused to,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
allow the publication of the report made to him, then I really think that Clause 35 is made much worse than I thought it could be. I urge the Minister, if he can, to make it clear that even his own secret inquiry under Clause 35, or anything else, shall be reasonably accessible to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather appreciate what the Minister said of many of the reports of the numerous inquiries that he can hold, that they should be kept secret, leaving the Minister still an absolute judge in matters many of which could not suitably be made public. Under this Bill he can hold any number of inquiries, but the suggestion which I wish to make to him is, whether it would not be possible to make an exception in the case of a report of a local inquiry into the first proceedings, the resolution for a scheme. That affects the inhabitants very vitally; it is part of the initiation of the scheme before its final conclusion, and I think it would be very desirable that such a report should, if possible, be open to the inspection of the various parties concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I might just echo my hon. and learned Friend's words, I understand that the new Schedule that is coming into this Bill is going to lay down that there shall be one or two specific and certain local inquiries. I wish to suggest, not that when the Minister sends down an inspector to inquire into a scheme, everything that he reports shall be published, but that in the central inquiries on which the whole scheme hinges, it might, as my hon. Friend says, be possible to have publication. I urge this point on the Minister. I am not very conversant with many of these inquiries, but I am informed that it often happens that one of the applicants makes out a case to the inspector; he thinks he has the sympathy of the inspector with him and that he has carried his point, and perhaps he does not go on to adduce all the evidence that he might. Then, to his horror, when the decision is taken, he finds that for some reason quite unknown and quite unknowable the case goes completely against his point of view, and the decision of the Minister is quite contrary to that which he was led to hope the inspector's report would indicate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the criticisms of my hon. and learned and hon. and gallant Friends with very great attention, and I do see in them a point to be taken. I think that the arguments which I have already advanced to the Committee are entitled to prevail wherever the ordinary procedure is being followed; that is, when the local authority is undertaking its own town planning scheme. I must remind the Committee that the Minister has now been subjected, by the common consent of us all, to the final review of Parliament; therefore, if, as a result of a public inquiry, there is any question to be asked which requires a public answer, there is an occasion upon which the Minister can he obliged to answer it. If the Committee will forgive my saying so, that is the right procedure, because the Minister, according to all our ideas of constitutional procedure, is the judge, and it is Parliament to which he is responsible. It is therefore in this relation to Parliament that he ought to be called upon to give any explanation of the inquiry. I am impressed by what was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Brown). Undoubtedly, when the Minister supersedes the local authority, there is, as it were, a pre-eminent exercise of power, and when there is a pre-eminent exercise of power by the Minister in superseding the local authority, then I think the public and the ratepayers are entitled to be satisfied in a particular degree that there is a necessity for a supersession. Therefore I suggest, in order to meet the criticisms that have been made, that I shall agree that the report be published in the case where the Minister is himself carrying out the power by supersession under Clause 35. That will, I think, meet the particular case made by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Newbury and also bring the matter into full relation with what is really the practice of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will consider that in drafting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. MORRIS-JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman specify more particularly in what cases he is going to allow the publication of these reports? He is here giving a concession right through this Bill, one of the most important concessions that has been given in the course of many sittings of this Committee. It is undermining the whole foundation of inquiries. I do not know of any inquiries undertaken by any Government Department or by any Minister in the past where the duly constituted officer who has been sent down locally to conduct the inquiry has not possessed full, free, and unfettered discretion to make any recommendations whatsoever to the Minister. How can any officer sent down to any locality write a report to the Minister if he knows that it cannot possibly be a confidential report and that it is likely to be scrutinised by parties interested in the inquiry? I trust that the Minister will very narrowly define this concession. It is one of the biggest concessions that could be made by a Committee in this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can define it quite precisely; in the case of proceedings under Clause 35. The reason is this, that in practice it would be impossible for the Minister himself to supersede the local authorities without giving some full public statement of the reasons why he is doing so, and I believe that the most appropriate form for that public statement would be the report of the inspector who has carried out the inquiry upon the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 43, line 28, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that in any case where it is represented to the Minister by any person affected by a draft scheme or order or by the local authority or joint committee responsible for the preparation or adoption of the draft scheme or order that the pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
posals thereof are of exceptional importance by reason of their magnitude or by reason of the questions of policy or principle raised thereby the Minister may cause the inquiry into the draft scheme or order to be held by a tribunal of three impartial and experienced persons who shall not be officials of any Government department."</p></blockquote>
The object of this proviso is to provide a special inquiry in cases of exceptional importance, but even in such cases the wording of the proviso leaves the question of whether such special inquiry should be set up or not entirely to the discretion of the Minister. During the course of the proceedings on this Bill I have sought on many occasions to impress on the Committee the magnitude of some of the schemes that are likely to be proposed and carried out under the Bill, especially in those districts of built-up areas. Some of the schemes are of enormous magnitude and involve large sums of money. I propose that the request may be made by the parties or the local authority interested, and the Minister himself would then be the sole judge of whether the issues were of sufficient importance to justify such a special tribunal. It might possibly be said that the Minister has already power to direct such an inquiry, but in my view it is very doubtful whether he has. If, however, he has, I think that it ought to be set out in the Bill in words somewhat similar to those of the Amendment. The words that I propose are to cover cases where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposals thereof are of exceptional importance by reason of their magnitude or by reason of the questions of policy or principle raised thereby the Minister may cause the inquiry into the draft scheme or order to be held by a tribunal of three impartial and experienced persons who shall not be officials of any Government department."</p></blockquote>
The words there set out are taken from the Scottish Procedure Act. As the Committee may be aware, Scottish Bills are now, instead of being brought in by Bill, brought into the House by Provisional Order; then, if the Chairman of Ways and Means is satisfied, in these words, that "by reason of the magnitude" of the issues raised in the Provisional Order, or "by reason of the questions of policy or principle raised thereby" they are of sufficient importance, he can say that the procedure should not be by Provisional Order but must be by Bill in the House of Commons in the regular way. I suggest to the Minister here, although the occasions might be very rare, that when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
the issues are very large or of great importance it might be to the advantage of his office to have this power of having an independent tribunal set up to investigate and make the report to him, instead of by a departmental officer in his own office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is undoubtedly the fact that from the first Clause to the last of this Bill the Minister is endued with enormous powers; he has to decide pretty well everything that has to be decided in this Bill, and I put it as much on the ground of assistance to him as to the parties concerned. It would give very much greater confidence to everybody in these cases where big issues are raised if there was a possibility of the matter being decided in this way. I do not propose to go into other Acts of Parliament where similar provisions have been included and inserted, but if the Minister wished it, I would tell him that from the Education Act of 1931, and from the Trade Board Acts of 1918, down to the Abnormal Imports Act of 1932, inquiries have been directed to be made by persons independent of any Government office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe I can meet my hon. and learned Friend upon this point. The powers that he proposes are purely permissive. As a matter of fact, the whole ground covered by his Amendment is already covered by powers possessed by the Ministry of Health. Therefore I do not think his Amendment would get us very much further. I would like to make a suggestion for his assistance. It would be well, if we are to deal with this matter, that the Minister has not only power to appoint somebody outside to hold the inquiry, but when that person is appointed he also has the necessary statutory powers to appoint an inspector, which will make the inquiry efficient. I propose to put the Amendment in a somewhat different form, which is to move in Clause 37, which I am told is the appropriate place, on Report, a new Sub-section to the following effect:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Minister shall have power with the consent of the Treasury to appoint a person to act for a period not exceeding 30 days as an inspector for the purpose of conducting any local inquiry under the Act and to confer on any person so appointed any of the powers conferred on an inspector of the Ministry of Health for the purpose of inquiries held under the Public Health Act, 1875."</p></blockquote>

My hon. and learned Friend may ask, Why only one? He suggests three. I am told that the answer is that under the Interpretation Act "one" also stands for many. A horse, so to speak, is a cow, and you can appoint many persons where you have power to appoint one. This would achieve his object in a fuller form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely satisfied with the form the Minister suggests, and I am obliged to him for meeting me in this way. He goes even a little further, because I only suggested this should apply in matters of exceptional importance where there were great questions of policy or of principle concerned.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) On the hearing of an appeal to quarter sessions under this Section any party to the appeal may appear by a solicitor instead of in person or by counsel."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is supported by a considerable number of other Members in this Committee. The object of the Amendment is simply to effect the cheapening of litigation. By reason of a decision in a case which was heard so long ago as 1847, barristers enjoyed the exclusive right of audience at Quarter Sessions. This right, however, was somewhat modified by the Rating and Valuation Act of 1925. The House of Commons in that Bill recognised that it was of benefit to property owners that they should be permitted to be represented at Quarter Sessions by solicitors if they so chose, rather than that they should be put to the additional expense of briefing counsel. It is perfectly true that by reason of the intervention of distinguished members of the Bar in the sanctuary of another place, there was some limitation placed upon this modification, and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
right of audience to solicitors was limited to those cases where the rateable value of hereditaments did not exceed Â£100. Even then, that was a compromise which was only very reluctantly accepted by the House of Commons. Since then, however, it is generally agreed that there has been a continuous and ever increasing demand for cheaper litigation, and I suggest that this Committee would be going a long way towards gratifying that very proper demand on the part of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the Amendment has already been accepted by both Houses of Parliament, and I think we should consider that this Town and Country Planning Bill being of such a far-reaching nature, there are bound to arise many cases of hardship under the operation of its provisions. Many of the people aggrieved will be people of moderate means who will be unable to afford an imposing array of counsel. I submit, therefore, that we should assist these people as far as possible by cheapening litigation and lessening to some extent the cost of their appeals to Quarter Sessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point. In a great many of these cases the proceedings before the court of summary jurisdiction will be conducted by a solicitor, and under the Clause as it stands any people who appeal to Quarter Sessions will be deprived of the advocacy of that solicitor who has, by reason of the conduct of the proceedings in the court of summary jurisdiction, obtained a very intimate knowledge of the whole facts of the case. I submit that we should not deprive appellants to Quarter Sessions of the services of a solicitor who has thus got an intimate knowledge of the details of the case. I urge the Committee to accept this Amendment and so help to some extent in cheapening litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not here, but I would venture to suggest that this is hardly a question that ought to be decided piecemeal. Either at Quarter Sessions counsel ought to have the sole right of audience that they have at the present time, or it ought to be decided in some general Act. It really is not proper business to take one special Act and separate the existing practice at Quarter Sessions. The hon. Member spoke of there being "an imposing array of counsel" in Quarter Sessions. I speak
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
here as Chairman of Quarter Sessionsâ€”I believe I am the only Chairman of Quarter Sessions in the House excepting the right hon. Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George)â€”and I can tell him that we do not have imposing arrays of counsel at Quarter Sessions. We generally have young, junior counsel who have recently started, and the expenses are not too severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not myself very conversant as to the extent of the number of cases likely to come before Quarter Sessions at all under this Bill. I think they are likely to be very few. I wish the hon. Member had mentioned the Sections under which there would be any appeal. Perhaps the Minister himself, who is more conversant with the Bill, would tell us. On the broad lines that if there is to be a limitation of the legal procedure at Quarter Sessions, I think that ought to be dealt with in a general Bill, an alteration of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, or something of that sort, rather than piecemeal by various Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman is this, that wherever there is an appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction in the Bill, that carries with it the right of appeal to the Court of Quarter Sessions. On the merits of the case, the Minister has considered it, and he feels that he must leave it to the decision of the Committee. I ought to point out that, of course, when this issue was raised on the Act to which he refers, the Rating and Valuation Act, it appeared in that Act limited to cases of Â£100. I think it only fair to the Committee to say that I do not think it would be as easy under this Bill to draw a monetary limit as it was in the case of the rating and valuation appellant's case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MOREING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support this Amendment. I admit that I am a qualified solicitor, although as I do not practise, I am more or less impartial on this matter. I am completely thrilled as a member of the junior branch of the profession at hearing the case so ably put by my hon. Friend the Member far Durham (Mr. McKeag). I am sure it is a matter of great regret to have tO disagree with the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), who occupies such an eminent place in the senior branch of the profession. I can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
see the strength of his argument that the question of general procedure at Quarter Sessions should be embodied in a general Judicature Act relating to the whole lot of the procedure in courts of law in this country. I really think, however, that here is a case where we might be able to make a preliminary step forward in the sense that has been indicated by the Mover of this Amendment. We know perfectly well, all of us who are acquainted with the every-day affairs of this world, that there is a constant complaint of the expensive nature of legal proceedings in this country. There have been cases quoted time and again with the proviso that counsel should be employed. Unfortunately, people who have appeared as litigants are not in the position to afford the fees that are demanded â€”rightly demanded and worthily earnedâ€”by the gentlemen of the long robe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that possibly my learned Friend the Attorney-General will quote various Acts of Parliament as the representative of the Courts of Justice. Under this Bill there is a danger that a certain amount of litigation and appeals may arise, and I think it would be very hard and cruel to people to suggest that when they are brought into these appeals, through no fault of their own, but because they have the misfortune, living under the present Government, to be owners of property, that they should have to get into these legal entanglements. I am greatly impressed by the views of the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead as to the danger of interfering with the general question of procedure at Quarter Sessions, but I hope the Committee will support this Amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary a moment ago referred to appeals under the Rating and Valuation Act. In connection with that, I want to point out that generally the senior branch of the legal profession are very tenacious of their rights, but after all a great amount of the legal work of this country is largely dealt with at Sessions and elsewhere by members of the junior branch of the profession, and I think that without doing any harm to the old-fashioned legal system of this country, we may carry the Amendment of the hon. Member for Durham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this Amendment, because there are so many
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
people who are now in the category of small property owners, and it is quite possible that at any time they may be forced, quite involuntarily perhaps, into acquiring the services of the legal profession. If, as is provided in the Bill, counsel is to be engaged, it is going to be a costly matter, and it is quite possible â€”one has seen it on many occasionsâ€”that rather than face the expense of costly litigation, they will surrender. I say that these small people should not be placed in that position. They surrender through fright of the cost with which they may be faced. Therefore, I submit that the reasons given against this Amendment by the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley) â€”that it is altering the procedure of legal practiceâ€”is not a justifiable one. I see no excuse for suggesting that some Act of Parliament should be introduced to deal with this matter generally. We are now dealing with is very important subject and one which will have a very wide influence and will require litigation at many stages of its operation, and I feel that, now that we have the opportunity, we should make this litigation as cheap as possible. For that reason, I support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CURRY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reinforce the arguments put forward in favour of this Amendment. Ever since we met in this Committee we have heard over and over again that it is the interests of the small property owners that are really being affected. We are passing a Bill which is going to codify the whole law of town and country planning, and in the course of that work we are bound to bring into relation with it the liberties of small owners whose only desire is to be left alone. We are affecting their interests, and I think it would not be right if we did not take every possible precaution to see that wherever they are brought in they are put to as little expense as possible in preserving their own rights. That is why I support this Amendment. It is because I feel that people will suffer injustice through not being able to defend their rights on account of not having sufficient wealth. I was greatly impressed by the words of the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), but while it affects the legal profession, it is also true that the interests of the legal profession will best
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
be consulted by committees of this sort expressing their opinion on matters of the kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee is entitled to the guidance of my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General on this question. I myself am torn as to which way to vote. I am impressed by the arguments of the hon. and learned Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley), and I think it is a serious thing to interfere with the position of the Bar in a matter of this kind. By doing so you may achieve results which are unexpected and more far-reaching than is contemplated. The proper course for those who support the Amendment is to vote against the Bill. The hon. Member for Southampton (Mr. Craven-Ellis) will probably do so. He fears that a very large number of small property owners will be affected by this Bill, some of whom will be involved in litigation. I think that all will be involved. The proper course is not so much to try to cheapen litigation as to take the more drastic and radical course of avoiding these risks altogether. I hope that on some later occasion my hon. Friends who have at last shown some tardy recognition of the effect of this Bill will implement their action in some way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather deliberately refrained from expressing an opinion on this question lest it might be thought that I was prejudiced or that I wished to dominate the decision of the Committee. I am not impressed by what was said by the hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Moreing) about the tenacious character of the members of what he calls the senior branch of the profession. They have certain privileges; he wants them, and he would be equally tenacious of them if he had them. If anybody, for instance, suggested that a secretary of a trade union should appear, nobody would be more tenacious than my hon. Friend of his privileges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MOREING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we have one great privilege in the junior branch of the profession; that is, we are able to instruct the members of the senior branch. I am a man of peace, though perhaps some who have been attending this Committee may not think so, but I am afraid that if we get on to the question of trade
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
unions and things of that sort, we are all treading on very dangerous ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what that has to do with what I was saying. I was saying that I am not impressed with the fact that the members of the Bar are against this proposal nor with what has been said as to the amount of litigation likely to arise out of this Bill. The same protest was made regarding an Act passed a few years ago about good will. There has been very little litigation under it. A number of people got their rights who never got them before. The Acts which lead to litigation are Acts which are framed very simply, like the Workmen's Compensation Act. Quite frankly, personally I am opposed to this reformâ€”if it can be called a reformâ€”because I think it will naturally open the door to the audience of solicitors at Quarter Sessions where at present they have not audience. There are a number of Quarter Sessions where solicitors have audience at the present time, but there are places where the questions that arise make it desirable that members of the Bar shall be available. If you open the door to solicitors at these Quarter Sessions, you will get a diminishing supply of members of the Bar attending there. Everybody knows that solicitors welcome the assistance of members of the other branch of the profession, not because they are more learned, but, generally speaking, they are more skilled in advocacy. Where counsel have the sole right of audience at Quarter Sessions, I think it desirable that that right should be continued. For these reasons I think it would be better not to open the door to solicitors in connection with this Bill at Quarter Sessions where they are at present excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is very much in the cheapness argument, because members of the Bar who attend at Quarter Sessions, although perhaps more skilled than others in advocacy and having perhaps a more specialised knowledge of the law, do not generally ask for a generous fee, and it is possible to employ them without costing the client more than a solicitor would cost him if the solicitor appeared alone. A solicitor, it is true, has not to pay counsel's fee, but he has a fee which he charges for instructing and appearing himself, and I do not think there would be very much difference when the bill was totted up at the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard now from both sides of the legal profession what their views are, and I am appealing to the Committee to pass the Amendment from the point of view of a layman. The reason I do so is that this Bill is permissive. It is going to get people into the hands of the local authorities. That is bad enough. Then they are going to be put into the hands of solicitors. That is worse. And it would be worse still if we had counsel added. I hope the Amendment will be passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir M. MANNINGHAM-BULLER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not much moved by the remarks of the last speaker. This is a Town and Country Planning Bill, and whether this proposal is desired or undesired is not a matter to be dealt with in one Clause of a Bill which deals with town and country planning. If such a reform is necessary in the courts of law, it requires more consideration than we can give it here now, and if we discuss it, we are opening up a very dangerous field, which requires more discussion. That matter should be dealt with in a Bill dealing with procedure in our courts of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McKEAG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to dispose of the impression which is being created by various speakers that this is some remarkable innovation which should not be dealt with by this Committee at all, but be left to some other body to decide. This principle has already been accepted. If I may, I will read out the Clause which was inserted in the Rating and Valuation Act of 1925, which is as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the hearing of an appeal by a committee of quarter sessions under this Section any party to the appeal may, if the rateable value of the hereditament to which the appeal relates as appearing in the valuation list does not exceed one hundred pounds, appear by solicitor instead of in person or by counsel."</p></blockquote>
So that there is not any innovation about this. The principle has already been accepted, so there is a precedent for this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>There need be no compunction on the part of Members of this Committee in accepting this Amendment. The effect of the Amendment, in spite of what the learned Attorney-General says, is to cheapen litigation, and anyone who has had experience in these matters knows that the employment of counsel has the effect of increasing the cost of litigation. It is in the interests of economy that I urge that this Amendment should be accepted.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was on the Committee that dealt with the Act of 1925, and I think it was specially laid down that we could not extend the law because it was limited to Â£100. Large sums might be involved. The argument of the hon. and gallant Member for Northampton (Sir M. Manningham-Buller) does seem an accurate one, and it is desirable to alter the law in this respect. In 1925 that was done in a very limited degree under the guidance of the Minister of Health, and we did not think we were taking a great risk. I do not think it would be competent for this Committee to decide a dispute between two trade unions, and it would be wrong for this Committee to interfere in such a matter. I am ruled by the argument put forward by the hon. and gallant Member for Northampton that in a case like this we should leave the law as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"nor to the use of any land acquired before the passing of this Act by a company incorporated for the purpose of developing such land for industrial purposes in conjunction with a statutory company constituted for the express purpose of serving such land with railway facilities."</p></blockquote>
I will make my remarks very short, and I hope, as soon as he has opened his papers, the hon. Member for Hulme (Sir J. Nall), in whose name the Amendment stands on the Paper, will make a more moving appeal than I can on this point. The point was raised by Mr. Oliver a year ago on Clause 4. It was then understood that the then Minister of Health, the right hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Greenwood), was sympathetically disposed and would insert words which would meet the case. That view was strengthened by his remarks in Committee, because, in reply to the hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Womersley), the right hon. Member for Wakefield explained that the second part of this Clause was designed to deal with rather miscellaneous kinds of
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
undertakings of which the Trafford Park Estates Company, to which the hon. Member for Blackley (Mr. Lees-Jones) referred recently, is an example. It seems to me that, if that was the intention, the Department completely failed to achieve the object that they had in view, and I do not think there is very much danger in accepting this Amendment now proposed, which will in effect bring in industrial development companies such as the Trafford Park Estates Company, because I would point out to my right hon. Friend the very material limitations which are set out in the Amendment which we ask him to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that these companies have to be incorporated before the passing of the Act. The second is that they must be companies which are developing land primarily, or rather entirely, for industrial purposes. The third, which narrows them down still more, is that they must work in conjunction with a statutory company which is providing railway facilities. It is quite obvious that the number of such areas must be very, very small indeed; in fact, the only other one which I happen to know of, though there are doubtless others, is one in Nottingham. I do not myself see what arguments can well be adduced for making this exception. I am told, though it is not on first-hand information, that in the case of the Trafford Park Estate an arterial road has been planned diagonally, and I am told a similar road is to cross the Aintree estate. But if a company like the Trafford Park Estate, which has gone into the question of industrial development in a way that no town committee ever will or can do, is to have all its plans set aside, all its projects brought to nought, because some corporations or representatives of corporations decide that the area is one which ought to be developed in another way, surely it is not a Measure to expedite development but to hinder it. Again, if this Bill is really one for development and is designed to promote and not hinder the proper progress of industry, this is an Amendment which should commend itself to my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOSEPH NALL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my right hon. Friend will be able to intimate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
acceptance of this Amendment, and I am grateful to my hon. and gallant Friend for moving it when I was not ready at the moment. This matter was raised when the Bill was previously before the House, and I understand that the Minister of that time did indicate his view that something should be done to meet cases such as the Trafford Park Estate, to which my hon. and gallant Friend has referred, and words were added to the Bill on that occasion. But they did not apparently quite cover the case, and this draft, standing in my name on the Paper, is intended to carry out what it was understood the Minister on the previous occasion was willing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not add much to what my hon. and gallant Friend has said on the merits of the Trafford Park case. The Committee will be aware that that is a considerable estate which has been developed almost wholly as an industrial area, though some part of it has not yet been taken up. One of the objections which seem to us to be raised against the machinery of the present Bill is that as the industrial revival takes place and the demand for sites begins to be felt, the machinery of this Bill may be a hindrance. In the particular case of Trafford Park, here is an area which, at this stage of development, could hardly be used for any other purpose than the industrial scheme for which it is laid out; and, if any part of it is required for arterial road purposes, in that case it could be met. But there are cases where it is wholly undesirable and against the industrial requirements of the district that a large area should be held in suspense against the day when some scheme might be drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some schemes have been talked of, most extravagant schemes, in the Manchester area, involving an expenditure of millions, schemes which have not any prospect of being carried out. It is therefore desirable to meet, a special case like this, where considerable capital has been spent; where roads for the service of the estate already exist and have been in use for some years; where railway sidings amounting to many miles in length are actually in use; where, in fact, it is not a case of some speculator jumping in in the hope of huge profits,
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
but where there is development going on. My hon. Friend intimated that there is another comparable case near Nottingham; I do not profess to be very closely informed on that matter, but I understand that it is another similar instance where some special provision should be made in this Bill to avoid its otherwise useful provisions being inadvertently used to obstruct industrial progress. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given very full consideration to those aspects of the case which my hon. and gallant Friend suggested, but possibly he will come to the conclusion, on considering the scheme of safeguards in the Bill as it now stands, that a company in the position of the Trafford Park Estate is very fully safeguarded in all its legitimate interests of the sort, and in particular by that final review in Parliament. I know that Members of the Committee may think to themselves: "Well, that does not often happen, that appeal to Parliament against the provisions of a scheme." But, as I mentioned at the time, what we all laid great stress on was the inhibitory effect of that review of the scheme in Parliament in protecting such big public interests as that which is in the hands of the Trafford Park Estate. That being so, is it necessary to make any such provision as is set out in this Amendment? I do not think it is, nor that it would be right to do so. I do not think that it would be right to insert a special Clause dealing with a particular company.

Let me pay my full tribute, on this occasion, as Minister of Health, to the work that is being done by the Trafford Park Estate on development in the public interest, but it is different in character from that of the statutory companies which the Clause is intended to cover and must cover. The Bill must cover those companies, because they have a statutory obligation to carry out, and, Parliament having imposed upon them a statutory obligation to provide some public service, no subsequent Bill must come along and do anything which could possibly interfere with their discharge of that statutory obligation. That is the distinction between those companies and the particular case. I fail to find anything which would distinguish the Trafford Park Estate, with their excel-

lent work, from the other general case, and I am convinced that the provisions which we have now included in the Bill for the protection of the interests to which my hon. and gallant Friend refers are adequate, and that in those circumstances he will see his way not to press this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning my right hon. and learned Friend opposite successfully resisted an Amendment which we moved by saying that there could scarcely be any need for it, because no friendly societies or insurance companiesâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Building societies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: â€”no building societies or insurance companies had made representations. In this case it is quite clear that there have been representations. Hon. Members will have realised that the management of the Trafford Park Estate are very seriously concerned indeed at the prospects which this Clause, unamended, might mean to them. Their view isâ€”and I do not think it is an exaggerated or unreasonable viewâ€”that the very highly specialised development that they are carrying out might be seriously interfered with, especially considering what happened before, and how the Minister of Health was specially prepared to meet this case. I think that it is very regrettable that my right hon. Friend cannot accept this Amendment. The Trafford Park people are extremely skilful at town planning, and ought not to be interfered with by municipal authorities, even if these bodies were going to do one-fifth as well as I believe they actually are. I was very powerfully impressed, when I was there, by the high degree of skill shown in laying out the estate, and by its extreme efficiency viewed as an industrial undertaking. The management feel that their position is seriously endangered by this Bill, and there is no doubt that if certain schemes which are in the air now came to pass, the whole Trafford Park undertaking might be very seriously jeopardised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we should insert this Amendment. It could only have a very limited effect, but it could make certain that no body of enthusiasts could have
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
it in their power to drive some main arterial highway or some pathway right across the Trafford Park Estate in a way which would seriously interfere with its working, which depends on having railway sidings along all the roads. It is a point of real substance; we want to avoid not so much that things shall be done as that an atmosphere of uncertainty shall be created which will make those people feel that their undertaking is no longer theirs to manage in the extremely efficient way in which they have managed it in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's regret that the Minister cannot accept the Amendment. I confess that I cannot see, and I could not learn from my right hon. Friend's reply, what harm he thought this Amendment could possibly do from his point of view. There is no question that it will do a great deal of good from ours. We cannot share his apparently sublime and blissful confidence in the good intentions and capabilities of the local authorities. We know from bitter experiences in the past that they do not do this work particularly well, and that there have been innumerable cases where schemes of private development have been spoilt by the muddle-headed actions of local authorities. The principle of this Bill is to get good planning, and where we have good planned developments we want a safeguard that no stupid or vicious local authority shall come and interfere with it. I cannot see that there is any company that would be covered by this Amendment which is not already doing its work well and properly. We know that the fear exists, as my Noble Friend has said, and I think that it will have a most unfortunate effect on the Trafford Park Company if this Amendment is rejected and the Bill goes through without it. The management do not feel they have adequate safeguards, and I hope that the Committee will see its way to inserting an Amendment, which, after all, will only ensure that when the work which this Bill seeks to promote is being done well, no outside person shall come in and interfere with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel SANDEMAN ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 45, line 8, after the word "more," to insert the words "competent and impartial."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the names attached to this Amendment. The hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Moreing) is the Port of London Authority; the hon. Member for Salisbury (Major Despencer-Robertson) is the Mersey Dock and Harbour Board; the hon. Member for the Cathcart Division of Glasgow (Mr. Train)â€”I might call him a Clydesider, but I do not like to do so in his absence!â€”is the Clyde Trust; and the hon. Member for the Hulme Division of Manchester (Sir J. Nall) is the Manchester Ship Canal. So you have interests representing the various statutory authorities. The Amendment is to insert the words "competent and impartial" in Clause 40. You will see that the Clause is quite clear, and that what it asks for is that, if the decision has to be made, the Minister shall appoint a competent and impartial person to make that decision. The Minister has accepted the principle in Clause 37, and I hope that he will be able to see his way to help us with this Amendment. I may say that I hope that he looks upon me somewhat as his curly-haired, blue-eyed boy after the way in which I have helped him on previous occasions!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We who have borne the brunt of the fray on this side and have carried the poor man's banner are rather shocked to find my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for West Birkenhead (Lieut.-Colonel Sandeman Allen) now coming out blatantly as a spokesman for vested interests. I do not think that he is likely to be the Minister's blue-eyed boy. His Amendment seeks to get, not one of the Minister's own particular blue-eyed boys from his own Department, but somebody "competent and impartial." One stays in the House
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
of Commons and one learns many things, and the last Sittings of this Committee have been as instructive as the first. I hope that, at any rate on the grounds my hon. Friend mentioned, the Minister will not accept this Amendment, whether or not he has good grounds of another sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The ATTORNEY-GENERAL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was rather hard on my hon. and gallant Friend that, after his touching appeal to the Minister to reward him for his good conduct, he should find himself seconded by my hon. and gallant Friend opposite. It spoilt the whole effect of his appeal. But I hope that both my hon. and gallant Friends will feel that the procedure in the Bill gives the railway people and other similar undertakings ample safeguards. I cannot help recalling an old legal story about a man who was wished by a good friend an impartial judge. He said: "I don't want an impartial judge, I want a partial one!" I venture to think that the Bill provides for the impartial judge, and that you are much less likely to get a partial one than if this Amendment were put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not attach any importance to the word "competent." The word "competent" is in my hon. Friend's own Amendment; it is not the Bill's word. I do not think that it really adds anything at all to it. I do not think my hon. Friend suggests that the people who will consider it under the joint appointment of the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport are not competent. I am quite certain my hon. Friends have no, reflection of that sort to make upon the persons who are likely to be jointly appointed by these two Ministers. What is really sought to say is that he shall be an impartial person who shall be supposed to be free from any disposition at all in favour of one side or the other, as also does the later Amendmentâ€”" not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
in the employment of any Government department." inasmuch as these persons are to be appointed by the Minister of Health and by the Minister of Transport acting jointly, I venture to think you will get a truly impartial person and one who is just as likely to lean to one side as to the other. Whereas if you put into the Bill that you are to have an impartial person, it means a person who is not known to have any partiality, and you are much more likely to get a person who will lean to one side or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it can have been fully appreciated by my hon. Friends that in the proviso which they are seeking to amend, there is to be a sort of round table conference between the persons who are appointed by the two Ministers mostly concerned, one of whom may be expected to have a special interest in town planning, the other of whom may be expected to have a special interest in the transport undertakers. They jointly nominate or appoint one or more persons. You will get the railway companies or the undertakers coming to sit round the table with these people and discuss whether it is reasonable or unreasonable that consent should be given. Let us suppose that the rather more formal procedure is adopted of appointing somebody who is described as "competent." I am glad my hon. Friends have put that in, from their point of view. It is to be an impartial person. You will have a tribunal then, something much more formal than the round table conference which I have suggested. It will certainly be more expensive. I venture to think my hon. and gallant Friend will have secured nothing except a little additional expense, a little more formality, and a rather more prolonged proceeding than if somebody from the Government Department was there to talk the matter over with his two arbitrators, as it wereâ€”one from the Ministry of Health, one from the Ministry of Transportâ€”and perhaps one or two other colleagues appointed with himself, and the people who wish to make the suggestions in their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remember, this is not a question of judicial proceeding. There is no question to be decided except this question as to whether the consent has been reasonably or unreasonably withheld and what conditions ought to be attached to the granting of consent. When you want
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
to get an impartial person is when you have a question to be decided by advocacy and by arguments and all the rest of it. This is merely a way of securing that before the question is determined about the consent which may not be unreasonably withheld, you shall have an opportunity of talking the matter over with certain persons who have been specially appointed by the two Ministers from the Government Departments to discuss the matter in all its bearings. I do hope my hon. and gallant Friend will not press this Amendment, because it will only mean much more formality, much more expense, and a great deal of prolongation of the proceedings, because the impartial person will be presumably somebody who does not know anything at all about the subject and is on virgin soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let this round table conference proceed as the proviso proposes, and I think you will find that there will be, even if you are thinking of the interests of the transport undertakers, a leaning to the interests of the transport undertakers rather more than if you got the impartial person, who very likely when he comes to hold the inquiry may turn out to have a great many preconceived notions which were quite unknown to the Minister. I doubt very much whether you can get competent and impartial persons. If by "impartial" you mean somebody who has no ideas on the subject, he is very likely to be incompetent. If you have a competent person, you will probably have somebody who knows something about this subject and starts off with a certain amount of information on the matter. I am sure my hon. and gallant Friend's experience in life leads him to think that. I doubt if you could get any competent and impartial person to satisfy my hon. and gallant Friend's conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MOREING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the hon. and gallant Member for Birkenhead West (Lieut.-Colonel Sandeman Allen wishes to press this Amendment, but I think I am entitled to say a few words, as my name appears on the Paper. My hon. Friend referred to the position I have the honour to hold on the Port of London Authority, a position of great honour and great responsibility. He referred to the fact that Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and London are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
concerned in this Amendment. I will also remind him that Preston is a very important port too. The Mayor of Preston, when he goes to church in state, has the regalia carried before him, and among that regalia is a silver oar as a symbol of this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The learned Attorney-General lent the full weight of his forensic ability to give the Committee very good reasons indeed why this Amendment should not be accepted and why it is unnecessary. He said the Amendment was rather badly worded, and he brought to bear the whole of his ability on the fact that we had used the word "competent," a wholly unnecessary word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must agree with the learned Attorney-General on any question of legal interpretation, but I am amazed, with the utmost respect to the Attorney-General, when he deprecates the introduction of the word " competent," which the House of Commons and another place for years past have been making use of in legislation. It is not as if the hon. and gallant Member for Birkenhead West and myself, after much burning of midnight oil and tying of wet towels round our heads had suddenly produced a new formula, which would justly lay my hon. Friend and myself open to attack from the learned Attorney-General. The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901, passed, I believe, by a Conservative Government, stated that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may appoint a competent person to hold an inquiry."</p></blockquote>
The Trades Board Act of 1918 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may appoint a competent person"â€”</p></blockquote>
not competent and impartial. If the Attorney-General is not content, we will now go on. In the Ministry of Transport Act of 1919, Second Schedule, the Minister may appoint:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a competent and impartial person to hold an inquiry."</p></blockquote>
The Attorney-General still shakes his head and believes the hon. and gallant Member and myself have gone into this matter without careful consideration. Under the Unemployed Insurance Act of 1920â€”I am not certain that that was the prolific father of so many children in 1920:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may appoint a competent and impartial person to hold an inquiry with regard to any draft special order."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
A change of mind came over Parliament in 1921, when the Education Act of that year, in the Fifth Schedule, decided not to go into the question of competency, but to have an impartial person. The Cinematograph Films Act of 1922 decided to go back to having a competent person rather than an impartial one. In the Oil in Navigable Waters Act of 1922 Parliament in its wisdom decided to go in for fresh phraseology and decided to approve of "competent and independent persons." Finally, the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1920 said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person agreed upon between the two parties should be appointed an arbitrator."</p></blockquote>
This is not a matter of very great importance, but I feel, with the utmost respect, that it is time the private Member of Parliament got up and defended the wisdom of Parliament in the past with its accumulated experience of years of passing legislation, against the rash and rather unfair attack of the Attorney-General. I hope my hon. and gallant Friend will press his Amendment and that we shall say that Parliament has not been wrong in all these past years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask for a. few words of explanation as to the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority or joint committee propose to include in a scheme any land which is situate within the prescribed distanceâ€¦"</p></blockquote>
Are those distances already prescribed, or is the Minister at the moment this Bill becomes law to prescribe distances? The description of the word "prescribe" means to prescribe:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with the Commissioners of Works."</p></blockquote>
I believe there is in the definition Clause a further description, which in effect says exactly the same thing. When a local authority wishes to prepare a scheme,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
say, in the neighbourhood of Windsor Park, has it to go to the Minister, who will say what are the prescribed distances? Where the road from Windsor to Staines crosses Windsor. Great Park-1 assume that all the houses on the main road are private propertyâ€”does it mean that they are to have a tussle with the First Commissioner of Works as well as with the Minister of Health? I am perfectly certain we should all desire to maintain reasonable amenities, but nobody has yet discovered the exact and precise meaning of the word "amenity." It may spoil the amenity of Windsor Great Park to see a gasometer 20 miles away. Can we have some assurance that it will only mean something a little nearer at hand? I really rise to ask what the procedure is, what is the prescribed distance, and when it is going to be prescribed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reply to my hon. Friend, the Member for Guildford (Mr. Rhys) is in Sub-section (2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Section, 'prescribed' means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with the Commissioners of Works."</p></blockquote>
The intention of the regulation is to find a reasonable limit, a limit wide enough to include any land which could reasonably be affected, or alterations which could reasonably have an effect upon the Royal park. The effect of the regulations will always be to maintain that reasonable limit. It could not possibly come to such an extravagant extension as the one referred to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand there are going to be 	<i>ad hoc</i> regulations for this scheme? The minute this Bill is passed are the Minister and the First Commissioner of Works going to decide in each place on its merits what the regulations are to be? It seems to me a matter of some substance. If you are lucky enough to be within the prescribed regulations, you might get off some of the regulations in this Bill. We have decided that "competent" and "impartial" have no place in itâ€”as was very properâ€”and I do not think we can have anything quite so arbitrary as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
