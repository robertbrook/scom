	<p>Amendment proposed [16th February, 1932]: In page 2, line 7, to leave out the words "county districts," and to insert instead thereof the word "counties."—[	<i>Mr. M. Beaumont.</i>]</p>
	<p>Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MICHAEL BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw this Amendment in order to substitute an Amendment to leave out the words "county districts" and to insert the words "of counties and boroughs."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 7, to leave out the words "county districts," and to insert instead thereof the words " of counties and boroughs."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this change is to include non-county boroughs as well as county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will reject all these Amendments. Before we decide to deprive small local authorities of their powers, it is incumbent on those who support this proposal to show us that small authorities have not worked the Town Planning Act well since 1909, when this power was given them. 1909 is not a very popular year for those who live in the country districts, because it saw the introduction of a Budget which, we consider, has ruined the countryside. I hope that the Minister of Health, whose mind has broadened since the days when he sup-
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
ported the Budget of the right hon. Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, who sang with such gusto in the local Hallelujah chorus that famous song "God gave the Land to the People," will listen to the representations of those who speak for the smaller local authorities. I am amazed that the hon. and gallant Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Clifton Brown) wants to give power to the Minister to decide whether it shall be the local council or the county council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HENRY CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I entirely support the hon. and gallant Member, but on the question of the withdrawal of this Amendment, would it not be better to deal with that matter first? We shall have to discuss the proposed Amendment afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee, I understood, agreed to the withdrawal of the Amendment, and we have now a fresh Amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we were discussing the principle of all these Amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are, and that is how the matter stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the question now before the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment before the Committee is to leave out the words "county districts" and to substitute the words "of counties or boroughs." I understand that the Committee has agreed to the withdrawal of the original Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I was mistaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these proposed Amendments are carried, rural district councils will be penalised; and I want to put in a word for them. In the past they have looked after their districts and preserved the amenities quite as well as larger authorities. The hon. and gallant Member for Salisbury (Major Despencer-Rdbertson) is in favour of county councils having power over district councils, as though they were more careful and looked after the historical amenities of the country better. A county council which is a vandal in this respect is the county council of Wiltshire, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
they have deliberately ruined one of the features of the county—the Bath Road. County councils do not realise all the beauties of the county, because they are largely guided by the advice of experts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major DESPENCER-ROBERTSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what would happen if rural district councils have this power. These evils would occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I differ entirely from the hon. and gallant Member. If local district councils have this power, these questions will be considered by men who know the locality. Members of county councils are very busy and find it difficult to attend all committees; and these questions are, therefore, largely in the hands of experts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General CLIFTON BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member for St. Albans (Lieut.-Colonel Fremantle) is very keen on experts, and says that the Bill must not be opposed, because the experts want it. There is not much difference between an expert and a crank, except that a crank is a term of abuse used by one expert about another. If we are to safeguard the beauties of the countryside, and develop it properly, we must not overburden the county councils or the borough councils, nor must we take the work away from the small local authorities. I supported enthusiastically Poor Law reform and the Local Government Act, 1929, because I thought it was necessary to put into the hands of county councils the large local services, but if you are going to take away from district councils one of the most interesting bits of work they have to do, you are going to have this result: People will say, "What is the object of going on to the district council? There is no work to do," and, in addition, you will overburden the county council. It is difficult to-day to get the right people on county councils, because it is a whole-time job. For all these reasons, and as one who lives in and loves the countryside, I hope that the Committee will resist the attempt to take away from the smaller local authorities work which they have done so well in the past and
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
which they can do equally well in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will reject the Amendment. Rural district councils and urban district councils naturally are opposed to it. Under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, councils and borough authorities are the town-planning authority, the county councils were not included, but they came into the picture owing to the passage of the Local Government Act, 1929, which made them the road authority for small rural areas. There are several difficulties in this matter. Take the question of housing schemes. Builders have been accustomed to submit their plans to the district council, and it is rather difficult to require a district council, before approving the plans, to submit them to another council. It would be a little confusing to allow two authorities to prepare a scheme for the same area. District councils may have made considerable progress with their plans, and it would be creating a cause of conflict if you included county councils, which have taken very little interest in town planning, and super-imposed them on district councils as the superior authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Town Planning generally affects not only buildings but roads, and in planning roads there is a considerable advantage in bringing local knowledge and local initiative into play. This could best be done by treating the district council as the authority. It is suggested that arterial roads are best planned by leaving out the district councils, because the county councils are the bigger authorities, but there is not sufficient evidence to show that the county councils would be the better authority for dealing with arterial roads. There is no reason for making a change at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another item which influences me is the fact that if this matter is to be handed over completely to the county councils, it is possible that there will be no town planning at all. I am referring especially to the proposal which has been mooted, that the power should be vested in the hands of the county councils except in the case of urban districts of over 20,000 population. I understand that the first town planning scheme was proposed by an urban district with a population
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
of 16,000. If we are to eliminate the smaller urban districts from the Bill we shall eliminate the very kind of local authority which could give us good and efficient town planning schemes. Summing up the pros and cons, it seems to me that while there are points which may be argued in favour of the county councils—there are efficient county councils just as there are efficient local district councils—I think the balance is in favour of leaving the matter, as the Minister proposes, in the hands of the district councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. PRICE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the Amendment, but I am not going to argue about the efficiency of county councils or rural district councils, or which is the best authority. I view the Amendment from the point of view as to what will be calculated to get the best out of the general principles for which the Bill is framed. I am serving now on a rural council, and have been a member of a rural council for 20 years. I have been on a county council for 15 years. Therefore, I have some idea of the efficiency of each type of authority. Our experience in Yorkshire is, I am sure, not different from that of the country generally, in that we find on the county councils and on the district councils men who do their very best to administer the social laws in the best way affecting their particular areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want to get the best out of the Bill for the town planning of the various county districts, including industrial and rural areas, it would be a mistake if we accepted the Amendment and ruled out some very large urban and rural districts. In the area of my rural district council, there is a parish of 20,000. Therefore, it is not fair to view rural councils as having no status and no population. It would be a great mistake to rule out the right of these districts to a voice in the administration of the Act. In future town planning it is very essential to bring into consultation the rural and the urban district councils, particularly if we are to make the Act a success. Future town planning affects the existing social amenities of both urban and rural districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the county authority or the Minister thought there was need for cooperation in connection with the larger and wider issues of town planning in a county, I think the rural and urban
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
councils would be willing and ready to give their co-operation and the best advice as affecting their own area. There is provision for that in the Bill. In the interests of future town planning, although I know the capabilities of the county councils and am fully aware of their efficiency, I think that it would be risky to rule out the right of the smaller authorities to a voice in this matter. I do not think there is any reason to rule them out. If we are seeking the best for the future town planning of the counties as a whole, it is essential to get an expression of opinion from the people in the smaller rural districts, as well as in the counties and county boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee carry the Amendment, it will mean that not only will the rural districts and the urban districts be deprived of the additional powers to be given by the Bill but of the existing powers that they are already exercising under the 1925 Act. To that extent this is a disfranchising Bill, going back on what has been done. Since last Tuesday I have had very strong protests from the urban and rural district councils in my Division against these powers being taken out of their hands. The East Grinstead Division of Sussex is one which suffers from the evil at which this Bill is aimed perhaps as much as any other Division in the country, but I regret the extent of some of the additional powers that have been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The urban and rural district councils have managed their housing arrangements well all over the country. They have been entrusted with these powers, and they are particularly well acquainted with the needs of their districts. If we hand the powers over to the county councils, we shall put them into the hands of bodies who are not acquainted to the same degree with the local needs of the districts. In a large county like mine, the county of Sussex, we should feel that very strongly. The county councils are so overwhelmed with work that we have the greatest difficulty in finding people to go on thtm. I make this statement—although I am not prepared to give chapter and verse for it, but I believe it is true—that the county councils on the whole do not desire to have these powers entrusted to them. I am certain that with the amount of work that has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
to be done, this particular work is in no way likely to be done as well by the county councils as by the people immediately concerned—the people who live in the urban and rural districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 35, power is given in the Bill to enforce its provision and to take the matter out of the hands of authorities who are reluctant to proceed. In the case of the smaller authorities with populations of under 20,000, the Minister can, do the work himself. Therefore, the objection which I had on Tuesday is met by the later Clause in the Bill, namely, that some of the local authorities were so small that they would not be desirous of, or interested in, putting the Act into operation. For these reasons, and for the special reason that I think it is desirable to entrust as much power to the locality as we possibly can, I strongly urge the Minister to stick to the words in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHRISTIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member for Louth (Lieut. -Colonel Heanage) alluded to the powers granted to the county councils under the Local Government Act, in Sections 40 and 45. Does this Bill in any way interfere with those powers? They are very valuable powers for the county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of HEALTH (Sir Hilton Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to my hon. Friend is that the powers to which he refers under the previous Act are reenacted in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clear from the minds of the Committee a serious misapprehension as to the scope and purpose of the Amendment. Hon. Members have spoken as if the idea of the Amendment was to rule rural authorities entirely out of the picture. Nothing is further from the intention of the Amendment or of the subsequent Amendment to the second portion of Clause 2. Obviously—I do not think anyone will deny it—the details of town planning will have to be worked out by the smaller authorities on the spot. Our object is to put the initiative into the hands of the wider authority, the county council. Hon. Members have spoken about the Town Planning Act, 1909. The very date of that Act and the Government under which it was passed fail to commend themselves to me. Town planning has
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
advanced since 1909. The object of this Bill is to extend town planning to everywhere in England. If we are going to extend town planning all over the country, we must start our scheme with a wide basis and scope. We must have a broad outlook in the original plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the Amendment is to give the county councils the power to survey the whole county, and then to urge the rural and urban district councils to plan out their localities in accordance with the broad scheme. In the unfortunate cases, which do exist, where the rural district council and the county council are not on very good terms, there is the danger that the rural district council may get out a town plan suitable enough in its own area, but entirely unsuitable; for the needs of the county as a whole. That is what I want to prevent. I have deliberately not included the county boroughs with the county councils, because that is a different proposal—it is a distinction between town and country planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am willing to accept any suitable alteration of the Amendment, because I am not wedded to the particular words, but I do seriously urge upon the Minister the view that the larger authority should be the central authority, delegating its powers, compulsorily if necessary, to the smaller authorities to work out the details. I am sure that is the right way to go about it, and I am certain that he will get much better results if he adopts that line. The whole trend of modern legislation has been in that direction. Under the Local Government Act, 1929, the alteration in the powers regarding the roads has, most people will agree, operated most admirably. It was done in exactly the same way that I suggest. The viewpoint of the smaller authorities was, of necessity, too restricted to allow them to take the broad outlook which, in the first place, is necessary. There is the further point which I put on the previous Amendment on Tuesday, a point of considerable substance, that, notwithstanding the difficulty to which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Sir H. Cautley) alluded, namely, that it is difficult to get people to go on the county councils in Sussex, it is on the county councils as a whole that you find the people best qualified to undertake this work.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
[An HON. MEMBER: "Why?"] I did not think that that would seriously be challenged. I have served on both, but only, of course, in one area. I think that, on the whole, it is upon county councils rather than upon rural district councils that you find people with greater interest and knowledge in this kind of work. That statement, I admit, is open to challenge. It has been my experience and the experience of many other people. I quite accept that circumstances with regard to local authorities vary all over the country, but that is my opinion, and I think that it will be substantiated in fact. Finally—and this is a point which is now no longer of such great importance—there is the danger of the small independent rural district council. Although I am not going into the merits touched upon by various Members as to whether the county council is worse than the rural council, or vice versa, I think that a bad rural district council is worse than any county council can ever be. The county council has money with which to employ the best advisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and gallant Friend asks, "Whose money?" His money. The county council is able to employ the best people to get out its schemes. With regard to the bad rural district council, my hon. and learned Friend suggested that this point is covered by powers later on in the Bill. I agree, but it is our hope and intention, if not to eliminate, very greatly to limit those powers when we come to that part of the Bill, and I hope that when the Bill emerges from the Committee the need for that safeguard will no longer exist. Therefore, I would sooner put in a definite safeguard now. For all these reasons I believe, and those who think with me believe, that it is better that county councils should have the initial power, and then should pass on the details to the smaller local councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with many of the objections submitted by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Beaumont), I cannot support the Amendment. I appreciate that there are many rural authorities which are not inclined to progress with the times, and also that there is some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
times prejudice between one local authority and another. Although there are these objections, I feel that it is essential that the local knowledge and experience should be maintained. In fact, it is the local knowledge upon which a district can better be planned. I want to see that when a rural authority decides to town plan, the scheme should not proceed without the closest co-operation with the county council. I should like to see the county council made the planning authority, but in no way to take away completely the powers from the rural and other authorities within the county area. The reason why I feel that the county is the better planning authority is in consequence of an observation which was made by the Minister of Health at our first meeting. It was that he wanted to broaden the basis and desired to secure co-ordination throughout the country. I believe that such co-ordination can better be established through the county council than through a multiple of small authorities. But on no account would I support any proposal to rob the local authorities entirely of their powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUM0NT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment does not do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I maintain that the Amendment does take away those powers. We have this fact to bear in mind. We hope that, as a result of the policy of the National Government, there will be prosperity again in industry, and from what we thave had of town planning during the last two years, there is undoubtedly in the minds of the people a definite desire to proceed with this movement. Upon the prosperity which, I sincerely hope, will arise, I believe that town planning will move with greater rapidity, and for that reason I wish to see the machinery which will carry out town planning built up as efficiently as possible, and that there will be established between the authorities throughout the country that co-ordination and co-operation which are so essential in order to get the large unit of efficient town planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MOREING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the Amendment which has been moved by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Beaumont), because one can urge upon the Committee the fact that an Amendment of this nature to substitute county
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
councils for the local authority is a step in the right direction. We suffer from the multiplicity of local councils and small authorities more than from anything else. Anyone acquainted with public life in the country knows how difficult it is to get things carried through upon a large scale, because there are so many interests to be considered by the local authorities. The hon. and gallant Member for Thornbury (Captain Gunston), in his eloquent plea for the rural district councils, really could have put up equally as good a case as to the fitness of county councils to do this work. I could not follow his attack upon the Amendment, because he said that if we hand over these duties to the county council, the county councillors will not have sufficient knowledge of the facts and will fall into the hands of experts and be guided by them. I would like to ask the hon. and gallant Member, whether smaller authorities do not also employ experts and in some cases are guided by them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, they employ experts, but when a local district council is considering a town planning scheme, every member of the district council knows the particular part of the county. When a county council has to go into the matter, its members cannot know the particular part of the county, and must rely upon experts. They are busy doing other jobs, and will never be able to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MOREING</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, came from a county, and I am afraid that I must disagree with the hon. and gallant Member. Small local authorities would be more under the thumb of the so-called expert than would be the larger 'authority. I think that his fears in that respect are groundless. I would strongly echo what the hon. Member for Aylesbury said. Let us look at the thing in a bigger light from the county point of view. It is all very well to say that the local district council have local knowledge of their own condition. Surely, you cannot look at it from the point of view of a small local authority, but from the point of view of, say, the home counties of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. The hon. and gallant Member for St. Albans (Lieut.-Colonel Fremantle) 'at the last sitting pointed out the serious dangers which confront the Home Counties by the ex-
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
tension of London pushing out more and more into such counties as Hertfordshire and Surrey. Surely, it would be better to have a town-planning scheme for Hertfordshire, and for the local authorities in Hertfordshire to work in conjunction with the county council in the matter. We made a great step forward in this country under the Local Government Act, 1929, when we were able to simplify local government administration, and I hope that we shall continue upon those lines and give more power to county councils to deal with these great questions of policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will probably desire that I should say a few words at the close of this extremely interesting and valuable discussion. The Committee will remember that at the opening of the discussion I said that it seemed to me that this was a matter upon which one would very much welcome the full expression of a Committee which, in particular, contains so much special experience of administration of the sort. After having listened to the discussion with an open mind, it appears at the end of it that the argument put forward in the first place by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Thornbury (Captain Gunston), and supported by many other Members of the Committee on behalf of the county districts, upon the whole has it. It would certainly appear to me to be the result of the weight of opinion and of evidence, as expressed in our discussion, that we should not 'accept the Amendment for the transfer of powers to the county councils.

There are two reasons which I should like to mention which weigh with me from the particular point of view from which a Minister necessarily sees the matter. The first is, that we have of late piled a tremendous lot of work upon the county councils. I know that it is very commonly felt by members of county councils that they would be very glad to have a time of pure digestion without having any fresh initiative to take. The second point is, that there are many cases —some of them will at once occur to the mind of my hon. Friend—in which a county is really not any more than any other 'area the ideal area for planning. The county is quite an arbitrary area from the planning point of view, and the right way of getting to work is through

	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
the joint committee, which will be able to sort out the work in accordance with the real economic needs of the district. In view of these considerations, I shall vote against the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 7, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And for the purpose of preparing or adapting a scheme for an arterial road and other purposes connected with it, the county council of the county in which the road will be situate, and for the application of this Act to such purposes the county shall be deemed to be the district of the county council."</p></blockquote>
The object of the Amendment is to achieve that which, it appeared from his speech, the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Beaumont) desired to achieve by his Amendment. The difference is that his Amendment would not have achieved the object which he desired, and the Amendment standing in my name would very largely achieve the object which he and some other hon. Members have in view. The object of the Amendment is to give powers to county councils to use the machinery of town planning and to assist them in the construction of main arterial roads, or, for the matter of that, subsidiary arterial roads and matters of that kind. The sort of arterial roads which I have in mind are those such as the Edinburgh to Glasgow road, which I was instrumental in initiating a good many years ago, and which is now in course of construction, I believe..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When are you going to finish it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very large work, and when the scheme was conceived I considered that the extension of town planning powers as they existed under the Act of 1909 would assist. I found that the powers contained in the Town Planning Act, 1909, were insufficient to assist in the development of a scheme of that kind. Similarly, I found that town planning powers as they then existed would not 'help in the construction of the London-Kingston by-pass road. Particularly I have in mind the necessity for the construction of roads in the future from London to Southampton, which is destined, perhaps, to be the greatest port in the country. At the present time, no
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
power is given under existing Acts or under this Bill to enable the only people who can carry out schemes of that kind to use the powers of town planning to assist them in that purpose. The other purposes which I had in mind were such as the provision of large open spaces, something in the nature of diminutive national parks, the control of elevations along these main arteries and the provision of subsidiary roads to deal with development alongside them. The evidence of the need for such powers as I propose will be found, first, in the fact that it is only county councils that could possibly carry out such schemes, which would really be the backbone of all subsequent development, to which everything else would be subsidiary, and rightly and properly would fit in to these main features. Evidence is also to be found in the fact that the ordinary rural and urban councils and county or non-county boroughs have not the interest, and do not see the necessity. They certainly could not be expected to carry out piecemeal portions of such roads, and works of a more or less national character. Evidence is to be found, thirdly, in the experience we have had of the construction of arterial roads. On account of the absence of town-planning powers, they have been carried out very extravagantly, and there has not been sufficient foresight to enable the local authorities to acquire sufficient land on each side properly and effectively to control the elevations. On account of the absence of powers of that kind we have to suffer the unsatisfactory ribbon development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general idea underlying the Amendment is the present method whereby road maintenance is governed and controlled. County councils have the obligation to maintain county roads, while the subsidiary roads, being almost exclusively of local interest, are dealt with by the local authorities, and thus there is room for the county activities in dealing with the main roads, and local activities in dealing with the local roads. It is on that principle that the Amendment is conceived. I have conceived the idea of regarding the county as the district from the experience of Scottish local administration. In Scotland, the county is divided into districts governed by district committees for certain health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
and other purposes, and it is possible for county councils to vest in themselves as a whole the powers and duties of the district committees, and then they can operate as district committees. Similarly, I am proposing that a county should operate as a district for this purpose. It would be quite simple to achieve this object without very considerable dislocation of the text of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic principles on which I propose to proceed are to leave the county councils to prescribe the main, central and dominating features of the scheme, and to leave to the local authorities the filling in. Unless we do that, we shall never get any broad conception of regional planning. We shall get town planning which will be a continuation of a sort of peddling principle whereby we provide really for so many houses to the acre, and for an unfortunate and unnecessary interference with regard to elevations and that kind of thing. There is no power that I can see in the Bill to enable any broad, constructive scheme to be laid down. Under Clause 2 (2), county councils appear to have some power, but that is somewhat illusory in that a county council can become a town planning authority only if the county district authority agrees voluntarily to relinquish its powers. There is no initiatory power conferred on the county councils under that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must really keep to the Amendment, and not go back on general principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am explaining the reason for this. If the county councils had the power which my Amendment would confer upon them, there would be no need for the Amendment. I wish to show that they have no such power except such as the district council may choose voluntarily to relinquish to them. In Clause 3 it appears that a county council can confer and can join in the appointment of a joint committee. That is purely illusory, too. County councils can delegate only to a joint committee such powers of planning as they themselves possess. Looking through the Bill, I do not find any provision for a county council to take the initiative to provide for the main features of comprehensive regional town planning schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself unable to support the Amendment for two reasons. In the first place, it appears to me that Clause 4 gives the Minister the power to do what he wants. It enables him to prove that he can let two local authorities, whether county or district councils, come together and co-ordinate schemes of this kind if necessary. I cannot follow the hon. Member's reasoning, because at one moment we object to the extraordinary powers that are given under the Bill, and, in the next, we argue that further powers should be given to these authorities, to which I take the strongest exception. Thirdly, arterial roads are at present being made. I live near the Guildford by-pass road, which is under construction. I regret to say it is coming practically to my gate. I know we must have these by-pass roads, but they are made at present without any further extension of powers or alteration of the measure as it stands. There are many points that require very close consideration in the Bill, but I do not think this is one on which we need spend a great deal of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CRAVEN-ELLIS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment for this reason. I have in mind the main road between Liverpool and Manchester, which is carrying more commercial traffic than any other road in the country. It is under a large number of different authorities, and it was only with very considerable difficulty that eventually a combined scheme was agreed upon. In the meantime industry was considerably handicapped, and the transportation services were put to a great deal of expense. Therefore, I feel that some Amendment of this description is necessary. The hon. Member for Barrow (Sir J. Walker Smith) has referred to the road, say, from Southampton to London. Between 1 and 3 o'clock yesterday morning I came down that road, and there were 73 industrial vehicles on it. The road is narrow and dangerous. It runs through the districts of a number of authorities, and it would be an advantage for the county to have the power to plan an arterial road. Clause 4 refers to the adoption of a scheme. I take it that the Amendment is something outside the adoption of a scheme. It is confined to arterial roads. Therefore, we do not get the protection we want under Clause 4. We want to have the county

	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
council as the arterial road authority provided for in Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member think arterial roads are in the hands of the district councils at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel HENEAGE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not proved, I think, that the county councils would be the best authorities for arterial roads. Take one which is hanging fire at present —the Western Avenue. I understand that the local authorities are in agreement. What is the state of that road? It comes to a dead end. Is it the Bucks County Council that is sterilising any further progress, or is it the local authorities? If it is the county council, it is not advisable to hand over any further powers to county councils. I understand that in the Western Avenue the county council is the main stumbling block to further progress. Perhaps the hon. Member will say whether that is so. At present I cannot support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. MORRIS-JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very complicated Amendment, and I am not sure that I understand it. It is very difficult to make out what the hon. Member means in the last part of it. To a great extent arterial roads are controlled by the county councils already. There are no roads of any consequence, as far as I know, which sooner or later are not controlled by the county council or the county borough authority. I do not see the necessity for the Amendment. It seems to me rather carrying the whole Bill with the idea of taking all powers in the first instance from the immediate local authority. That seems to be a tendency of the Committee in all directions. I have in my county the largest rural district council in the Kingdom. I have an urban district council, which is also one of the largest in the country. They have very little control over roads. The Amendment, in any case, would not have the slightest effect on the Bill, and it is rather a waste of time to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTRY of HEALTH (Mr. Ernest Brown)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment overlooks one thing, and that is that we have to think not merely about town-planning powers in discussing the rela-
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
tions of local authorities to each other, but the general structure of the law under which these authorities act. The hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Sir J. Walker Smith) seems to overlook the fact that under the Local Government Act, 1929, county councils are the authority for arterial roads. He seems to have misconceived the whole idea of town planning. An arterial road itself is not conceived, or should not be conceived, as an isolated undertaking, but as part of a general scheme. County councils are, of course, consulted in the preparation of a scheme, and the scheme lays down which is to be the responsible authority for carrying out the work. Under the general law, county councils are the authority to construct arterial roads, and I hope the hon. Member will get rid of the idea that there are no sensible people on rural councils and urban councils. The hon. Member for Southampton (Mr. Craven-Ellis) referred to the Manchester and Liverpool road, but we did not gather whether it was a road planned under a town-planning scheme or not. The present practice is that county councils are consulted, and neither the Minister of Health nor the Minister of Transport would think of consenting to a scheme unless he was of the opinion of the county council upon it. I hope that the hon. Member will consent to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. WALKER SMITH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has entirely missed the point of the Amendment. I have no doubt that county councils do see schemes for arterial roads. I am not concerned with existing arterial roads, but with new arterial roads. The whole point of the Amendment, which the Parliamentary Secretary has missed, is that county councils should be a town planning authority under this Bill, and should have the powers which the Bill provides. At present they have no powers whatever under the Bill to enable them to do what the Parliamentary Secretary has said they are doing now. If they had these powers, they would be able to discharge their duties a great deal better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member thinks the Amendment does what he suggests, he had better read it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir HENRY JACKSON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 21, to leave out the words "and the transfer and superannuation of officers."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this Amendment will commend itself to the Minister and to the Committee. By Sub-section (2) of Clause 2, a district council may at any time by agreement with the county council relinquish its powers and duties under the Bill, and it is proposed that such agreement may apply, with such modifications as are agreed upon, to the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1929, relating to the transfer of property and liabilities and the transfer and superannuation of officers. When this Bill was before a Standing Committee on a former occasion the question of superannuation was also included. It was considered by the Committee to be rather unfair to officers that this question should be dealt with by agreement, and the Committee, as regards compensation, decided that the matter should be treated apart. Under Clause 2 the question of transfer and superannuation of officers still remains to be dealt with subject to the Local Government Act, 1929. I suggest to the Minister that in equity what was decided in the matter of compensation should apply to the question of transfer and superannuation. That is the object of the Amendment, and I hope that the Minister will be able to accept it, so that provision may be made for the transfer and superannuation of officers at a later stage of the Bill. I am advised that the proper procedure is to move that these words be left out now, so that between now and Report further consideration can be given to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The officials of the Department have gone into this matter from the point of view of the officers concerned, and I am able to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General CLIFTON BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 22, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) If it appears to the Minister to be expedient that the council of any county district should relinquish in favour of the council of the county within which the district is situate, or if the district extends into two or more counties in favour of the council of any of those counties any of their powers or duties under this Act, he may by order provide for such relinquishment upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
such terms and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that before making any such order the Minister shall. unless all the authorities affected thereby assent to the making thereof, cause a local inquiry to be held."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that in this matter there is a choice as between three evils —the county council, the local authority and the Minister. Evidently some hon. Members prefer the county council as against the district council. The Amendment does not give powers to the Minister which he does not already possess, and it is moved in the hope of building a bridge between these two sets of authorities so that they will be able to look at any plan from a larger point of view. At the present moment smaller councils cannot look at a plan from the larger point of view, although they know more about the requirements of the countryside. The Amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Minister to be expedient."</p></blockquote>
It is the minimum of interference on the part of the Minister, and he would exercise it only on those occasions when it was necessary to have a wider outlook on any proposed plan. It may be necessary to deal with boroughs with over 20,000 population, because we do not want to cripple them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel FREMANTLE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the hon. and gallant Member why he proposes this Amendment here, as it is almost word for word with Subsection (2) of Clause 35 of the Bill? Why does he want it in Clause 2 rather than in Clause 35? Why cannot we discuss this matter on Clause 35 when we consider the powers of the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General CLIFTON BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 35 does not refer to the same powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a substantial difference between this Amendment and Sub-section (2) of Clause 35, which starts—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the authority fail to prepare a scheme"</p></blockquote>
That is rather a defaulting Clause, whereas the Amendment starts—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Minister to be expedient that the council of any county district should relinquish in favour of the council "</p></blockquote>
That is not a defaulting Clause but a general power, which goes further than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
Sub-section (2) of Clause 35. I have considered whether the proposal of the Amendment is really included in the decision to which we came on an earlier Amendment. I do not look upon it as a special advantage that these powers should be conferred upon the Minister, and I hope the hon. and gallant Member will not press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of Health will understand that we do not agree to all the powers of the Minister in Clause 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 27, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that a county council shall not charge any expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, carrying out, or execution of any scheme made pursuant to such an agreement upon the district or on any local authority not a party to the agreement."</p></blockquote>
Sub-section (2) enables agreements to be arrived at between one county district and the county council, whereby the county district may relinquish its powers and its responsibilities to the county council. This Amendment, and the one following—in page 2, line 27, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) It shall be a condition of any such agreement that the expenses incurred by a county council shall be charged as expenses incurred for special county purposes in respect of the county district to which the agreement relates"</p></blockquote>
seek to enforce the payment of the proper expenditure entailed in connection with any district on the district itself. It is unreasonable that if three or four districts agree with the county council to hand over their powers they should be able to share their expenses throughout the county when in the same county three or four other districts carry out schemes for themselves. This matter is dealt with partially in Clause 30 and more fully in Clause 45, where we get our old friend, or our old enemy, in this Bill the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the Minister so directs"</p></blockquote>
the charge may be made a local one instead of a general one for the whole county. I hope the Minister will consider whether in equity he should not allow charges made specifically on behalf
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
of any district to be a specific charge on that district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given very careful consideration to this Amendment, and it does not appear to be necessary for the purposes which my hon. and gallant Friend has described, in view of the existing state of the law and of the general safeguards introduced into the Bill. As I understand it, his purpose, coupled with the subsequent Amendment, would be to throw the charge entirely upon the relinquishing authority. That is going too far. In a good many cases it might not be the right thing to do, in view of the fact that the plan might cover the wider area. We leave it, in the first place, to agreement on the occasion of the transfer between the relinquishing authority and the recipient authority. Freedom of agreement is a great safeguard for equity between the two parties; so that they can make sure that each is getting a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, there are the safeguards to which the hon. and gallant Member has referred, the safeguards in Clause 45, providing that the Minister may direct that any expenses incurred shall be defrayed in the case of a county council as expenses for general county purposes or, if he so directs, as expenses for special county purposes, chargeable on such part of the county as he may determine. It would be open to any district county council who considered that the county council were apportioning the expenses unfairly, to appeal to the Minister, and the Minister would have power in suitable cases to secure that the whole of the expenses were borne by the relinquishing authority as special county expenses. In these circumstances, the safeguard of the voluntary agreement and the further safeguard to which I have referred are adequate to secure the purpose which the hon. Member has in view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having regard to what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment, although I must emphasise the fact that I am not enamoured of these Ministerial safeguards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have put down this Amendment in order to draw attention to the power of co-option in the Bill.

Perhaps it would be to the advantage of the Committee to take a general discussion on the question of co-option.

It makes it very difficult when we have these admirable people who are so ready to interfere in other people's business being co-opted on to these committees, particularly if they have failed to secure election at the district council election. I think that there is an Amendment to debar such people from being elected to the committees if they have failed to secure election at the council election. My view is that if people are interested enough to take part in town and country planning schemes, they ought to take the trouble to get elected to the council through the proper channels. I do not mean that on occasion there are not valuable people who ought to be brought in, but, generally speaking, my view is that this provision in the Bill once more loads the dice against those whose business it is to run estates, to run property or to develop land. The people who are co-opted are generally those who have well-meaning views, but are very often divorced from practical policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of all the very large powers which have been handed over to local authorities recently, those in this Bill and in the Act of 1925, which it supersedes, involve as much expenditure of national and local funds as it is well nigh possible to conceive. The expense of town and country planning may be tremendous and may go on for a generation or more. How can we justify having a local authority empowered to deal with the ratepayers' money, if a joint committee is to be set up which, apparently, is going to be a paramount committee, not a committee in the ordinary sense and not a committee with reference back at all points to the county council? Once a joint committee has been set up it goes along until it has prepared its scheme, and there is no reference back until the whole job is finished, or practically finished. In these circumstances, how can one justify bringing on to that committee half as many people as there are in the total number of the committee? The proposal is to have one-half of co-opted members appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number of persons so co-opted shall not exceed one-half of the number of the appointed members of the committee."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one-third. As we all know, members of councils, especially members of county councils and city councils, are busy people. They have numerous other
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
duties to perform. I take it that the people who are to be co-opted will be those experts of whom the hon. and gallant Member for St. Albans (Lieut.-Colonel Fremantle) was so chiding at our last meeting. He said that if we went to one of those meetings we should not talk as much as we do now. I do not suppose we should, because I do not suppose we should have the chance. So far as my comparatively small experience of the experts goes, they seem to draw lots for the talking, and once they start they let the rest of the committee understand that they have possession of the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel FREMANTLE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain. Perhaps I was not very clear. I did not intend to mean experts in the sense of professional experts, but those who are on councils, such as the National Housing and Town Planning Council, or the Garden Cities' Association Council, of which I happen to have been chairman for 10 years. I would give the hon. and gallant Member and others every possible opportunity to hang themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And I would gladly avail myself of such an opportunity, if I thought that my fate was going to be shared by other members of that august assembly. Apart from the question of hanging, I appreciate what the hon. and gallant Member has said. I am not talking about experts who are engaged professionally. I am afraid of the type of person who considers himself an expert in dealing with other people's property and money, but not an expert from the standpoint of looking at a thing from the point of view that the people who are going to be affected look at it. It is that type of person who ought to be strictly limited on these committees. As I was saying, that type of person who comes on has far more time and leisure and more experience, and, therefore, has his arguments at his finger ends, and, it may well be, could overrule many of the committees upon which they had the power to appoint as many as one-third of the membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me come now to Sub-section (5), which deals with sub-committees. Supposing the sub-committees—which, again, is very improbable—are appointed in the same proportion as the main committee. Members of this Committee know that that very rarely happens, and they know,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
too, that in all these local authorities the real work is often done by the sub-committees. Take, for example, the recent changes of the Poor Law which have led to the public assistance committees. The county public assistance committee meets once a month, and its task is to go over the work already done by the sub-committees. It would be ridiculous for it to attempt to interfere to any great extent with the decisions taken by those subcommittees. Suppose that upon those sub-committees we have not more than one-third of co-opted members. It is very probable that if they had the power to co-opt, there would be upon many of those sub-committees an actual majority of non elected members. And yet it is those sub-committees who may be planning the expenditure of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of pounds of the ratepayers' or taxpayers' money. If we have to live under, as, I believe, we have, at any rate, for some months to come, a democratic and a representative Government, let it be both representative and democratic. Let the ratepayers have fair representation on the joint committee and on the sub-committees in this most important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. MORRIS-JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed by the hon. and gallant Gentleman. No doubt there are many advantages of co-option in public life. Sometimes you get a different point of view. You may bring in persons of rather a more independent turn of mind, and you may bring in persons of certain special knowledge. I am not referring to cranks and so-called experts in this particular line. We know that this sort of thing happens in public life in this country in regard to many responsible committees like the education committees. There are large county education committees in this country which have co-opted quite a proportion of members. There are great disadvantages of co-option. As was mentioned by the hon. and gallant Gentleman, a co-opted person has really hardly any responsibility. He is responsible to no one except himself. He gets all the advantages—if there are any advantages in public life—without any of the disadvantages. He might conceivably be a man with a grievance who would occasionally attend a particular committee when others who
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
were in constant attendance on other occasions might have great difficulty in attending, and thereby turn the weight of opinion. on a particular committee on a given date. In addition, co-opted members vote for expenditure which may go on for a series of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that there is no case in this Bill for a large measure of co-option. If co-option is to take place at all, it should be done upon the very minimum scale, and certainly upon a very much lower proportion than that which is at present provided for in Sub-section (4). I trust that the Minister will see the point of view of many hon. Members of this Committee, namely, that a joint committee is not a particular committee where co-option is a natural necessity, and that it would be no inconvenience for the public to deprive a large number of people of co-option who do not care to go through the ordeal and trouble of an election, but who are quite prepared to enjoy all the glamour, or whatever is associated with any of these committees. I hope that from that point of view the Minister will see that the disadvantages of co-option rather outweigh any advantages that there may be, especially on the scale he has put down in Sub-section (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the last two speakers, and I urge the Minister to look at the matter very carefully. He will see that later on I have an Amendment to Sub-section (5) to leave out the words "either wholly or partly." As my hon. and gallant Friend pointed out, the composition of the subcommittees requires to be very carefully watched. Under the Bill as it stands, a sub-committee may consist mostly of co-opted members. The whole of the subcommittee may be co-opted. If the main committee have power to co-opt a certain number of members, at least they should not be able to co-opt a greater number of members upon any sub-committee. That is the reason of my Amendment which I have had the opportunity of explaining. I wish to reinforce what my hon. and gallant Friend said; that the whole of this part of the Bill requires to be looked at very carefully. I observe that in some counties one might want, perhaps, to co-opt a member of the Central Landowners' Association or the Farmers' Union, or an expert or two, but every co-opted member means extra ex-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
pense of some sort or another upon the rates. No sub-committee which is formed should consist of any co-opted members, because there will already be a sufficient number of co-opted members in the joint committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel ACLAND -TROYTE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Denbigh (Dr. Morris-Jones) I feel that the advantages and disadvantages of co-option are very evenly balanced, but, unlike him, I rather come down upon the other side. I think that the advantages of a limited kind of co-option outweigh the disadvantages. We have co-option now in 'a very large number of cases throughout our local government, and on the whole it is an advantage. We know that co-opted members have not quite the same responsibility as ordinary, elected members and that on the whole they are inclined to be a little more extravagant. The most extravagant members upon education committees are nearly always co-opted members. But in a matter of this kind, there are many members of the community who would be able to take an active and a very useful part, but who for some reason or other could not see their way to submit themselves for election to the local authorities. I think that co-option should be allowed to a limited extent. The hon. and gallant Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Brown) has mentioned the Amendment which is upon the Paper in our joint names in regard to Subsection (5). I have another Amendment to Sub-section (5) in conjunction with my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Cumberland (Mr. F. Graham), and I do not really mind very much which of the two Amendments is carried, but, on the whole, I prefer the second Amendment. I think that the Minister is prepared to accept that Amendment because he has already accepted the principle of one-third of the co-option in Sub-section (4), and also in Clause 44 he again accepts the principle of one-third co-option. It might be possible to have one member of the joint committee, and all the rest co-opted from outside. I feel sure that the Minister will be prepared to accept the Amendment limiting the proportions to one-third.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord BURGHLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the Amendment for the following reason: Probably most of us here are agreed that one-third is too large a proportion to co-
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
opt. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Rhys) seems to fear very much that people who interfere so much—the interfering busy-bodies—would be the ones co-opted. I suggest that if the majority of a council feel that such people would interfere a lot, they would not co-opt them upon their council. On the other hand, I think that there are a large number, or a certain number, of people who are very busy in other spheres of life who have not the time to serve upon a county council and who upon a scheme like this might have some very valuable 'and special local knowledge. If you did not enable those persons to get upon these particular councils, it would very much weaken the case which might be put forward. A certain number of people who have special knowledge, and are able to serve and strengthen a council, should have their names brought forward. As far as the ratepayers go, they are safeguarded in that they are in a majority. I think it would be a very good thing if we reduced the numbers to be co-opted. If we get too many, we fear that there are likely to be some extravagant persons. If we could keep down the numbers, that argument would entirely disappear, and you would be left with the advantages which would accrue from having their very special knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with very great interest to the discussion in which the two points of view have been put so very clearly. Let me, first of all, clear up one misconception on the part, I think, of the hon. and gallant Member for South Leicester (Captain Waterhouse) as regards the period for which the joint committee will serve. The period for which the joint committee will serve will be precisely as long as the authorities which appoint it choose to give it. They can give it as long or as short a period as they like, and the period of appointment of each member of the joint committee can give him just as long or as short a life on the joint committee as he pleases. So they are not, as it were, in the saddle to ride "neck or nothing" until the whole thing is over. It depends upon their mandate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May they alter the mandate when once they have received it? They may set up a committee for two years, and at the end of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
one year, if they dislike members, can they say: "You only sit for one year and six months"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are not introducing into this Bill for the first time in our Constitution the principle of the re-call. As regards the advantages or disadvantages of co-option, I think that experience has shown that in this region of administration there are very great advantages in giving a reasonable measure of co-option for the reasons, in particular, which have been referred to so well by the Noble Lord. The kind of people you want to be on, and the kind of people who get put on—who are they? I do not think that it is quite fair to the common sense of our local authorities or to ourselves to suggest that they are the cranks; not at all. That is not what happens, and it is not what one wants to secure. One wants to secure that very often rather over-occupied members of the local authority shall be able to get hold of such a person as, for instance, a big business man in a locality who knows the economic needs of the locality, who knows what a factory wants for its layout and so on when they are planning, who may not be able to take on the whole job of local government, but may be able to serve his locality in this particular way. Again, there are big employers of labour and representatives of the landowning interest. I do not suppose that anyone could be more useful to good town planning than a good surveyor. There may very well be localities where you can have a splendid man to help you with your town planning. He may be tremendously keen to use his professional knowledge, but he may not be able to take on the general work of local government, and it would be a great pity not to have him in. An architect is another case in point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I emphasise another point, to reassure those who are afraid of this power? It is not compulsory. There is no obligation on the local authorities to co-opt members. It is optional, and, as a matter of fact, the tendency is in the other direction, of reluctance to put people on. Local authorities do not, within our experience, need any restraining hand to prevent them from exercising these powers too widely. They do not take the advantage of good chances, when they have them,
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
for co-option. But, as a result of listening very carefully to criticisms that have been made against the structure of the Bill, I see a point in which it is not only possible but right to meet the criticisms that have been advanced. I entirely agree that there should be no possibility of a majority of co-opted members on any responsible body which is actually doing work and spending money, and I am prepared to make quite sure that that shall not be so. It could not be so under Clause 4, because there you cannot have more than a third even if a most extravagant use is made of co-optive powers. It might be, under Clause 5, that you could get a majority of co-opted members and, in order to meet the very reasonable objection which has ben taken to it, I suggest some such wording as this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So, however, that the number of members of the sub-committee who are not appointed members of the joint committee shall not exceed one-half of the number of members of the sub-committee who are appointed members of the joint committee."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be the best way, on the spur of the moment, for securing the object and, if it does not do it, we will get a form of words that does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lieut. -Colonel ACLAND-TROYTE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly my Amendment in other words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, perhaps the hon. and gallant Gentleman will accept the draft which I have received from the draftsman, because it will probably fit in better with the general structure of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. MORRIS-JONES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the right hon. Gentleman consider reducing the number of members of the committee to a number not exceeding a third? That would be quite a substantial number in a large committee. Under his suggested Amendment a substantial attendance of co-opted members might overrule the others on some particular provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. CAUTLEY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry the Minister has not seen his way to strike out the power of co-option altogether. I object very strongly to co-option on all representative bodies and I regret the tendency that there is to resort to it except in cases where personal administration is essential to the success of a particular work in hand. On the guardians and in education and welfare
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
matters, where a very intimate acquaintance with the individual is concerned, I think a great service is rendered by co-opted members. But, when we come to the ordinary administration of municipal matters, it is extremely desirable, in order to obtain the full value of representative institutions, that the persons who are going to administer those matters should stand for election and get the mandate of their constituents. It is particularly so under this Bill. Under Clause 1, we are giving power to deal with developed areas, including practically the whole of the business premises of the country, because they are collected in towns. We are now giving power, in the case of joint committees, to co-opt outside people to deal with vast commercial and pecuniary interests, people who have never appealed to the electors and who are absolutely irresponsible for any decisions that they may give. I hope the hon. Member will go to a Division and test the Committee's view on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to think that we have got into a little bit of a difficulty through taking all these questions affecting co-option together. There are several entirely different points. The Amendment raises the question whether co-option shall take place at all. Then comes an Amendment dealing with the question under what circumstances it may take place, then to what extent it may take place, and then the composition of sub-committees. One might easily hold a different opinion on every one of these points. There is a series of laws affecting councillors, who are definitely precluded from entering into financial arrangements with the council of which they are members. A man may not, in theory, use his position on a borough council to secure contracts for himself. I am not clear whether those regulations, which render them liable to severe penalties, apply also to co-opted members. That is a point of considerable importance. There has been a certain amount of anxiety lately, owing to the enormous increase in the powers of local authorities, as to what goes on in some of them. I have seen notepaper suggesting, if not saying in so many words, that such and such a firm is par-
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
ticularly well able to get plans passed by a local authority because of its connection with that local authority. It is undesirable to extend anything of that sort. I shall be prepared to vote with my hon. Friend if he goes to a Division, but, in any case, we should make sure that it should not be possible to make hasty decisions by a mere casual outside majority. If we decide to co-opt members, the number should be less than that provided in the Bill at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McENTEE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would cut out the co-opted members altogether, but, if the right hon. Gentleman is inclined to allow them on joint committees, I would urge him to reduce the number. I know of cases when co-opted members have actually been in the majority although only a third were members of the committee. I can see a joint committee of that character spending large sums of public money which would not be done if there were a fuller attendance of elected members. I am not sure whether there is any ruling body which could undo a thing like that, but in any case it appears to me to be a danger which we should not allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another danger that strikes me. When you get a joint committee of different authorities coming together for a common purpose, each would have its own district particularly in mind, and the welfare of its own district would always be uppermost. It might be, at the first meeting at which co-opted members were appointed, if there were three authorities, two of them might be one or two short of their full representation and the other might take advantage of it to give its own particular district a permanent majority and get considerable advantages for it. That is a danger that we ought to avoid. Generally speaking, I think the experience of the Ministry of Health and the complaints they have had of similarly constituted committees should induce them to hesitate before they allow so high a number as a third of the actual constitution of the committee. If the right hon. Gentleman is not prepared to strike out the principle of co-option, he should, at any rate, agree to a considerable reduction in the proportion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir GEORGE HUME</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point that has not yet been made. It is very difficult sometimes to man a

particular committee fully, and it would be a very definite disadvantage if a council was prevented from co-opting members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the Noble Lord's question, the law, as I am informed, without very careful investigation and in the absence of a Law Officer is that in general the co-opted members of committees are not subject to these general disqualifications as regards contracts made with authorities on which they are serving. It is an imperfection in the law which ought to be put right, but it is an existing imperfection. The hon. Member for Denbigh (Dr. Morris-Jones) raises the question of the proportion under Sub-section (4). I have accepted the suggestion to secure a majority of elected members on sub-committees under Sub-section (5). It has been called to my attention that in the proceedings in Committee the Minister then in charge of the Bill did undertake to make a reduction in the number of co-opted members. Undoubtedly when I introduced the Bill I said that I had incorporated all the arrangements made in Committee on previous occasions, but 1 find that in this regard I have not, and it is necessary for the fulfilment of my obligation that I should make some reduction. I will meet the Amendments which have been proposed by moving a
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
reduction of the co-opted members below the proportion of one-half of the number of the appointed members. I suggest that we should substitute for one-half of the appointed members on the Committee one-quarter of the total members, which will be a slightly less reduction than that proposed by the hon. and gallant Member, but still a substantial reduction. I hope that will meet his views. There is very little in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
