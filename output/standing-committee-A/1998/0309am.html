	<time>Tuesday 9 March 1999</time>

	<p>[MR. EDWARD O'HARA 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Greater London Authority Bill
<br><br><!-- lb --> (Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Committee back to its deliberations, albeit briefly in my presence—Mr. Winterton is otherwise engaged, but he will relieve me as soon as he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we begin, it may be helpful if I advise the Committee about two of the debates that are due to take place. I should like to draw its attention to Government amendments Nos. 989 and 1005, which are to clauses 200 and 201 respectively. Government amendment No. 989 is grouped with Government new schedule 8 and several proposed amendments thereto. Government amendment No. 1005 is grouped with Government new schedule 9 and proposed amendments thereto. It will be in order for hon. Members to refer to the respective amendments, new schedules and the schedules that they are intended to replace. Formal decisions on the new schedules and the proposed amendments to them will be taken at the end of the Committee's deliberations on part IV, later today, as the selection list indicates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, if Government amendment No. 989 is agreed to, the amendments to schedule 13 will not be debated. If Government amendment No. 1005 to clause 201 is agreed to, amendments to schedule 14 will not be debated. The questions that schedules 13 and 14 be schedules to the Bill will be put without debate, as the Committee will be able, if it accepts my advice, to discuss them with the respective new schedules. I hope that the Committee is clear about that, and understands that it will be able to discuss all of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I call Mr. Ottaway on a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is more a question than a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Will it still be possible to press the proposed amendments to new schedule 8 to separate votes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, at the appropriate time. Mr. Winterton will probably be in Chair when that occurs, but the answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you, Mr. O'Hara, confirm that for debate on clause 201, Government amendment No. 1007 is grouped with Government amendment No. 1005 and will therefore not he considered separately? The grouping is unclear because of faulty indentation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The plus sign shows that those amendments are grouped together, but amendment No. 1007 should perhaps be indented. The group to which the hon. Gentleman referred comprises Government

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 987, in page 104, leave out lines 3 and 4 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Each of the following bodies, namely.—",</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 234, in page 104, line 3, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Mayor".</p>
	<p>No. 418, in page 104, line 3, leave out "may" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall, at the request of the Mayor,".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Government amendment No. 988.</p>
	<p>No. 420, in clause 201, page 104, line 12, leave out "may" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall, at the request of the Mayor,".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now reach the last chapter of the Bill covering transport, which relates to road user charging. The Government are committed to giving London's mayor and the boroughs new powers to tackle serious transport problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 987 and 988 will give the authority, the boroughs and the common council of the City of London road user charging powers, instead of the provision in the Bill as drafted, which allows the Secretary of State to make regulations by order. That will enable charging schemes to he brought forward quickly to help to deliver the policies and objectives contained in the mayor's transport strategy. That is in line with our proposals for a strong and effective mayor with real powers to tackle congestion and pollution in London. It will be for the mayor and the boroughs to decide whether to make use of the powers, and, if so, how to design the scheme to put them into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendments Nos. 418 and 420, tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), is clearly to ensure that new charging powers introduced by the Secretary of State should take full account of the mayor's proposals. Our solution is more elegant than that proposed by the right hon. Gentleman, and I hope that he will agree not to press his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1007</span>
I put exactly the same point to the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), and ask whether he seriously suggests, as his amendment implies, that the mayor should have power to make secondary legislation. I cannot imagine that that was in the hon. Gentleman's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore commend Government amendments Nos. 987 and 988 to the Committee, and invite the right hon. member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the Government amendment. When we tabled amendment No. 234, we knew exactly what we were doing, because its provision was preferable to the Secretary of State running London. In our judgment, the mayor should run London. I am pleased that, having seen the weight of the amendments tabled by the Opposition, the Government were finally persuaded to come round to our point of view on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shakes his head, but he tabled a perfectly clear clause and a detailed schedule which provided that the Secretary of State was to be the central figure. He knows that that was wrong, and he knows that our amendments were right. I am pleased that the Secretary of State is now out of the picture, and that the matter is now for the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall shortly discuss whether the assembly should be involved in the matter, but we welcome the Government's conversion to the Opposition's point of view. You will be aware, Mr. O'Hara, that we have pulled several amendments from this group. We left amendment No. 234 in place simply to make the point. I do not need to seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 234, as it does not lead the group, but if it did, I would withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support in principle the proposal to introduce road user charging in London. That is a welcome step. Our constituents in London, who have to battle through congested, polluted streets, or through an underinvested public transport system, know the importance of such a move. We will be considering the detail in today's debate. We have problems with many of the details of the Government's proposals and the permissive framework that they are setting up. We hope that we can persuade them to change their mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, the Government amendments seem to be moving in the right direction. I emphasise the word "seem" because I am not yet totally convinced. A smokescreen has been put up around the two clauses that we will spend of most today debating. Amendments have been tabled late, which has ensured that the Committee is debating the clauses on a very important day during which the press are focused on the issues being debated in the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
The way in which many of the clauses and new schedules are drafted is designed to add to that smokescreen. We give a half cheer to the fact that the mayor, in the form of the authority in this case, will be in charge of developing road user charging schemes. However, it appears from some of the other Government amendments and new schedules that the Secretary of State will retain many of his powers, and has not been deprived of control over charging systems. I shall refer to the consultation paper that the Government published in December 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman goes any further, the opportunity to discuss the content of the new schedules will be available when we reach the relevant groups of amendments.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I seek to make, Mr. O'Hara, is that the Secretary of State is being taken out of this part of the Bill only to reappear elsewhere. The Committee may, in passing the Government amendment, be under the impression that power is at last being given to the authority. In reality, it is clear from the other new schedules and Government amendments before us today that the Secretary of State will reappear, and I do not want the Committee to be under any illusion about that. I suggest that the Government should be rather more honest and stop putting up this smokescreen. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are several different conversations going on at once, which makes it difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman who is speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their consultation paper "Breaking the Logjam", the Government suggested that their approach would not give the Secretary of State too many powers. Paragraph 3.27 states
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given the unique status of London's directly elected Mayor and strategic authority, the Government proposes that the role of the Secretary of State should be kept to a minimum for road user charging schemes brought forward by the Mayor or the boroughs "—</p></blockquote>
three cheers for that. However, the document goes on
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State's consent to schemes introduced in the London area will therefore be needed only to ensure that the actions of the Mayor were not inconsistent with the delivery of national policy objectives and do not have unacceptable impacts beyond London's boundary"—</p></blockquote>
that is fair enough—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and on the proposed use of the proceeds."</p></blockquote>
That appears to keep the Secretary of State very much at the heart of the proposals. Despite Government amendment No. 987, Liberal Democrat Members are not yet convinced that the Secretary of State is going to leave the scene. In new schedule 8, for example, the Secretary of State appears time and again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman of what I said about new schedules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. O'Hara, but it is important that Committee members realise that the Secretary of State is going to retain huge powers. He is mentioned in paragraph 9(7) of new schedule 8 and in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
paragraphs 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 28. I am particularly concerned about the reference in paragraph 17(6). It does not actually refer to the Secretary of State—the word "regulations" is used, but that is clearly intended to refer to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have advised hon. Members on several occasions that the debate on the new schedules has not yet arrived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I seek your ruling. This group of amendments is about replacing the Secretary of State's power with the mayor's power. As far as I can see, it is the only group of amendments relating to that subject. It must, therefore, be in order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are references in clause 200 and in the forthcoming new schedules. For the moment, I want the debate to be confined to the references in clause 200. There will be further opportunity to develop the subject in detail when we discuss the rather more substantial new schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will abide by your ruling, Mr. O'Hara. I will conclude my remarks by saying that if the Government are taking the Secretary of State out of the clause—as they appear to be doing with Government amendment No. 987—we will support them. That is what we argued for on Second Reading, and it is an excellent step forward. We will, however, come back to the issue. We have read all the other new schedules that the Government have tabled and we are not convinced that they follow Government amendment No. 987 through to the letter. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we continue. I should say that I am having to rise more frequently than I would normally prefer to. That is largely because far too much background chatter is going on. I call on members of the Committee to co-operate in being silent while an hon. Member has the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister invited me not to press amendment No. 418, but I do not need to do so. He made no reference to amendment No. 420. You will be the first to tell me, Mr. O'Hara, that I am under no obligation to press the amendments. The Minister was, however, kind enough to refer to one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the pride of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South at the fact that the Opposition have succeeded in pressing the Government to change the Bill in the way that they have. It is noticeable that Government amendment No. 987 comes 753 amendments after my hon. Friend's amendment and 569 after my own. If the Government's amendment is more elegant than mine or my hon. Friend's, that is because they have had ample time to prepare it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), I will clarify how the clause will read when the amendments that we propose are agreed, it will read:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each of the following bodies, namely—
	<ol>
	<li>the Authority,</li>
	<li>any London borough council, or</li>
	<li>the Common Council,
<br><br><!-- lb --> way establish and operate schemes for imposing charges in respect of the keeping or use of motor vehicles on roads in their area."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
It could not be much simpler. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman found it so difficult to understand a simple process, which will make it clear that the mayor—in the case of the Greater London authority—and individual London borough councils will have such a power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the hon. Gentleman has probably been a little distracted. I see from the paper that the incompetence of his local authority and its agents in administering housing benefit has resulted in a massive number of tenants in his area not getting their benefits—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure what housing benefit in Kingston has to do with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has been somewhat distracted over the weekend because he has had to sort out his incompetent authority's messes. That is why he has been unable to resolve the issues that are raised in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pretty rich for the Opposition to criticise us. Last week, we were criticised for the new clauses and amendments that we moved. We made it clear that we moved them to clarify that the mayor would have powers to introduce congestion charging schemes. That is the right way forward. We always said that that was our intention, and we have done what we said we would do. The Opposition may like to make a fuss about that, but, of course, they made a fuss about different things last week and will no doubt make a fuss about different things next week. The truth of the matter is that the Government are on course to deliver what they and only they can: the framework for a congestion charging scheme that will be operated by the mayor and the boroughs in London and the proceeds of which will be hypothecated for transport usage. That is a major breakthrough in transport policy, which is purely to the credit of the Government. Opposition parties should take no credit for it at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Government have taken the wise advice of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. They have simplified the Bill's drafting and, above all, given the mayoralty the power, through the authority, to levy congestion charges and parking charges if it so wishes. However, I must express my strong reservation: these are very sweeping and wide-ranging powers. That they could be introduced in advance of any significant amelioration of public transport in London will, I think, cause indignation among Londoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am apprehensive about the effect on residents in the outer London boroughs in particular because I imagine—perhaps the Minister will guide me on this matter—that the charges will be levied by the authority for entry into central London rather than into Greater London as a whole, although the authority will of course have discretion. But if, as has been indicated in the press,

it is more likely that the charges will be imposed for entry into inner London, they could augment, rather than diminish, congestion in those outer London boroughs where people coming into the capital tend to park their cars and from where they take public transport into the centre of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges ignore the fact that many Londoners work extremely unsocial hours. People working on the foreign exchanges in the City, for example, need to come in before public transport is operating. They will be penalised for their energy, initiative and hard work. A great many Londoners also have to make cross-London journeys. An example is those who live in my borough of Hillingdon and work at Heathrow. Because there is no really effective public transport other than some buses—there is certainly no tube line from Hillingdon direct to Heathrow—they could cross a number of borough boundaries and could, hypothetically, face a number of different charging regimes and quite a severe levy of additional impost. That is over and above the additional fuel tax that I suspect they will have to pay following this afternoon's Budget statement. Then, when they get to work, they will be penalised yet again for parking at their place of work, or at least their employers will be. That is hardly a reward for providing employment for Londoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foretell pain, anguish and grief resulting from the charges. They will be bitterly contested. Although, as I said at the outset, it is to the Government's credit that they have taken the Opposition's advice by removing the power from the Secretary of State—which would have been even more resented—and giving it to the mayoralty, I am nevertheless fearful of how the schemes will operate in practice. With that reservation, I am glad that my colleagues have done their duty and urged the Government to see sense. As for the bigger issue, however, I am profoundly anxious about the effect that the charges will have on travelling into London. Londoners are my prime concern, as a London Member of Parliament, especially those in Harefield in my constituency, where there is virtually no public transport other than buses—no railway or tube line serves Harefield—but I am also anxious about the effect on people outside London coming in, who I am sure will feel embittered at the charges.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments were tabled when the Secretary of State was still running the show. To a degree, they have now been downgraded to probing amendments rather than retaining their original, more aggressive stance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson): such charges will have a profound effect on people in London. I believe that they are a major mistake on the part of what have hitherto been a fairly surefooted Government; although they will have a profound effect on people's attitudes, they will not have much effect on congestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NICHOLAS WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. We are all aware that traffic in central London is not increasing by any significant degree. Growth is primarily in outer London, but we also know that central London will be the irresistible target. It will be easier to introduce road user charging there than out in the suburbs—but more of that when we come to the big bang debate on new schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why we still wanted to table the amendments, despite the Government changing clause 200, is that they would provide for an assessment and research to be conducted on the impact of road user charging on central London. I received a Parliamentary brief from the Automobile Association, as I am sure other Committee members did. Although it is a motorists' organisation, I believe that it has been very fair in its assessment of motoring matters in the capital. Its brief highlights its concern that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are no requirements for an appraisal to be undertaken to show that there will be measurable and significant differences in quality and quantum arising from the introduction of a charging scheme".</p></blockquote>
We have downgraded the amendments to probing amendments because we anticipate that the Minister for Transport in London will say that this is a matter for the mayor. If so, I shall be interested to hear how she envisages the mayor going about that. The impact of charges—particularly their economic impact, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood noted—on surrounding areas and on boroughs is a highly relevant
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
matter which we will debate in greater depth when we reach new schedule 8. However, I hope that the Minister will agree that there is a case for assessing how the charges will work.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly support my hon. Friend. Amendment No. 737, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No regulations may be made…unless research has been conducted into the likely impact of such regulations",</p></blockquote>
is the sine qua non—the prerequisite—of any sensible charging scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in the debate on the previous group of amendments, I have my doubts about charging per se, but at the very least Londoners have the right to expect a really serious study to be carried out before the authority—or, for that matter, a London borough or the common council of the City of London—initiate an ill-considered, ill-thought-through road charging or parking charging regime which will not have the support of Londoners from the outset. That is the crucial point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, right from the start, the scheme is a source of antagonism between the authority and London residents, that will be a thoroughly bad initiation of the authority. It may suit the Government, in that they will have shuffled off responsibility on to the authority, but Londoners will recognise that the scheme was promulgated by the Government and carried out at their behest. It is because they have not had the wherewithal to fund the necessary improvements in public transport in London that we face charges on motoring in the capital. Nevertheless, relations between the authority and Londoners could be poisoned unless, before a workplace parking charge scheme is initiated, a careful study of the detailed implications is carried out and is circulated to councils, interested bodies and to the whole of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not be good news for the Government as the subsidy for London Underground will run out in the financial year 2000–01. We have highlighted the black hole, which is clear for all to see, in the finances of London Underground, especially as private sector investors have not been found to take on leases for the infrastructure of the underground system. The need for charging is great and the pressure from the Secretary of State on the authority will be great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Government reject the amendments, as I am sure they will, I hope that the authority will have the good sense to follow the spirit of the amendments and initiate wide-ranging public consultation with motorists and employers before imposing motoring and workplace parking charges upon Londoners. I applaud these probing amendments; they are of the greatest importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to your appearance in Committee this morning, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South said that the Government had changed their mind and adopted Conservative policies in respect of the previous group of amendments. However, the hon. Gentleman's views reflect something of a U-turn for the official Opposition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1015</span>
and certainly for himself because he has consistently campaigned against the idea of road user charging. As my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction said, the Government amendment that we have just discussed will provide powers to enable the mayor and boroughs to introduce road user and workplace parking charges and will therefore remove the need for the Secretary of State to make regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene, but the Minister has moved on and I would hate her to leave in the air the possibility—the remote scintilla of a thought—that we support the Government's proposals. However, if the wretched proposals are to be introduced, I would rather that the mayor controlled them than the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be a scintilla of a U-turn in the official Opposition's position. They have moved from an absolute and obdurate rejection of the scheme in any form to saying that charges are all right as long the mayor and the boroughs run them. That is precisely what has been included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the hon. Gentleman's concern about the amount of research that he suggests must be undertaken before the mayor could implement any such scheme. Extensive research has already been undertaken, not only by this Government but by the previous Administration and by bodies such as London First. The Government are currently undertaking an extensive study to provide information for all the mayoral candidates on the use of road user and workplace parking charging powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's review of charging options for London is considering how those charges might work in practice. Representatives on the study's steering group include London Transport, the boroughs, the Traffic Director for London, the London Planning Advisory Committee, the transport departments of three London universities, the Automobile Association, the Royal Automobile Club and Transport 2000. The final report is expected in September and will be available to all mayoral candidates. It will add to the large body of research that already exists, including that conducted by London First, the Leicester road tolling study and the London congestion charging research that was introduced by the previous Administration. We will not expect the mayor or the boroughs to enter blindly into—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When will the study be published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks from a sedentary position when we shall publish the Leicester study. We shall do that at the earliest opportunity after its completion and the examination of its results. The study considers the first experiment in this country to use electronic charging and therefore it—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I repeat to the hon. Gentleman what I have just said: it is the first such study to consider the use of that equipment for that form of charging. It would be improper not to ensure that the study is completed accurately and fully. We must examine the research before it is published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to note that Londoners will be guinea pigs in the matter—the Minister admitted that much. Londoners already suffer higher costs as a result of living in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may understand this simple question: will mothers who drive their children to school across borough boundaries be liable to the suggested charges on motorists? There is nothing in the powers to prevent that. Is that the family-friendly policy that the Labour party espouses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly unaware that, since we came to office, the thrust of the Government's policy has been to reduce the burden imposed on mothers and other family members by their ferrying children to and from school. That is why the Government instituted the school traffic advisory group that is made up of representatives from my Department, the Department for Education and Employment, and the Department of Health—a broad group of people—to ensure that mothers are not burdened in that way. Indeed, 30 per cent, of households without access to a private car may also be affected by the congestion on our roads during the rush hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know when it is half term because of the disappearance of so many cars from our roads. It has been proven that it is in the best interest of children for them to walk or to cycle to school in safety. It is better for their health and for their social interaction, and it would be better for all of us if the pollution pumped out of petrol-driven engines was reduced. That would improve the quality of air breathed by us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details of any scheme that the mayor introduces will be for the mayor and the boroughs to decide. The Government have taken a radical step forward with the hypothecation of all revenues raised from road user charging. Londoners regard themselves not as guinea pigs, but as being especially favoured. The first schemes will be introduced into a city that, as everyone who lives or works there knows, suffers from congestion on its streets and the concomitant pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed subsection (1A) in amendment No. 762 and amendment No. 739, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, would permit charging schemes to be introduced only if they encouraged the use of public transport in preference to other forms of transport. That is surprising because I remember that, in a previous debate, the hon. Gentleman asked whether such revenues might be used for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists. My hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction reassured him on that point. However, from the amendments, it seems that the hon. Gentleman wishes to preclude the improvement of the environment for pedestrians and cyclists. That is another example of the official Opposition not knowing what they do or do not want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the Government's strategy is to see seamless journeys from front door to destination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is having a go at me, I draw the Committee's attention to the letters that she must write to all members of the Committee to correct what she said on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1017</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never attempted to avoid my responsibilities. I would be happy to inform Committee Members if I inadvertently misled them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point was about any scheme that the mayor might choose to introduce, based on the revenues raised from road user charging. The Government's intention is to promote seamless journeys, such as those from front door to bus stop that inevitably involve walking along pavements, or from home to a railway station by bicycle. Those forms of transport will have to form part of the mayor's strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will agree to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but it is perfectly clear from the speech that the Minister has just delivered that we are to have occasional references to the fact that there may be a degree of inconsistency in the Opposition's position. To avoid having to make the remarks that I am about to make every time that the Minister makes that point, I shall do so once, and thereafter I shall refer to it by a code name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the outstanding exercises in legislative leadership in the English-speaking world occurred in the 18th century, when there was an eclipse of the sun while the Connecticut legislature—a colonial legislature—was in session. There was no forewarning of that eclipse, so there was widespread concern that it was the end of the world. The Speaker—in your place, Mr. Winterton—said, in a summary and outstanding manner, "Gentlemen, either it is the end of the world, or it is not. In either condition, we shall be found doing our duty. I command that candles be brought."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and other Opposition Committee members are faced with legislation to which we have a marked aversion, it is still reasonable for us to continue to do our duty. In future, whenever it becomes relevant, I shall allude to that episode as the Connecticut eclipse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am eternally grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster for encapsulating in a few words what I would have taken several minutes to say. It is the Opposition's role to probe. At times we probe alternatives; that is the reason for the various amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was comforted by the passage of the Minister's speech that pointed out the level of research that is being conducted. She referred to the Leicester experiment, which I raised under a point of order on Thursday. The White Paper stated clearly that the results of that experiment would be published in autumn 1998. They have not yet been published; that would have been a useful document for us to have had before us today. The Minister was right when she said that we must closely consider the result of such experiments before proceeding with a pilot scheme. It is pretty rash to use London as the ultimate pilot scheme; frankly, it may be disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1018</span>
Nevertheless, I am pleased to hear from the Minister that research has been carried out. We look forward to considering its results in the autumn—I hope that they will not be confined to mayoral candidates. Those mortals who consider that their role lies in this House, rather than over the river, will still be interested in that research. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 992, in page 104, line 3, after "(1)", insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 993, in clause 201, page 104, line 12, after "(1)", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the revenue raised is to be invested solely and exclusively in better provision for public transport, cycling and walking in Greater London.".</p></blockquote>
I call Mr. Davey, hoping that he is not subject to a Connecticut eclipse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope not, Mr. Winterton. However, like the Speaker of the Connecticut legislature, I intend to be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 992 and 993 were primarily tabled as probing amendments, but the Government may decide to accept them, because they move the Bill in a direction in which they have sought to move it. We are trying to ensure that the new congestion charges raise revenue that is ploughed back into the public transport system—defined, as the Minister for Transport in London said, not just as public transport but also cycling and walking. Indeed, we are trying to ensure not only that that happens, but that it is seen that it will happen prior to the mayoral elections. I am sure that the Government will acknowledge that it is important that we obtain public support for the proposals. We want the clause to incorporate that pledge so that people are left in no doubt. The Minister may well say that that matter is covered elsewhere—indeed it is—but we think that it is important to include it here as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments raise a second probing question. Ministers may argue that amendments Nos. 992 and 993 are slightly narrower than the Government would wish. Elsewhere, relevant transport purposes are defined as the mayor's strategy as it relates to transport directly and indirectly. That could cover a range of issues, including planning, research and subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for London and Construction might say that our amendment would tie the hands of the mayor and be too prescriptive. If he believes that, we will certainly listen to him. Does he, however, agree with me that it is important that the purposes of road user charging are made very clear to the people of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1019</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments objectively. They would require the revenues derived from road user charging and parking charges to be ploughed back in perpetuity for the betterment of transport in London. That is better than the Government's proposal of a 10-year hypothecation of the revenue for public transport. After that, goodness knows what will happen, particularly if it is an election year and the electorate has to be softened up, or the Treasury needs some money for its own purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that the Liberal Democrats do not comprehend the necessity for the use of the car by people living in outer London in particular. I refer again to the village of Harefield in my constituency. It is the last truly rural village in Middlesex. It has no tube and no train. No one is suggesting that, as a consequence of the charges, sufficient revenue will be derived for a major capital spending programme to extend the rail and tube network to far-flung places such as Harefield. The best that the people of Harefield could hope for would be a slight improvement in bus services; but, quite candidly, people living in communities like that need to be able to use their cars without having the additional burdens of charges imposed on them. The Liberal Democrats are unprepared to recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no comfort to people in Harefield that the walking facilities will be improved if they have to give up their cars because they cannot afford to run them any more. As ever with Liberal Democrat amendments, these include, I suppose, an iota of sense, but looking at them in any depth shows that they are gravely defective for people in outer London who need to use their cars for economic reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the motivation behind the Liberal Democrat amendments. Indeed, the thought occurred to me earlier than it occurred to them. I think it was during a debate on the River Thames, when you were gracious enough, Mr. Winterton, to allow me temporarily to include the towpath, and the bicycles and pedestrians on the towpath, as falling within the purview of the clause in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, not falling in the river.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) says, not falling in the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that under your very gracious dispensation, Mr. Winterton, the Minister was good enough to confirm that assistance with cycling and pedestrian arrangements would fall within the appropriate use of money raised from the levies and charges. Therefore, we have, on the record, a commitment by the Government that that will be an appropriate use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I salute the Liberal Democrats for having tabled amendments to include such a provision in the Bill. I do not object to that, but simply want to make the point that the thought has occurred elsewhere in London, not just in Kingston and Surbiton. I am not quite sure how either cycling or pedestrian arrangements fall within the doctrine of public transport. The Minister may wish to clarify that semantic activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say just a word or two, and pick up the points made by the hon. member for Ruislip-Northwood and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke in support of the amendments for the definitional reason recently advanced by the right hon. Gentleman. For self-evident reasons, people would not think that cycling or walking are included in the ordinary definition of public transport. We want to ensure that London is not caught by a more limited definition, as better forms of transport than motorised vehicles need support and encouragement.

In response to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, I should point out that in supporting the principle of road charging, the Liberal Democrats have never suggested in Committee or elsewhere that such charging should prevent people from using their cars when they need to do so. The idea of charging is that the GLA should have power to devise a scheme. Such a scheme could exclude the village of Harefield, which I know, the relatively agricultural and rural parts of north Barnet, or other such areas around the edge of London. A scheme need not effect entire boroughs, and could affect only part of them. It could also be different for different parts of London. The benefit of the concept of road charging is that it is an umbrella under which all sorts of beautiful and varied species can walk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has never seen a group of ramblers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that ramblers carry umbrellas, so the hon. Gentleman has obviously never been rambling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Committee debates the principle of road charging, which relates to a couple of groups of amendments, it will understand that giving permissive power is the beginning of the debate and of the working out of a sophisticated model, rather than the end of the debate. I hope that the hon. member for or Ruislip-Northwood will be persuaded that London should be allowed to examine the matter. The schemes in question could have far more merit in some parts of the London than in others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks made by the hon. member for Ealing, North about rambling prompt me to rise. Rambling is a serious issue, and yesterday's statement about the right to roam announced the statutory right of access that will be given to ramblers, which includes common land. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Labour Members may voice their support, but it does not reflect the feelings of people in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministers may not have the answer today, but will they tell the Committee whether London contains any common land? To what extent will the groups that will be set up I cannot remember precisely what they are called—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disappoint the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton by telling him that we do not intend to accept his amendments. First, they are aimed at the wrong location in the Bill. Secondly, they are unnecessary. Thirdly, they are too restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall expand on those comments. First, the clauses that the amendments seek to change empower the mayor or the boroughs to introduce road user and workplace parking charging schemes. Arrangements for use of the proceeds are contained in new schedules 8 and 9, which will be considered soon, so the amendments are not aimed at the right part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendments are unnecessary because we have given a clear undertaking that all the proceeds will be hypothecated for at least 10 years, after which there will be a review and they will be hypothecated for transport purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the amendments are too restrictive, because they would inhibit the mayor or boroughs in some transport spending. For example, support of river bus services might not fall within the definitions set by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Services to bring people into London from outside would not be compatible with services "in Greater London", which is the phrasing in his amendments. For those reasons, we do not accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton said that we were probing two issues, and I accept that it might be better for the amendments to be made elsewhere in the Bill. When we have completed our consideration of the Bill in Committee, where should people look for the definition of the power of the mayor and the authority to apply the revenue stream to, among other things, cycling and pedestrian support? Where will that definition best be placed? It is important that it is in the Bill somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will come to the issue of cycling, which the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster raised and which prompted the hon. Gentleman's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want first to refer briefly to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who is maintaining a single-handed campaign for the right of residents of Hillingdon in particular to drive their cars wherever they want, as often as they want and to cause the maximum road congestion. The hon. Gentleman may regard himself as a defender of civil liberties, but he will not get much sympathy from many people who have to face the problems of excessive vehicle usage and the pollution and congestion that come from it. Measures that discourage people from unnecessary use of the motor car, but which leave the option open for those who want to take it, must be the sensible way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster raised the issue of cycling. I can now say that my hon. Friend the Minister for transport in London and I have followed through the undertaking that we gave him with regard to cycling. We have undertaken to check whether cycling is within the definition of transport facilities and transport services in the Bill. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
are advised that transport facilities and transport services clearly include facilities and services for any means of transport by any type of vehicle or animal, including—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shanks's pony?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not Shanks's pony. They include, for example, buses, trains, cycles and horses. The expression does not, however, unequivocally include facilities and services for pedestrians. That is why there is a specific reference in clause 122 to pedestrians but not to cycling, which is covered by the wider definition of transport facilities and transport services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that reply, without taking us into the intricacies of Connecticut eclipses, satisfies the right hon. Gentleman. I fear not, however, because he is about to rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misreads my facial expression. I am entirely satisfied with his explanation. I am pleased that the scrutiny of the Bill, which is being observed from all quarters, has produced the elucidation that we just heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a different question for the Minister, which also relates to a potential misunderstanding. I think that I am right in saying that in a previous sitting—I have been unable to find the references—a Liberal Democrat member of the Committee said that the 10-year rule had been written into the Bill. Ministers gave a series of commitments in the debate, and I referred to them as an example of the bellman's rule—what I tell you three times is true. I was not aware that the 10-year rule had been written into the Bill, and the purpose of my intervention is to find out whether it has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 16 of new schedule 8, which we shall consider in due course, gives a clear legislative undertaking to reinforce the message that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister gave on the Floor of the House and which I and my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London have repeated in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) raised the issue of cycling, and I hope that my comments satisfied him. He also rightly stressed the flexibility of road user charging schemes, which can accommodate different circumstances in different parts of London. His remarks were probably aimed at the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, whose opposition to the scheme is clearly based on a view of outer London that differs from reality. Serious congestion points exist at many times of the day in for example, the area around Heathrow airport. In such areas, it might be appropriate to consider congestion charging schemes. However, that is a matter not for us but for the mayor and the boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene for a last time to try to tie down the definitions. Given what the Minister said about pedestrian facilities not being expressly included, someone could defend using the revenue stream from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1023</span>
road charging for pedestrian facilities or cycling by using the reference in paragraph 1(1) of new schedule 8 to "relevant transport purpose", which is defined as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any purpose which directly or indirectly facilitates the implementation of any policies or proposals set out in the Mayor's transport strategy".</p></blockquote>
If the mayor has provided for aid or support for pedestrians, as well as for horses and cyclists and so on, then I would hope that that could be included regardless of other provisions in the Bill. Would that be a fair reading of the schedule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our intention is to ensure that the proceeds from congestion charging and non—residential parking charging schemes can be used for the full range of transport purposes that I have described, including those that do not fall within the definition of transport facilities and services—that is, provision for pedestrians. Our aim, which I believe that the hon. Gentleman shares, is to ensure the greatest possible flexibility in using such proceeds for transport purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about countryside access fora and whether the mayor will be involved in their discussions. Obviously, such discussions will take place, as was indicated by the proposals announced yesterday by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. There is still a great deal of work to be done, including a certain amount of mapping. Where that process applies in relation to London, for example in areas of heath or common land, it is appropriate that the London perspective should be dealt with by the mayor and/or the boroughs. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman, and that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has clearly revealed the Government's position, and that is welcome. We are grateful to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for his work in previous sittings, and to the Minister for his clear elaboration of the Government's commitment to cycling and pedestrians. We look forward to discussing that in greater detail during the debate on new schedule 8. In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. As you are a Chairman who is interested in history and tradition, I seek some information. The other day, when I innocently went to the Table Office to table an amendment, I discovered that it was amendment No. 1000, and we are about to have a debate on an amendment which goes beyond that number. Can you tell us, Mr. Winterton, if the Committee is setting a new record—certainly in this Parliament, and possibly in living memory—by dealing with more than 1,000 amendments? If that is so, it may allow us to make some comments about the nature of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that, although it is not really a point of order for me. For the edification of the Committee, I shall seek to ascertain precisely what the position is in relation to the tabling of more than 1,000 amendments to Bills considered by previous Standing Committees. In due course, at an appropriate time, I shall reveal my findings to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1008 in page 104, line 8, leave out "keeping or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am set an historical precedent in moving amendment No. 1008, I am proud that it is a Tory doing so in the face of this iniquitous charge on the freedom and liberties of the people of London—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> There is nothing more iniquitous than the potential enshrined in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 200 provides that the authority—and, now that the clause has been amended, the boroughs—can impose charging schemes not only on the use but also the keeping of motor vehicles on roads in their area. Initially, I thought that it was a draftman's error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps you would allow me, Mr. Winterton, to refer briefly to new schedule 8. Paragraph I defines a charging scheme as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a scheme for imposing charges in respect of the keeping or use of motor vehicles on roads"</p></blockquote>
in a designated area. Thus, there is no mistake in clause 200. Clearly, the charge is not meant to be a road user charge; it is a charge for keeping a vehicle on a road in a designated area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, Mr. Winterton, that you will have read the Government's sub-White Paper, "Breaking the Logjam". Chapter 3 deals with road user charging, and paragraph 3.2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Primary legislation will provide:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>powers to enable traffic authorities (and the Mayor in London), singly or jointly, to introduce a mandatory charge for using a vehicle in or entering a designated area, or for using specified roads".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to give the purposes of such a charge. There is no reference there to a charge for keeping vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know from debates on earlier clauses that at certain times the mayor is bound by national policy, which is defined as something contained in a White Paper or a sub-white Paper. But there is nothing in this white Paper about a road user charge applying to the keeping of a vehicle. Thus, there is a complete tangle in the Bill; something that is decreed to be national policy is being overridden by the clause. 1 am sure that you will be aware of the confusion that that can engender, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government driving at by introducing a road user charge for keeping a vehicle on the road? The provision for a non-residential parking place levy in clause 201 catches the Government out—they want to be able to introduce a residential levy. All I can say is that the Government have been rumbled. It is nothing but subterfuge—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) is tut-tutting in his usual way, but he will have to explain to his constituents why he has voted for this.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1025</span>
Levying a charge for keeping a vehicle in a designated area has nothing to do with solving congestion or easing pollution; it is a tax on the people of London who own motor cars. We already have road taxes, residential parking permits and meters, which are all taxes on the motorist. The Government are seeking through the clause to introduce another tax. In the judgment of Conservative Members, we should not impose a tax on keeping a vehicle on the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably worth mentioning that amendment (o) to new schedule 8 would delete the immobilising provision. We do not think that putting on a clamp is appropriate—a road user charge is primarily for moving vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a double charge on people who park their cars in London. In effect, it is nothing but a tax on the motorist, and the Conservative party opposes it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I put the Question on the amendment, it has been brought to my attention that we should have put the Question on Government amendment No. 988, so I shall use discretion and authority of the Chair to do that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to the hon. Member for Croydon, South for tabling the amendment. It is not quite clear whether he intended it as a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that it is not a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that we need the words that the amendment would delete; we wait to hear what the Minister has to say. It struck me when considering the amendment that local authorities, at least—obviously, not the GLA—may already have the relevant power in the form of their power to establish parking schemes. To all all intents and purposes, such schemes have the same effect on keeping a motor vehicle on the road. I am sure that all members of the Committee have had parking schemes proposed in their constituencies, often with constituents' support. Local authorities can introduce such schemes—obviously, they must publish traffic orders, but they have the power to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government including the relevant words in the Bill to ensure that the GLA will have the power that boroughs already have, or do they have something else in mind? Is the intention to ensure that the GLA or the boroughs can, when setting up such schemes, prevent someone from avoiding road user charges? Different charging mechanisms may be envisaged, one of which is a standing charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all well aware that road excise duty is often avoided by people who use our roads. The Government are right to try to tackle that by other means; perhaps they have that in mind here. They may want to ensure that a parking officer going round a London borough who sees
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
a car parked in the street without a ticket or sign on its windscreen can act to stop the avoidance of road user charges. That may be what lies behind the Government's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that if the provision is designed to be a new tax, separate from parking schemes and the attempt to ensure that road user charges are properly collected, we are against it. We will listen with great attention and care to what the Minister says to discover whether the Government are proposing a stealth tax, or whether it is a genuine proposal, about which we would not be so worried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The indignation of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South was righteous and entirely justified. The provision gives virtually total discretion to the GLA London borough councils and the common council to impose parking charges, or the equivalent, in their roads. The Government's attitude to the motorists of London is now clear: if a vehicle moves, tax it; if it parks at work, tax it. if a poor unfortunate comes home at the end of a hard working day, he is taxed again for parking in the road.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with most socialist measures, it is their own who they are hurting the most—people living in terraced houses, who do not have garages and do not have the benefit of driveways in which to park their vehicles. This is a diabolical measure, which deserves the fullest possible condemnation. Not only will it be bitterly resented, and rightly so, by Londoners, but it will be bitterly resented by those outside London. People who live on the periphery of London will probably park their car just across the greater London boundary—in neighbouring Hertfordshire, for example. Northwood, in my constituency, is divided between Hertfordshire and Middlesex. People will drive from the Middlesex bit and park their cars in the Hertfordshire bit, which will not exactly delight the residents of Hertfordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a half-baked idea. It is an impost upon so many other imposts on the motorist, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South so eloquently pointed out. Of course, inner London boroughs and, I suspect, other London boroughs have ample powers to charge for parking in the roadway. Resident car parking schemes have, with parking meters, been a feature—not always appreciated, but tolerated—of London life for years. But this proposal is quite new. The chances are that it will be abused by the Greater London authority and the boroughs, and even conceivably by the common council, although I doubt that. Nevertheless, it will be abused—of that I am quite sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Londoners will resent the scheme, and they ought to know that its authors were the Minister for London and Construction, the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) and the Minister for Transport in London, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) They produced it in full knowledge of the odium that will be heaped on the local authorities that impose the charges, but the odium will also stick to them and their Government. We will not allow Londoners to forget who sought these powers and provided for these in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood praised the hon. Member for Croydon, South for his righteous indignation in condemning the proposals. The concluding contribution of the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who said—I am paraphrasing—that this was an imposition on the civil liberties and rights of citizens in London rang somewhat hollow. I was not aware that he had carried out such a vociferous attack on the poll tax, which was introduced by the previous Administration. The hon. Gentleman also seems to have had a lapse in memory with regard to our document "Breaking the Logjam". He averred that it does not cover keeping a vehicle on the road. Perhaps he would like to read paragraph 3.5 of the document, which makes it clear that a charge could include one for keeping or driving a vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Croydon, South, for Kingston and Surbiton and for Ruislip-Northwood are confusing what is proposed—essentially a low-technology licencing scheme, possibly paper based—with a parking scheme. Powers already rest with the local authorities to introduce residential schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would rule out something that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and his colleagues have found attractive in the Government's proposals so far—the flexibility of the mayor and the boroughs to introduce schemes in which all moneys raised must be spent on improving transport and delivering the mayor's integrated transport strategy. Clearly, those schemes will play a major role in lifting the burdens of congestion and pollution from the people of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says may be very interesting, and we will await her amplification. However, I seek clarification of an earlier point. Is she saying that the words "keeping or" allow to be brought into the new revenue stream for investment in public transport moneys collected by the GLA, the boroughs or the City of London for parking? In theory, does that not mean that there will be a second tier of parking charge, which will be separate from that which exists in current legislation, where money goes into the coffers of the borough or of the City for its own internal purposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is as confused now as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was earlier. In introducing a road user charging scheme, the mayor should have the ability to introduce low technology—ergo paperbased—schemes, which would define specific areas of London as being closed to entry without the obtaining of a licence. Clearly, the enforcement of such a scheme would require the ability to check. That is why the "keeping" part of paragraph 3.5 of "Breaking the Logjam" is pertinent. It is quite separate from existing schemes, which are parking schemes as far as local authorities are concerned, and relate to residential parking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the logical corollary of the Minister's remarks that residents will be treated in the same way as road users in general? Will not a resident who uses his vehicle only occasionally or does not use it at all be treated in exactly the same way as someone from out of town who travels in and who uses the roads a great deal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1028</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because it will be entirely open for the mayor and boroughs to define exemptions with any scheme. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman understands the powers that the Bill gives to the mayor and to boroughs to introduce schemes directly and immediately to meet the needs of London and Londoners. They will be able to use the ability given to them by the Government to use every penny of money made from road user charging or non-residential parking levies to improve and to deliver the mayor's integrated transport strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be absurd to presuppose that the mayor and boroughs would not need to consult and be cognisant of the possible need for exemptions or variables. Such variables could relate, for example, to times of day or days of the week. It would be absurd for us to try to include such detail in the Bill. The Government have clearly stated that it will not be possible for the mayor and boroughs to double whammy anyone by charging for the same piece of road or licence area twice, and the Bill ensures that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I do not understand the proposal, but Opposition Members understand only too well where she is coming from. She said that residential parking could be dealt with by exemptions. Why the need for exemptions? Why cannot we take away the power from the mayor, and exempt everyone from a charge for parking under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absurd. Of course there will have to be exemptions. One of the most obvious exemptions has been mentioned. Orange badge holders are absolutely dependent on the ability to use their cars to have any sort of life at all. Clearly, the mayor and boroughs will necessarily consult on such issues, and will be cognisant of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would hate the Minister to misunderstand my point. I accept the case for exemptions, but I was saying that if "keeping" was removed from the clause, there would be no need to make an exemption for residential parking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing powers that will be given to the mayor. They are wide ranging and the efficacy of the mayoral strategy is dependent on their flexibility. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the need for research to be undertaken before the mayor introduces a scheme. That research is not available now in the detail that it would be for the mayor, and yet the hon. Gentleman seems to argue that the Committee should begin to detail minutely a scheme for the mayor and boroughs to introduce. It would be absurd to do so. The choices are for the mayor, who will able to assess which is the most direct, effective and efficient scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the Minister's comments needs clarification. She said that local authorities should have discretion to vary charges according to the time of day. She will recognise that we have never accepted the principle of double taxation in this place. A person who keeps his car in the road outside his residence might go from there to his place of work and incur a charge for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
keeping the car at the workplace for eight or 10 hours during the working day. Is the Minister suggesting that there will be a corresponding derogation of the parking fee because that person keeps the car in the road at home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used the word "exemptions." I was actually thinking about the concerns that freight hauliers, for example, have expressed to me about the issue. As far as the time of day is concerned, the mayor may well consider the potential for deliveries to take place only at certain hours during the day. That may well be an area in which the possibility of exemptions can be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I am trying to underline and reiterate is that the amendment would reduce the flexibility of the mayor and the boroughs to introduce comprehensive schemes that would meet the need—and, indeed, the duty that has been placed on the mayor to deliver a transport strategy for London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be completely clear. At the moment, all the boroughs and the City of London can regulate parking throughout their areas. On-street parking is already covered by law—the powers exist. What is not covered by law anywhere in the country is a power to charge for moving along a road and to levy tolls. Road charging, as generally understood, will provide the Greater London authority with a power to charge a vehicle to come into part of London and to move around it. The amendment would remove the power of the mayor and the assembly to have a parking charge and it would leave a driving charge. Do the Government want the mayor and the authority to be able to charge drivers not just as they drive but when they park? All the authorities in London already have a power in regard to parking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the Government propose. On the issue of tolling, there are already areas in the country which are tolled, such as the Severn crossings, the Dartford crossing and Skye bridge. The Birmingham northern relief road will also be tolled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, there seems to be a confusion about what is central and what is inessential. To take the issue of vehicles moving on roads, the most effective way of ensuring that the relevant charges are made will possibly be very high-tech. We are ensuring that the mayor will have the power to introduce a low-tech, paper-based system. People will certainly not stand at the side of the road, ticking off the number of cars. The mayor could, however, license an area of London, and people will have to have the relevant licence to enter it. I refer back to what was advocated by a Minister for Transport in London under the previous Administration, Mr. Steven Norris, who is no longer a Member of Parliament. He suggested that people buy a travelcard or a variation of it. That would give them the right to be in an area that was licensed by the mayor. The amendment would preclude that, which is why we ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister and I accept absolutely the good faith in which she made her comments. However, I still have the deepest reservations about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
way in which the relevant part of the clause is worded. I want to rehearse my concern before commenting on what the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that the Question of parking restrictions should be kept at the local level so far as possible and practicable. In that way, the London boroughs, in this instance, are responsible for parking in their areas and responsive to their electors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system is working well, generally speaking, whether it be parking meters or controlled parking zones, of which there are several in Barnet. Whatever reservations some of my constituents may have had before the controlled parking zones were introduced in Barnet, they are reasonably satisfied now; no one can be entirely satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is not the possible double whammy, whereby a charge paid to the Greater London authority would overlay existing parking restrictions, for which the moneys paid go to the London borough; I am not suggesting that there will be a double charge on existing parking restrictions. However, the clause seems to give power to the mayor or the GLA to impose a blanket charge on all other areas. The Minister says no, but I want to say why I am against the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the consequences of parking restrictions in parts of my constituency, which will he replicated in parts of other constituencies in London, particularly in the outer London boroughs, is that some residents are given an incentive to concrete over their front gardens so as to be able to park their vehicles off-street. That may avoid a parking charge, but it is a distinct environmental minus. It is a real worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Dismore 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I both represent constituencies within the London borough of Barnet, so I am sure that he is aware that the new Labour administration in Barnet has taken a very robust attitude towards applications for cross-overs along the lines that he suggests. While it is certainly a problem in my constituency, as I am sure it is in his, I do not think that it will grow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not understand how it affects my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Minister for Transport in London that many worries and reservations could be overcome if this part of the clause were worded differently. Whatever the hon. Lady's good faith and sincere intentions in recommending the rejection of the amendment—if that is what she is going to do—I believe that the clause gives a sweeping power that could be used and abused in future. I want to register my deep concern about that and to ask the Minister to think again. If she accepted a different wording, which put beyond doubt what she spelt out as being the Government's intentions, it would be for the benefit of London as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I have seen the indignation of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South but also the visible irritation of the Minister, and I do not want to irritate her further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
Nevertheless, I want to echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) said. While I agree with him that the Government's intentions in this respect may be honourable, I am very worried that the provisions might in future be used in a way that the Government would not want it used. I therefore urge them to consider redrafting it so it does not cause such great alarm among Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support what the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet said. We understand what the Minister was trying to say—a paper-based scheme cannot be enforced when cars are moving. The only time one can check whether someone has paid his or her road user charges is when the car is stationary. We support the Government's intentions. If we want to introduce road charging schemes quickly, paper-based schemes are clearly the most appropriate way forward—or could well be. However, the Bill goes much further than that. Now that we have had the debate, I am sure that the Minister can see that. Will she think again and assure us that on Report measures will be tabled that fit exactly with her intentions, but do not give the mayor more power than he or she should have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my remarks, Mr. Winterton, by congratulating you on the manner in which you ensured that we voted on the Government amendment. You showed great imagination and sensitivity during our discussions of the river. It is a well-known characteristic of the river that is outside the windows of the Room that, from certain perspectives, one can easily be mistaken as to which side buildings such as St. Pauls and Canary wharf are on. I warmly congratulate you on the vigilance with which you ensured that the sinuosity of the river did not deceive us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking forward to your confirmation, Mr. Winterton, of whether amendment No. 1008 is in fact a record. Should it turn out to be so, I shall be obliged to draw to the attention of the editor of 	<i>"The Guinness Book of Records",</i> who is an acquaintance of mine, the fact that the Government have tabled a large number of amendments and new schedules. Although that may have been intended to nurse my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South towards his record, it may be felt that the attempt has been nobbled by the Government's contributions. Perhaps that is another reason why they have been doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my hon. Friends in their anxiety about the clause. I should like briefly to introduce into the debate Sir Edward Coke of Leicester, which has already featured in our discussions of road charging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leicester square has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, Leicester square likewise. Sir Edward Coke, who was Leicester's Lord Chief Justice, uttered the great aphorism that an Englishman's home is his castle. My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Croydon, South has extended that from home to car, and has echoed the instincts of all Englishmen in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
The Minister continues to defend the wording of the clause. However, the problem is that if members of the Committee are having difficulty in understanding it, 5 million Londoners—the great majority of whom, as the Minister frequently reminds us, voted for the principles in the White Paper—will also be mystified. I have quoted before Balfour's remark to the effect that Asquith's well-known lucidity of style was a positive disadvantage when he had nothing particular to say. I mean no disrespect to the Minister, who clearly does have something to say, but the manner in which she is responding to Opposition Members confronts us with an opacity which needs resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) that on this occasion Opposition Members would not raise any objection if the Government were to come forward with a new clause or a new schedule to clarify what they are seeking to do. As it is, Londoners are likely to share our view that they are being unreasonably threatened by the wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for coming back to have a blast from the second barrel, but the issue concerns me greatly—especially in the light of the Minister's intervention, which failed to reassure or clarify but which heightened the anxiety on the Opposition Benches. It wholly justified the tabling of amendment No. 1008 by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. One must see this power in the overall context of the circumstances in which it may be levied—both the particular and the general circumstances. Let us consider the particular circumstances of people such as district nurses or social workers who have neither driveways leading to their homes nor garages. They must leave their cars on the road. By the nature of their work, they probably operate from a local authority unit, a hospital or other medical facility, and make residential calls around and about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority invoked the power, such people would face the possibility of paying to keep their vehicle outside their home as well as having to meet the exorbitant rate of motor fuel duty that the Government impose and normal vehicle excise duty. There is the additional cost of car insurance in London, and to keep a car on the road costs more than to keep one in a garage. Such people will presumably also be charged for their residential calls if they cross borough boundaries, and their employers will be charged if staff keep their vehicles at the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impulse to act will lead to sweeping and draconian powers that will impinge heavily on Londoners. More generally, once the powers are on the statute book, the Treasury will say, "The Greater London authority has all the power that it needs to raise the revenue required to ameliorate public transport in London. We will cut off the subsidy, reduce the transport grant and ensure that governmental subventions for London as a whole are kept to a minimum by the precept and, above all, by the new charges. The GLA can raise the revenue necessary." The Automobile Association tellingly raised that point in the briefing that it sent to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1033</span>
I presume that the GLA will have primacy. I am not clear on the matter: that might be my fault, but if it is not, I hope that the Minister will explain the position to the Committee. The subject was touched on tangentially by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. One hopes that charges for keeping a vehicle in the street will be levied by the most local form of authority possible—and in London that is the borough councils. That will ensure that local circumstances are considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The revenue needs of the Greater London authority might be such that the mayor requires swathes of the capital to be areas in which street parking charges should be levied. I presume that he could then impose such charges over the heads of London borough councils, even if they had democratically decided not to impose them. The Minister should clarify that matter because it is important—it is partly why I consider the powers to be undesirable and why I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try again to explain, and I apologise to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster if I obfuscate rather than clarify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood confused the possibility of a mayor introducing a scheme under which car owners and drivers would require a licence to enter an area with the right to park and existing borough parking schemes. He referred to specific professions, but it is likely that such people already pay for street parking under residential parking schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We perceive the word "keeping" as important and necessary for the enforcement of a licence scheme. If that word is not used, only the word "moving" is left, so how can the licensing requirements of a scheme that is not high-tech be enforced? There would be no way of enforcing a low-tech scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the proposal has nothing to do with parking. When the mayor and the boroughs introduce a scheme that requires a permit to enter a defined area of London, a permit will be paid for. That permit will not carry with it an automatic right to park in the area. It will still be necessary to meet the existing parking requirements in that part of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now clearer than she was before. As I understand it, if people do not live in London and travel into London by car, they might be liable, under the present proposals in the Bill, for two charges—the Londonwide charge for road use that might be in force when the vehicle is stationary, and the potential local scheme that would require payment for a parking bay. If local people have a resident's parking permit and park outside their house or in their street, they will not be liable for any additional charge unless the vehicle is used, and is seen to be used, to travel to another part of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The hon. Gentleman is correct in his summation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns that have been expressed by members of the Committee. Although I am not prepared to accept the amendment, if what I have said has not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
reduced their anxieties I will obtain more detailed justification for the retention of the word "keeping" to ensure that the enforcement of the scheme will be possible and practicable. However, I will also inquire whether another word can meet the same enforcement requirement as the words currently in the Bill and can do so without causing concern to Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my comments will be helpful to the Minister. They follow the points made by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, will the Minister accept that, when we discuss the schedules that amplify and define the proposals, we can then clarify the concept of use of motor vehicles? My instinct about definition is that she is referring to the use of vehicles in a road charging scheme. It may be preferable to remove the concept of paying for remaining stationary from this part of the Bill and introduce it elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the example of a scheme based on a licence to enter an area, the licence is not for parking. If an area is entered, the parking requirements of that area must be met. The licence will enable a vehicle to enter an area, but, as we are not proposing electronic enforcement schemes, it must be possible to ensure that enforcement can apply not only to "moving" but to "keeping" a vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not prepared to accept the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, and I am not prepared to take it away and consider it further. In the light of the concerns that have been expressed I will reassure myself that the word "keeping" is the absolutely correct word to ensure that enforcement will be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that in the Minister's eyes I am being obtuse but let us simplify the issue. If an individual leaves his car in a street in perpetuity—with a valid vehicle excise disc attached, of course—is there anything to stop the GLA using the power under the clause to impose a charge on that individual for leaving his car outside his house? Notwithstanding the fact that his local authority may have a different idea, might not he face a charge that could be applied only because the mayor had the power given under the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Those powers already rest with the boroughs. It is entirely open for boroughs to introduce resident parking schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson.</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> What about the mayor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not really discussing the issue of parking; we are discussing obtaining a licence to enable a car driver to enter a defined area. Once in that area, the requisite parking requirements will come into force, but that is an entirely separate matter from any mayoral scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister one last thing to think about? The reason that we are in a muddle derives from the wording of clause 200, which states that the Secretary of State, which we have altered to the mayor,
	<br><blockquote><p>"may…make provision for and in connection with the establishment and operation by or on behalf of"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
the listed authorities—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of schemes for imposing charges in respect of the keeping or use of motor vehicles".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would provide that such charges would be in respect only of the use of motor vehicles. They may be made by means of the parked vehicle, but they are charges only in respect of its use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider the drafting, because I think that the words "or keeping" should not be included. Keeping—the stationary use of a vehicle—should be a means of collection and enforcement, not a method of triggering a charge; from what the Minister has said, charges will be for use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given the Committee an assurance that I will examine whether the word "keeping" delivers the desired outcome. I believe that it does, for the reason that I have already given: it will enable enforcement, should the mayor decide to introduce an area licensing scheme. In the light of that commitment, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will choose to withdraw the amendment. I will return to the Committee when I have completed my investigation into whether the word that I believe delivers the desired outcomes in fact does so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's assurance does not go far enough. It is perfectly clear from the contributions made by virtually every Opposition Committee member that there is concern about the clause. It is quite possible for the wording to be misinterpreted. The simple fact is that a resident who lives in the middle of a designated area could be subject to the charge even if he did not use his car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a point that the hon. Gentleman has already raised. As I have said, it is within the powers of the mayor and the boroughs when devising any scheme to consider concerns such as those that the hon. Gentleman has put to me, and to provide exemptions. The purpose of including the word "keeping" is to underline the difference between keeping and moving. How could a scheme to licence vehicles entering a particular area be enforced if the clause referred only to moving? That is the purpose of the reference to keeping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is where the Minister and I disagree. I do not want the mayor to have the discretion to introduce an exemption. She may want to leave it to the mayor, but I do not trust the mayor not to introduce the scheme in all the circumstances that may come to bear. That is the root of our disagreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend insists on that point. Are not the Government proposing a tax upon ownership of a vehicle? One could have to pay a charge for leaving a vehicle unused outside the front door? That is the effect of the mayoral power that the Government want the Bill to retain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. He may not have heard, but during his intervention the Minister spoke from a sedentary position, saying that I—I think that she was referring to me—did not want any exemptions. That is not correct, and we shall come to our
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
specific proposals in a minute. The Minister will see that we have proposed some exemptions for subsequent clauses. I do not want the mayor to have discretion on the specific exemption under discussion, while the hon. Lady is suggesting that he should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is of fundamental importance. In her opening speech, the Minister spoke about my remarks on civil liberties. I was speaking not about the amendment in particular but about the fact that the clause erodes the right of Londoners to drive their cars on the roads of London. That is a fundamental point. I should dearly love to press the amendment to a vote, but I should like even more to raise the matter on Report. We have had a modest canter round the course, and it will be appropriate to refer to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you, Mr. Winterton, joined the Committee, Mr. O'Hara had in some detail defined the complexities inherent in this part of the Bill for hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1046</span>
Members' benefit. In the light of that complexity, I trust that it will be in order for me to speak at some length about the amendment and new schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment renames schedule 13 as the "Road user charging" schedule. The new schedule contains details of how such schemes will be implemented and of how they will operate. If the Committee agrees, it will stand as schedule 8 to the Bill. It contains important provisions for the arrangement of road user charging schemes brought forward by the mayor and by the boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister were the mayor of London, would she introduce a road user charge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a word, yes. The Government have taken the radical and innovative step of ensuring that a dedicated income stream will specifically, exclusively and transparently be spent to improve transport for Londoners. I would be proud to play any part in introducing that, as I am today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty in understanding the pride that the Minister evinces. Will she reassure the Committee, however, that the legislation contains protection in the context of additionality? I say that against the background of our rows over the Government's interpretation of additionality in the context of the lottery. Londoners already make a massive contribution to the national economy and they will not be pleased if they are going to be taxed more highly simply so that the Government can reduce the amount that they spend on transport in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can categorically assure and, indeed, reassure the right hon. Gentleman that moneys raised from revenue charging schemes and private non-residential parking levies—100 per cent, of the net proceeds of which will be hypothecated and spent on delivering the mayor's integrated transport strategy—will be in addition to moneys from central Government which will go to Transport for London. As an added reassurance, there will be a requirement on the mayor and the boroughs to publish annual and quite separate accounts showing money coming in and money going out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the Minister said is helpful, but can she point to the legislative cover in the Bill which states that those funds will be additional?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am being asked for the precise number of the schedule, I will give that to the right hon. Gentleman in a moment. As I said, I intend to speak at some length on new schedule 8, so I shall certainly come back to the right hon. Gentleman with that piece of information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats tabled an amendment that would have included in the Bill the sorts of legislative safeguards that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster seeks, but the Government rejected it and, indeed, the principle behind it. It is clear that the Bill does not contain such safeguards. I hope that the Minister will respond to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1047</span>
The reason that the Minister can still say that the funds will be additional is because her Government have not allowed for any money to go to London Transport in the years when the mayor will be operating it. They have abolished central Government public support for London Transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman already has the award for making the most absurd statements either in Committee or on the Floor of the House; he has no need to try to win stars and bars with that ridiculous remark. The Government have made it abundantly clear, despite the protestations of the official Opposition about what they deem to be a black hole between the negotiation of the public-private partnership and the public-private partnership passing to the mayor, that we would not allow London Transport and the need of Londoners to be transported on their underground system to fall into a black hole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to a black hole, but after her statement last week that the public-private partnership would be subsidised by funds from central Government, she has to a large degree filled in that black hole and it is no longer a mystery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman somewhat recreates what I said. I clearly remember saying that should the modelling prove to be over-confident as regards the public-private partnership, there would be the power for moneys to go to Transport for London to ensure that the underground system in this city ran. Ours is a completely different approach from that of the previous Administration, who, as we know, significantly failed for more than a decade to meet the needs of London's underground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want properly to complete the set of interventions from Opposition Members by putting to the Minister the undertaking that London First—as well as Opposition Members—sought. First, can she say categorically that none of the proceeds of road user charging will be used to support the public-private partnership for London Underground and that there will be no transfer for that purpose? Secondly, can she indicate, to pick up the point made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, the minimum amount of funding for transport in London that she and her colleagues have secured on a continuing basis from the Exchequer. Given that London pays more per head into the national kitty than any other region, the right hon. Gentleman's point is of huge importance. Has the Treasury given the Minister's Department any assurances or are we to assume that there may be absolute substitution of Treasury subsidy for moneys raised specially in London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman was asking in a rather complicated way whether the Government intend the powers that the mayor and the boroughs will be given to relieve them of the responsibility for funding the operations that will form Transport for London, I can give him the most categorical no. That is not what the Government intend. I will get back to the hon. Gentleman on the precise amounts. As he knows, TfL will be responsible for London buses, river buses, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1048</span>
docklands light railway, the mayoral roads and for delivering an integrated transport strategy for London. Similarly, LT will host the completion—we believe that it will be the successful completion—of the public-private partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question whether the mayor will ever be precluded from using revenues from road user charging, why would the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey want to preclude the mayor, many decades into the century, from using such revenues to expand the underground? Is the hon. Gentleman seriously saying that he wants the mayor to be precluded, for example, from using revenue charges to introduce new lines on the underground or to extend existing ones? I cannot believe that that is what he means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was referring not to that but to the danger of the Government's public-private partnership not raising enough money from the private sector. In that case, it could look to a third source to make up the necessary total—namely, the revenue stream from road user charging or any other sources in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fantasy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that is a fantasy, and I repeat it for the record. I am grateful that that is there as an assurance that there is no expectation that the money will be used as a substitute for public or private money, which is the basis of the PPP scheme, which the Minister described a couple of weeks ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is defining a fantasy to the Committee. The Government have consistently said that the overriding principle that will inform all our decision-making processes with regard to the public-private partnership is that it delivers best value for the general public. I am already on the record as saying that the modelling on which the contracts that will eventually be submitted to the private sector are based is entirely within figures for London Underground. London Underground is already seeing excessive profits, as far as revenues ate concerned—the figure is about £300 million a year. It will be entirely possible to fund the PPP without any additional support from the Government. In addition, we have said that, should that modelling prove over-confident, it will, of course, be entirely right and proper for the mayor to have the power, via central Government, to ensure that the PPP contracts deliver the services that we perceive for Londoners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister said that because it confirms what she said the other day. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it represents good value for money, central Government grant to TFL will be based on the assumption that part of the total will be needed to meet London Underground's payments to the PPP contractor."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 23 February 1999; c. 755.]</p></blockquote>
It is clear that the Minister has left open the possibility that PPP may not be self-financing and that Government money will be used to make up the deficit. If that is the case, is not the entire PPP ethos collapsing as we sit here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman would like those to be the facts, but I must reassure him—or, rather, disappoint him—by saying that nothing could be further from the truth. We have consistently said, and I say it again, that the PPP is on track and on time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1049</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did the Minister say what she said, then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the process that is being engaged in at the moment. We have consistently said that we will not be driven by some artificially defined end date. We will be motivated only by delivering a PPP that is in the best possible public interest and delivers best value. However, I repeat that there is an unlikely possibility that modelling could have been over-confident. If that proved to be the case, it would be entirely right and proper, as the Government have taken responsibility for taking the PPP through to its successful conclusion, that the sort of arrangements to which the hon. Gentleman referred would be put in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and I am grateful for the Minister's amplification of the principle. However, what would happen if there was a deficit? Before putting in Government money, would the Government say to the mayor, "You must use road user charging money first?" What would be the order in which drawdowns were taken to prop up the PPP?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, the possibility of the PPP having to be propped up, to use the hon. G's phrase, is remote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is only an assumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a remote possibility because, in terms of the PPP, the Government are motivated by making decisions that deliver best value, are in the public interest and give the taxpayer the best possible value for money. That will inform the entire decision-making process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer a very simple question? In what order will money—Government money, road user charging levies and parking levies—be drawn down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have said that there is a clear responsibility with regard to such a scenario, which we believe to be entirely unlikely. We have also made it abundantly clear that the net proceeds of the road user charging levy and the non-residential parking levy are for the exclusive and direct purpose of delivering the mayoral integrated transport strategy. Decisions on delivering that integrated transport strategy will be for the mayor to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is very important, and that is why the Minister is being asked so many questions. What is there to protect the budget of the mayor and assembly for the purposes of the transport requirements, in future years, of London Underground, given that there will be contractual on-payments for the PPP? The mayor and the assembly will not be able to take part in the decision on the contract—the Minister said that that will be done by Government and the private sector. What, therefore, will ensure that all the money does not have to be spent on sustaining the public sector contribution to the PPP project, and that all of the revenue stream will therefore be diverted to that, even though in theory the mayor has discretion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1050</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have stated clearly at least four times this morning that the Government's approach to the PPP is that it must deliver best value. We are committed to ensuring that the PPP will be entered into only if it meets the Government's overriding requirement—that of delivering best value for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other concern that was expressed, there is a clear duty placed upon the mayor to deliver safe, efficient, affordable transport to, from and within London. It would not be possible for the mayor to be able to meet that duty, which the Bill places upon him or her, if he or she suddenly decided, to paraphrase the hon. Gentleman, to raid all the other budgets. Possibly, not because of any kind of drama—we do not believe in the kind of scenario presented by the hon. Member for Croydon, South—a mayor could decide that they wished to pursue an extreme form of transport that would be enormously expensive. As I have just explained, the mayor will be precluded from doing that, in any context, because of the overriding duty to deliver transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have got to the heart of the issue. There are many duties that local authorities are meant to fulfil but do not. The social services department in my local authority has a duty to give people bath rails, but it does not. My housing benefit service is meant to process housing benefit claims within seven days, but it certainly does not—seven weeks, perhaps, or sometimes seven years. The fact that a duty exists is a complete distraction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is outrageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not outrageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is outrageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be distracted, Mr. Winterton. Let me say to the Minister that that is not an answer. If the mayor and the authority were not subject to the Secretary of State's capping powers, it might in theory be possible for the mayor to raise the money. But if the Secretary of State says, "You will spend no more than this", and all the money has to be spent on the underground—the Minister has not given me an undertaking that it will not—the duty is as thin as the paper on which it is written.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said from a sedentary position that I believed the hon. Gentleman's comment to be outrageous, and it is. He has seriously proposed that the people of London would elect as their directly chosen mayor someone with so little regard for the duties that have been placed on him or her not only by the Bill but by the clear desires of the people of London, for whom an improvement in transport is at the top of the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also safeguards in the Bill to ensure that any transport strategy that the mayor proposes will be closely scrutinised by the assembly. There will be a requirement for that to be published. If that strategy is not being delivered, I have little doubt that not only the people of London but the assembly would draw the mayoral attention to that fact. It would be impossible for any mayor to raid the Transport for London budget in that way, to prioritise one strand of a transport strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1051</span>
The hon. Gentleman chose the example of the tube, because that fits his particular black fantasy. It could apply equally to buses on the river, buses on our roads, the docklands light railway and any other aspect of the mayoral responsibility which must be worked at together to deliver the duties that are imposed on the mayor with regard to an integrated transport strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can always detect when the Minister is on weak ground, because she starts waving her arms around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that I have got to the heart of the matter or that I have had an answer to any question. May I put it to the hon. Lady in another way? Let us suppose that the mayor is elected on a manifesto pledge not to introduce road user charging. I respect the hon. Lady's confidence that the underground will be self-financing, but she has left open the possibility that it may not be. I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that it will not be self-financing. Given that, the Minister has made it quite clear that Government money will be used. Will she respect the mayor's pledge not to introduce road user charging, and use Government money to make up the shortfall of the PPP?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powers being given to the mayor are enabling powers. Let us suppose that a person campaigning to be mayor said that he or she would refuse the potential financial resource that the Government were giving to the incumbent, giving a clear promise that all moneys raised could be spent in only one area—that moneys raised from road user charging and a private non-residential levy must be used exclusively for improving transport in London. A person campaigning to be mayor who ran on a ticket of refusing, now or in the future, to use a source of revenue that could assist in the transformation of London's transport scheme would be highly unlikely to be elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is talking about highly unlikely scenarios. I think that it is quite likely that a mayor would get elected on a pledge not to introduce road user charging. We have not dealt with non-residential parking yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I want is a simple answer to this question. If the mayor does not introduce road user charging during his term of office, and if there is a shortfall in the PPP, what will the Government do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate what I have told the hon. Member for Croydon, South twice this morning, and previously in Committee. Should the modelling of the PPP prove to be over-optimistic—which is highly unlikely—the Government have made it clear that there would be funding to ensure that the underground continued to run. The Government have made abundantly clear their commitment to London and the underground, in marked contrast to the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My enthusiasm, which the hon. Gentleman calls waving my arms around, is not because I feel myself to be on thin ground, but because he is being somewhat churlish in not acknowledging our major breakthrough
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
concerning hypothecation of revenue. His Government proposed such charges, but did not manage to go that extra step to ensure that every penny of net proceeds so raised could be used exclusively for the improvement of transport in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be my last intervention on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will. The Minister has not given a straight answer to the question, so I assume that she does not know the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question more than once. He failed to ask this, but if his concern is that the Secretary of State would have power to overrule a mayor who had chosen to campaign on a manifesto stating that he would never introduce congestion charging or a private non-residential parking levy, there are no such powers for the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to table an amendment to provide that the net proceeds of road charging for the first 10 years could be used for any public transport purpose in London, excluding support for the London underground PPP, would the Government accept it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I did not hear what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was distracted, if we were to table an amendment to the effect that the net proceeds—to use the Government's words—of the road charging scheme for the first 10 years, again taking the Government's parameters, could be used for any relevant transport purpose in London, excluding the private-public partnership funding of the London underground, would she accept it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be an utterly irrelevant amendment. The public-private partnership will over a long period attract billions of pounds into London underground. Road user charging and a private non-residential parking levy will give the mayor a revenue stream that may be used only and exclusively to further the mayor's transport strategy, so such an amendment would have no purpose. Equally, I would not accept the placing of such a limitation on the mayor, so I would not be prepared favourably to consider such an amendment, which would be utterly irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the PPP will bring in billions of pounds for private sector contractors. Will she tell the Committee how those private sector contractors will be paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that the modelling performed by consultants made it clear that such contracts can be met from revenues—that is within the parameters of the modelling. There appears to be a marked level of confusion in the hon. Gentleman's mind about how the contracts will be awarded. We have made it abundantly clear that they will he offered and that those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
who wish to tender will be required to compete. It is a competitive situation. The contracts will be agreed to only when the Government are reassured and absolutely clear that the taxpayer will receive best possible value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McDonnell	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hayes and Harlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any attempt at this stage to restrict the mayor's future opportunities to evolve the PPP process—about which I must say I am sceptical—would present a limitation that would disable any future mayor and administration. It may well be that the PPP evolves into opportunities for further developments and improvements in the system, so I would urge hon. Members not to table amendments of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Confidence in the PPP process will be tested over the coming years. As it stands, the legislation will allow the mayor—and the assembly if necessary—to go back to the electorate on the evolution of that process, and we do not want their hands to be fettered at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may now return to amendment No. 989. The arrangements that will apply to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
retention and use of net revenues from road user charging will also apply to revenues raised from the workplace parking scheme. With your permission, Mr. Winterton, I should like to set out those arrangements in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me, but if she intends to give a detailed response to the amendment, perhaps it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we were to adjourn debate until 5.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I have ever heard that sort of intervention on a Minister of the Crown, but with just four minutes of the sitting to go, I believe that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to accept the motion that the Government Whip has proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
