It falls to me to issue the courteous and conventional—but none the less heartfelt—welcome to you as Chairman of the Committee. We wish you well, and I am sure that the Committee will help you in your task in every way that it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise a point of order on the implications of the Committee being unable to sit during the short recess in February which was announced by the Leader of the House. The matter was touched on briefly at the Committee's previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee already has constraints on its time, me Bill is large and our sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays are already truncated, if not to say leisurely. Surely it would be the wish of the Committee to provide additional time to make up for the time lost because the Committee will not sit on a Thursday in February. I was assured that a proposal would come forward in the fullness of time, so I raise the matter again. I do not expect a response immediately, but I would like reassurance that the Committee's time will not, yet again, be reduced and that all Back Benchers on the Committee will be given the chance to scrutinise the Bill properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the Committee could sit at the time in question, but it is not a matter for the Chair to decide—it is a matter for discussion between the parties.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
	<p>No. 144, in page 12, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(2A) A person shall be disqualified from becoming (whether by election or otherwise) or remaining Mayor of a member of the Assembly if he holds a politically restricted post under any local authority whose area, or any part of it, lies within Greater London.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(2B) For the purposes of subsection (3) above, "politically restricted post" and "local authority" have me same meaning as in Part I of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.'.</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I, too, welcome you Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair. Although amendment No. 232 is me lead amendment, I shall also speak to amendment No. 233, which was also tabled by the Liberal Democrats, and amendment No. 144, which was tabled by Conservative Members. However, I will refer to the Conservative's amendment only in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are examining the part of the Bill that determines how people can qualify to stand either as mayor or members of the assembly. Our amendment would ensure that individuals who are paid by the Government—except those who have already been elected to office—would not be able to stand for election as members of the assembly or mayor. Clause 20 states:
	<br><q><p>"A person is disqualified from being elected … if—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) he is a member of staff of the Authority"</p></q>
—that is self-evident and is perfectly proper and unarguable—and if
	<br><q><p>"(b) he holds any offices or appointments for the time being designated by the Secretary of State in an order as offices or appointments disqualifying persons from being the Mayor or an Assembly member".</p></q>
We have two objections to the way that the clause is drafted. The Bill should set out who should be disqualified; it should not be left to the Secretary of State to decide. We call all contemplate the fact that, if we leave that power to a Secretary of State, it is open to him or her to decide—not necessarily this year or next year but in the future—to rule out certain categories of people. We must resist—I appeal now to Labour colleagues on the Committee—giving such power to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members may think that the current proposal is fine and that the Secretary of State in power is cuddly, likeable and absolutely pluralist in his attitude. However, me Secretary of State may change, Labour may be in opposition and mere may be a Secretary of State who may act against the interests of what is now—albeit temporarily—the majority party. It is important that Secretaries of State are not allowed to behave in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if the power remains, the Secretary of State could decide that no peers could stand for election. That would be completely unjustified if it had not been the view of the Committee or Parliament. The Secretary of State could decide that no former members of the Greater London council could stand, which would be completely unacceptable and illogical. The Secretary of State could also decide that non-Labour councillors could not stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds better and better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am receiving plaudits from the west end of London, if not the west end of the west end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confused about my end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never know whether the hon. Gentleman's constituency is Ealing, North, South, East or West, but I know that it is in west London. For those of us who live in the real London, it is certainly far out west.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, but later and after I have given way to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). First, I must say that it is unacceptable that powers will be given to the Secretary of State to decide—irrespective of logic or natural justice—who shall be excluded from standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aiming to start the new day with a sense of conciliation and of consensus politics—something proposed for London in the Government's White Paper—although we think that co-operative politics are more appropriate than consensus politics. We will shortly ask Labour members of the Committee to gently agree with us. They must begin to flex their muscles in Committee and tell their Ministers that they will not give the Secretary of State one power too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is talking about how the Secretary of State might abuse the powers set out in the Bill. Will the Secretary of State be able to disqualify someone who on one day gives a loyalty pledge to the Prime Minister that he will work with the Government if he is elected mayor, and the next day—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is introducing extraneous matters into the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We defer to you, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure, but it is possible that my hon. Friend's suggestion could be true. More realistically, it is possible for any category of people to be excluded. Subsection (1) (b) refers to the
	<br><q><p>"offices or appointments disqualifying persons".</p></q>
If offices or appointments are the criteria for exclusion, any office or appointment that a person holds—unless such posts are better defined—could be covered by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one more point before I give way to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). Conventional in drafting, as I remember from past legislation, is the inclusion of a suggestion such as that in our amendment. Amendment No. 232 refers to offices
	<br><q><p>"of profit under the Crown".</p></q>
That is entirely proper. When my predecessor, the late Bob Mellish, was considering whether he should resign from the House having already resigned from the Labour party in protest in the early 1980s, he was also considering whether he should accept nomination for the vice-chair of the London Docklands development corporation. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
that body existed, it was specified as being an office of profit under the Crown, and there are others. Such offices are appointments made through patronage by the Prime Minister. It is true that many are in the gift of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and me Regions and of other Cabinet Ministers, but the majority are in the gift of the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better and, of course, right that there should be no one on the Greater London Authority, either as mayor or in the assembly, who has what may be a conflict of interest. Such conflicts of interest should exclude him or her from participation on that body. I now give way to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Although the moment has passed, he will recall that he was not wholly complimentary to an area of my constituency—I am referring to the west end. I offer him a pact: if he desists from insulting my constituency, I will desist from revealing to the Committee the price paid by the Corporation of London for Southwark in an earlier century, as well as the reasons why that price might have been paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee would like that information. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will manage to provide it without the Chairman noticing. I was not at all rude about the right hon. Gentleman's constituency. He and I, and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)—plus a few others in the Committee—represent real London. Other members of the Committee represent the suburbs, or constituencies halfway to France.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned, as no doubt others will be, about the idea that—according to the Liberal Democrats—"real London" does not include constituencies outside the central area. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will either change the Liberal Democrats' policy towards outer London or make it clear that they realise that the Bill covers all those living within the Greater London area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that I am wearing a Middlesex county cricket club tie, indeed a Simon Hughes benefit tie, given to me by my great namesake—a much greater Simon Hughes than I—luring his halcyon days at Lord's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not only enjoyed but appreciated outer London—but it is not the same. I used to work a lot in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I appeared frequently at Uxbridge magistrates court 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—fortunately in a representative rather than an indicted capacity. The other Liberal Democrat Members on the Committee would be unhappy if I suggested that the Surrey parts, or the Middlesex parts, of London were not valid in their own right. I have made many speeches saying that there is the traditional old London, and then there are the counties that make up Greater London. The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) represents part of one such county, not in the middle but out on the edge of London. It is none the less valid for that, and equally to be incorporated in the Greater London authority.

The Bill is not clear about the Government's intention relating to people who have been elected to public office, and whether they should be entitled to stand as members of the assembly or as mayor. At present, people elected elsewhere can stand for local government; Members of the House of Lords and Members of the House of Commons can be local councillors. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) is still a local councillor, although only someone so capable as he is can say how he manages to fulfil his little constituency obligations and do his parliamentary duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been the case that people from all tiers of government—Members of the European Parliament, Members of Parliament from both Houses, and councillors—can stand for other representative bodies. In the legislation relating to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it was accepted that people could have a dual mandate—that is, that they could stand for two bodies. Our amendment seeks to make it clear that that will be possible under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave it to the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), or one of his hon. Friends, to deal with politically restricted posts, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam may also wish to speak on that matter. I hope that the Government will be positive and accept at least the spirit of the amendments. I hope that they will take them away and, if necessary, redraft them. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is suggesting that they will not. I am unhappy about that, and I hope that he will not defend the Secretary of State's having the power to make an order. That is another example of giving a power to an individual, against the best interests of the people of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 provides the same safeguards against twin tracking as were introduced by the previous Government under the local government regime. However, we feel that they should go further and cover people operating in politically restricted posts in local government boroughs inside London. Our amendment strictly follows the wording of section 2 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. We believe that there is justification for introducing safeguards against a clash of political and public interest, and that should also apply to the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I support amendments Nos. 232 and 233 tabled by the Liberal Democrats and, of course, amendment No. 144 which stands, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. As our consideration of the Bill unfolds, we see that the Government wish to enshrine a pattern of intrusive behaviour in the statute designed to establish the authority. The clause could permit the Secretary of State to disqualify a particular individual by virtue of any undefined appointment that he or she may hold. I find that provision fundamentally undemocratic and offensive to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have any such potential list of appointments for which they would seek disqualification, that ought to be spelt out in the legislation, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) made clear. It ought to be spelt out, first as a matter of equity so that persons who harbour aspirations for elected office, either as a mayor or an assembly man, do not find themselves disappointed, but secondly, so that the general public know what the criteria are. In earlier debates, we saw that the Bill permitted political parties unnecessary power over the selection of candidates; now the Secretary of State has the potential to interfere in matters that must be made clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the category in amendment No. 233— exemption for elected offices—is wholly sensible and right. The mayoralty and the assembly could both benefit from the experience of personalities elected to other offices. For example, on Second Reading the Conservative party explained that it wished to see borough council representatives on the assembly. We argued that point long and hard, because we felt that individual boroughs' points of view would not get across sufficiently in the assembly unless there were such a provision. The amendment would explicitly and clearly prevent there being any question of an elected representative—a borough councillor within London, for example—being disqualified either from the assembly or, conceivably, from the mayoralty, although I doubt whether a person could hold both mandates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 232 would deal with offices
	<br><q><p>"of profit under the Crown".</p></q>
The tradition of our parliamentary process has been to seek the Chiltern Hundreds, because if we take up such an office, the conflict of interests is clear and unacceptable; so it should be for the assembly. There should be no question of any person being able to be bought by the Government through his or her acceptance of an office of profit under the Crown. Again, I welcome the clarity that the amendment spells out for that category of exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 144 has a clarity of definition that is wholly to be welcomed. It accords with previous local government legislation, and I support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must return to the point because it is fundamental, especially now, when a Prime Minister has voiced an opinion on who might be suitable for the post of coach to the England football team—and so much the more when it comes to politics. We have seen how sensitive the Government are over the choice of candidates for office. They will be particularly keen to see appropriate people

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
chosen. Therefore there is a danger of intrusion by the Secretary of State, unless we amend the Bill in the manner set out by the Liberal amendments, Nos. 232 and 233.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair of the Committee. You are me third Chairman that we have had in as many sittings. That, perhaps, is a sign of the arduousness of the task. I welcome the crisp and business-like way in which you have addressed your responsibilities during me first few moments of the sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendments, and I will spell out why. The concern that appears to lie behind them—that the Secretary of State would use his or her order-making powers to disqualify sitting Members of Parliament, councillors or others whom he or she chose to finger, from standing for election either for mayor or for membership of the assembly—is entirely misplaced. I can assure hon. Members that we have no intention of doing any such thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to apply rules that are the same as, or broadly similar to, those that currently apply to local authorities. Under those rules, a person is disqualified from being elected as a member of a local authority if he or she holds any paid office or employment with a body, appointments to which are or may be made, or confirmed, by the authority. That would mean, for example, that members of me board of Transport for London or me board of the London development agency—other man where we have made specific provision for elected members—who will be appointed by the mayor, and their senior employees, could not stand for election either as mayor or as assembly members without first resigning from those positions. I am sure that all members of the Committee will recognise that that is clearly sensible and necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Senior officers of the GLA are already disqualified if they hold politically restricted posts. The other categories of office holders that I would expect to see included in an order made under the provisions of clause 20(1)(b) include some of those listed in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, such as civil servants, acting returning officers, full-time police officers and members of the regular armed forces. I am sure that all members of the Committee will recognise the good sense of those measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the Government's intention, why does the Bill not say that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will surely recognise after his many years of experience in the House of Commons, those matters are already specified by procedures in existing local government legislation that the Bill parallels. If the hon. Member wishes us to rewrite all legislation that applies to local government for the purposes of the Bill, he would have us in Committee a great deal longer than we expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to dissent, but the Minister is wrong on me first point. He listed two categories. One is dealt with under the House of Commons Disqualification Act; he is correct about that. A reference could be made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
in the Bill specifically to the categories mentioned in that Act. The other category is not mentioned elsewhere in legislation. As he has often said, the assembly will be a unique body. He has defined those who might have an interest because they work for or are engaged by one of me agencies. Provisions covering them could be written into the Bill without difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who has been in me House for many years, will appreciate that although it is possible to cover posts such as those that I have mentioned—in the LDA or Transport for London—it is not possible to cover bodies that may come into existence that may have a relationship to the GLA analogous with that that Transport for London and the LDA will have. Any measure such as the one that he proposes would be unsatisfactory as it would subsequently require the amendment of primary legislation rather than any amendment to order-making powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has detained the Committee for a great deal of time already. I will give way to him for the last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says. However, that can be defined either by the Bill or by reference to a specifically defined order under the Bill. This part of me Bill does not limit those who are disqualified to the two categories that he mentioned, the first of which consists of those who are linked to the GLA. It could do so, however, and I still have not heard an argument as to why it should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is pushing his luck by proceeding again and again on the same tack. I have made it clear that his point flies in me face of existing provision for disqualification in respect of local government, which properly takes account of the fact that one cannot change primary legislation for every body or post that is created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the hon. Gentleman's paranoid fears about the Government's intentions, I should make it clear that any order that is made under the powers in clause 20 will be subject to the affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament and will, therefore, be subject to proper and full scrutiny. In the circumstances, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 144, which was tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), is unnecessary. Clause 57(1) already specifies that the GLA shall be treated as a local authority for the purposes of sections 1 to 3 of me Local Government and Housing Act 1989—the provisions that govern politically restricted posts in local authorities. Section 1(1) of the Act states:
	<br><q><p>"A person shall be disqualified from becoming (whether by election or otherwise) or remaining a member of a local authority if he holds a politically restricted post under that local authority or any other local authority in Great Britain".</p></q>
Any person who held a politically restricted post in a London borough would, therefore, already be prohibited from being elected or serving as mayor or as an assembly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
member. Indeed, the prohibition extends to holders of politically restricted posts in local authorities outside Greater London. That is the normal local government regime. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister. I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the doubt is so excessive in this case that I cannot do so. He declared that he intended his successors to use the powers in clause 20(1)(b) in an entirely responsible manner. Obviously, we would not malign the Minister's own intentions, but his reassurance is not sufficient for me. Nor should it be sufficient for anyone who wants the assembly to be established in such a way that there is no possibility of any future Government misusing their powers to disqualify a person from office as mayor or as an assembly man by virtue of any appointment that he might hold. If the Government were benign in their intentions, they could spell out the categories of potential restrictions much more clearly in the Bill. The question of elective office is important. Any possibility of disqualification for Members of Parliament, peers, Members of the European Parliament and, perhaps above all, borough councillors should be clearly excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's argumentation is deficient. We are discussing an important point of principle. Furthermore, there has been an implicit argument throughout that we must get on. That is because the timetable, which the Government themselves set, is so inadequate. It seems that we must give the Bill insufficient and hasty scrutiny because we have to gallop on. We must stop that galloping and reflect on matters so that we ensure that the assembly is properly constituted and that there are no loopholes that future Governments can abuse. I therefore support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I did not hear the Minister deal explicitly with the point about the dual mandate. If I misheard him or was not attending when he did, I apologise. It would, however, be helpful if he could comment on the matter. My understanding is that the Government agreed to dual mandates in Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislation. The only exception is that one cannot be a member of the Scottish executive and of the British Cabinet, but that is a more particular point, which does not relate to the general issue. Will the Minister clarify the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to make it clear that we have no intention—as we have already said—of using order-making powers to prevent people from standing for membership of the Greater London Authority or as mayor of the authority while they hold other political posts—for example, as Members of Parliament or as councillors. That is entirely up to those concerned. There are obvious questions as to whether people can reasonably do two exacting jobs, but we do not intend to prevent from standing people who wish to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful, Mr. O'Shea. The Minister's clarification is consistent with what the White Paper in parts implied. I hope that the Government will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
consider incorporating it into the Bill by agreeing to the relevant amendment. I do not propose to press the amendment, but it would helpful for the matter to be elaborated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall, however, seek to press amendment No. 232 to a vote. The Committee has heard the exchanges. I believe, as does the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), that it is important for Parliament to take control of the list of exempted and disqualified categories. I hope that Labour Members will agree. The list should not be left to a Secretary of State, however well intentioned he or she may be. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment because of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will be positive towards the amendments. They are simple, and they seek to extend the clause to ensure that the people it defines are prevented from being elected as mayor or as members of the assembly. Currently, disqualification applies to people who have been convicted of an offence in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man and who have served a term of imprisonment because of it. The provisions should be extended to include offences committed elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite rightly, legislation has recently been passed in this country to ensure that there can be trials and convictions of people who have committed offences elsewhere—I am thinking primarily of child abuse offences in eastern Europe and the far east. The Bill contains a loophole whereby a person who has served a sentence of imprisonment for an offence in this country will be disqualified, but if that person has committed an identical offence in France or Belgium, or further afield, he will not be disqualified. That is unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, and have sympathy with it. However, does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the way in which it is worded might imply that someone who has been convicted of an offence in a country that has a doubtful regime—that is, a person who we would not regard as a criminal but who has been justly imprisoned—would be ineligible to stand for the assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, and I would be happy for us to seek agreement about it at a later stage of the Committee's proceedings. I am trying to flag up an apparent loophole. However, I should not like improper trials and convictions, which often take place abroad, to be included in the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, the amendment is personally relevant to me. Soon after I was first elected, an election took place in Southwark. We discovered, after the close of nominations and the withdrawal date for nominations, that one of our candidates had committed an offence that rendered him ineligible for election to the local authority. We never mentioned his name again in our literature—we referred only to two candidates in a three-person ward. Nevertheless, much to our embarrassment, that person was elected. The mayor had to shake his hand knowing, as we all did, that he would not be able to take his seat. When he went to the first group meeting, he was told by the chair that he would not be able to continue because
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
he was legally ineligible. All Liberals in Southwark remember his rejoinder: "I thought you believed in proportional representation here, and there are lots of us in Southwark who have been inside." I do not argue that he should have been able to stand, but I do not believe that people who have committed similar offences abroad should be eligible to stand either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that further consideration of the drafting may be possible, but, will the Minister respond positively to the purpose and import of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of our previous Chairmen said that he was overwhelmed by the amount of welcome that had been heaped on his head. I would not wish to create such a response in you, Mr. O'Hara, but it is a privilege to be serving again under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened intently to the points raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. However, I am not convinced by his argument that there should be, exclusively for GLA elections, even further conditions imposed upon candidates. The provisions in clause 20(1)(d) simply replicate the provisions that are applied to local authorities by section 80(1)(d) of the Local Government Act 1972. I can see no reason why the GLA should be treated differently, in that respect, from the London borough councils. I thought that the point made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) was especially pertinent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey neglected precisely to define what he means by "elsewhere". It would be grossly unfair if a prospective candidate were to be burdened by a legal system under which a foreigner could have been mistreated for purely political reasons or through a miscarriage of justice. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to change our perception of the matter, he will have to define what he means by "elsewhere". Furthermore, the amendment would require unanimity among the many varied legal systems throughout the world. On those grounds alone, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I understand that one must have consistent legislation, and I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seeking to make some progress on this issue and reach agreement on it. Will the Minister for Transport in London or the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department at least tell the Committee whether the issue could be referred to the Home Office for consideration? The Minister for Transport in London indicated the other day that a ministerial colleague in the Home Office responsible for electoral matters, who is not on the Committee, was looking at a range of revisions for the system. If the hon. Lady or her hon. Friend could tell me that the matter will be taken and fed into the system, to avoid people who have committed a gross offence elsewhere being eligible to stand, I should be happy not to take the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

electoral arrangements. No one could accept an amendment of the kind currently drafted by Liberal Democrat Members. It would, 	<i>prima facie,</i> exclude people such as refugees from the Nazis who had come a cropper under that regime, Soviet dissidents, or prisoners of conscience in all parts of the world. I think that the Government are correct in this matter at any rate, if not in much else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that it would not be appropriate for the Home Office to examine this amendment or, indeed, the thrust of what the hon. Gentleman is attempting to clarify, for reasons that I have already given. First, the hon. Gentleman has not defined what he means by "elsewhere". Secondly, we do not live in a world where every legal system is exactly the same. There are cases of gross miscarriages of justice under other systems and of me power of me state being used against people who have been deemed criminal for actions that have nothing to do with anything other than their political or religious believes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to mislead the Committee by saying that the Government will reflect further on me issue. Again, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the arguments made by both the Minister and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about regimes elsewhere. The word "elsewhere" was intended to have its normal definition, to mean outside the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there are wider considerations. It would be wrong for me to ask me Minister for Transport in London to make a commitment when it would need discussion with her ministerial colleagues in another Department. I can pursue that that matter with them, and it may come within the subject of electoral reform in general.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly express the hope that any clause that retains powers and prerogatives for the Secretary of State that could be subject to abuse or misapplication is fully criticised, exposed, argued against and, if my right hon. and hon. Friends agree, voted against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the clause wholly deficient, for me reasons that were set out in me debate on amendments Nos. 233, 232 and 144. Those amendments were not incorporated, and I still regard clause 20(1)(b) as according to the Secretary of State powers that could be subject to abuse. Therefore, I hope that the clause will not be accepted; I shall be shouting against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be equally brief. Liberal Democrat Members have me same concern. We have just dealt with the second group of amendments on the selection list; we were not happy with the outcome on the first group of amendments, except for the assurance about the dual mandate, which was helpful. My one reflection on that is that the Government seem to be of the view that the electorate should be allowed to decide whether someone who is a councillor, for example, would be an appropriate member of the GLA. One could reasonably use the same argument about whether someone aged 19 or 20 should be able to be chosen as a member of the GLA. The Government's argument, both last week and this, is inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, Liberal Democrat Members are very unhappy about the Bill's repeated but unnecessary references to the Secretary of State's powers. We have offered the Government a way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we are not happy with the clause. If it is pushed to a vote, we shall vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: it has already been made clear to the Committee that clause 20 provides for candidates being disqualified from being elected to the posts of mayor or assembly member. It is based on part V of the Local Government Act 1972, which applies to local authority membership. The clause also applies to the selection of a person to fill a vacancy among the London candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 further provides for the Secretary of State to designate by order offices or appointments that disqualify a person from being mayor or an assembly member. It does not relate to local authorities, but it is similar to provisions made in respect of the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament. It might be used, for example, to designate certain public appointments, the holder of which would be disqualified from standing for mayor or assembly member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments that have been partly restated by the hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey were put to the Committee in respect of the previous group of amendments. My hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction covered all the points that were made, and the Committee's verdict was that the amendments should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol></p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important new clause, and I hope to persuade the Committee to support it. It is simply drafted, and would allow the people of London, or an overwhelming
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
majority of the members of the London assembly, to decide that the mayor had gone so far beyond what was generally regarded as acceptable that the wider electorate should have an opportunity to decide whether the mayor should continue in office. The Bill as drafted contains no such provision. Specifically, under the new clause a mechanism would be triggered whereby if 90 per cent. or more of the assembly—23 out of the 25 members—or 10 per cent. of those entitled to vote in a London election decided that they wanted a re-election, a re-election would be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not an idea dreamt up by me and my colleagues over a pint on a cold London night; there is good constitutional precedent for it in a large number of places which have directly elected mayors. There is not just constitutional precedent but regular usage of that power, for very good reason. For example, let us imagine that a mayor became as ill as President Yeltsin appears to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), using the hotline to the Kremlin which I had always suspected that he had, has information that has not been shared with us to the effect that President Yeltsin is better. We will look to the hon. Gentleman for regular updates on the matter in London Labour briefings in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the example is serious. If someone were as ill as President Yeltsin has been—even if he is better today—or may be in the future, it would probably be inappropriate for him or her to be responsible for running a city such as London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent times, mayors in the United State have ended up in prison, under what I hope that the Minister for Transport in London would regard as an acceptable legal regime, for criminal activities that I also hope she would regard as deserving imprisonment. The mayor of Washington is the most famous recent example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was re-elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed he was. The provision does not mean that the electorate cannot decide that they want a mayor who is in prison; it means that they are allowed to question whether a mayor who has been imprisoned, perhaps after conviction for one or more serious offences, should continue in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone may, through no fault of his own become seriously mentally or physically ill, but not able to decide to stand down. Would it really be good for London for someone who had been committed as mentally ill, for example, and was in a long-term institution, to remain as mayor? The responsibilities that the Government will give to the Greater London authority rest largely with the mayor, not with the assembly. Would it be appropriate for such a person to remain in office for up to three and half years, without the electorate having any power to remove him? My colleagues and I believe that it would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have decided that most of the power of the Greater London authority will reside in the mayor. Not to provide for any means of getting rid of the mayor appears—to put it simply—bananas. It is not sensible to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
give so much power to one person and no power to anyone else to do anything about it. It is not like, for example, the period under a recent Tory Administration, when the last but one Conservative Prime Minister was prevailed on in various ways by her colleagues to withdraw. That happened because she was dependent on her parliamentary colleagues for her position as Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) has argued, as we often have, that the mayor should come from the assembly and be accountable to the assembly, if the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition were to lose the confidence of their parliamentary colleagues, they would go, but under the Greater London authority there is no such power. A mayor could lose the confidence of all his or her ruling group—or the group of the same colour—on the assembly but he or she could stay on. We therefore dunk that mis timely and appropriate power of recall ought to be in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many precedents around the world for giving voters the power, when things go wrong, to sack local bosses whom they have elected. My colleagues and I have heard no argument as to why Londoners should not have those same powers. To put it succinctly, no one can legislate to stop a mayor going off the rails, but we can—and we must—legislate to stop a runaway mayor driving our capital city off the rails, too. I should like to give me Committee a couple of examples of where that happens at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be pre-empting the hon. Gentleman, but is he going to give us details about how the
	<br><q><p>"10 per cent. or more of those entitled to vote"</p></q>
submitting a petition would work? Would he rely on an informal mechanism of people collecting signatures, which would no doubt include the usual Mickey Mouse and Napoleon Bonaparte? If so, how would he verify me procedure and how much would it cost? If, on the other hand, he envisages a more formal mechanism, how would it be triggered? In other words, how would someone initiate the potentially very costly process of gathering a verifiable 10 per cent. of the electorate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asked a perfectly proper question to which there is, I hope, an entirely appropriate answer. We cannot have a Mickey Mouse system; it must be set down. I am happy to make a copy of the rules for the city of St. Louis, for example, for the right hon. Gentleman. He is a great lover of the United States, which is appropriate, given the variety of that country and the democratic education that it can give us. I have here the articles in the St. Louis city charter which set out exactly how a petition can be called and how the names are to be verified. It is done using an electoral returning officer process. All the procedures are clear, and the declaration as to whether sufficient numbers of people are registered and have been confirmed to be appropriate petitioners is agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the process is the same for all the other major cities of the United States. Washington D.C. uses the same system. I have a copy of its arrangements, which take up only four pages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
I have a further copy of the arrangements for a smaller town, Waterville in Maine, where the procedure has recently been used. I had not heard of it, the town, although I am told that it is famous as the place from which Edmund Muskie came and where George Mitchell was born. According to the 	<i>Boston Globe,</i> it is also a town where
	<br><q><p>"local politicians occasionally behave less than statesmanlike. Since 1980, Waterville has seen three of its mayors convicted of drunken driving, disorderly conduct, and felony embezzlement",</p></q>
so the town uses me system relatively often and feel that it is useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Importantly, I also have a three-page copy of the rules that have been and contrive to be used in San Francisco, a large American city where me power of recall exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to receiving the detailed information that the hon. Gentleman offered. As he rightly said, I am an admirer of the United States and of much, if not all, of what goes on there. Nevertheless, I am curious because the great cities that the hon. Gentleman mentioned are nothing in size compared with Greater London. The cost element therefore surely arises. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell us how much the power of recall costs the Americans so that we can extrapolate from his figures to get an idea of the scale of costs here. More, importantly, will he tell us whether there is a mechanism to prevent vexatious repetition of the process, which could end up being extremely costly for the people of London? We should at least be aware of that before we vote on the hon. Gentleman's suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several questions arise from what the right hon. Gentleman said. One is, "What is me cost?" First, the recall could be triggered by a vote of 90 per cent. of the members of the assembly, which would cost nothing. That would trigger an election, and the usual costs of a London-wide election would be incurred. The Minister gave us a rough estimate of the cost, and I defer to him in terms of accuracy. Of course, a cost would be involved. One could, however, argue that it would be less than that which resulted from a corrupt mayor abusing his power and doing entirely inappropriate things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The electorate would have to take the cost account. If there were a process that triggered a new mayor's election to the assembly, mere would be a great debate in London about whether we wanted the costs of a further election. Clearly, it would be a three-stage process. The assembly or the people would trigger it. There would then be a referendum on whether the existing mayor should go. If that succeeded, mere would be an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, mere would of course be a cost for properly administered petition gathering. I do not have a figure for London because we have not had a UK experience and I have not transposed the cost from an American city. I should, however, tell the right hon. Gentleman that although some of the American cities concerned are not as big as Greater London, they are large metropolitan conurbations—St. Louis and San Francisco are hardly small cities. Waterville, Maine is not a great conurbation, but some of the other cities are. I accept that there is a cost issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have noticed that the new clause that the friends of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) tabled suggest that a petition would require one fifth of Londoners to sign. The costs of verifying such a petition would be larger man those of me recall petition that we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will want to argue his alternative, which is a perfectly proper one to put on the table. It will, however, also have a cost implication if it triggers a process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two final points. First, all the examples that I have found have a 10 or a 20 per cent. trigger in terms of me electorate. My hon. Friends and I have suggested a 10 per cent. trigger. The 10 per cent. would not force me mayor out of office; it would trigger the referendum that would force him out of office if a majority of those voting wanted that. Ten per cent. of a city as large as London would be 600,000 people. That is not an insignificant number when one has properly to attest and verify that those concerned are adults who may vote and who are on the electoral register and that they are not Mickey Mouses, Benjamin Disraelis or whoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have included me alternative of a large majority of the assembly voting for recall—this is the debate between the right hon. Gentleman and us, at least on paper— because we need unanimity. Let us take one example and depoliticise it a bit. Let us imagine that, next year in London, we elected a mayor who was a member of the Green party, as happened only a couple of years ago in Rome. Let us imagine that there was only one Green party member in the assembly. It would therefore be possible for a coalition to trigger, if it were so minded, the removal of the mayor. If one asked for 100 per cent. agreement among the assembly, every member would need to be involved. I accept that if the mayor was from a minority party, or was an independent, a figure of 90 per cent. would allow a coalition of his political opponents to trigger the process. They would not enter into that lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a moment, my hon. Friend the member for Kingston and Surbiton will speak to the other new clause that we have tabled. That deals with the way in which the assembly, if it were to choose to exercise the power that we are discussing, would need to work out the implications for itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman, in the course of his research, found reference to any American town or city that invokes its council men or board of councils— whether by 90 per cent., 35 per cent. or any other percentage—to go down the road of getting rid of its mayor without a recall petition? I doubt that he would be able to find such a place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, does he accept that the absolute norm for recall petitions in me United State of America is 25 per cent? California is exceptional in using the low proportion of 10 per cent. British Columbia, the only state or province of Canada in which the process is followed, uses 40 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know about the last of the hon. Gentleman's facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
I have not asked the American embassy to give me a comprehensive survey, but I understand that the figures vary. In the United States, the percentage can be as high as 25 per cent. or 20 per cent. Some of the larger cities use 10 per cent. St. Louis, for example, has a process whereby three quarters of the board of aldermen must vote to remove, followed by a well-publicised public hearing— like an impeachment hearing—during which the mayor may call defence witnesses. That is followed by another vote by assembly members. The rules list categories of reasons that can trigger removal. The mayor can be removed for
	<br><q><p>"crime or misdemeanour in office, for grave misconduct showing unfitness for public duty, or for permanent disability".</p></q>
I am not saying that that way must be our way, or that it is the only way. The Committee, or one of the Houses of Parliament, could take the view that a 20 per cent. trigger, or even one of 40 per cent. would be preferable. Liberal Democrat Members believe that there should be a trigger, and that it would be better to have a trigger at a higher level than to have no trigger at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we are giving the Committee the opportunity to consider an important power that is normally found in other places with directly elected mayors. This is the first time that there will be a directly elected mayor in the United Kingdom. As the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) hinted, he or she will not just be any directly elected mayor, but the mayor for our largest conurbation. We believe that the Committee should consider the issue, and agree to a way forward that facilitates the provision of a power of recall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the substance and the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's comments. He rightly pointed out that my modest contribution to the debate comes from the same stable. That is because the Bill proposes a radical new constitutional arrangement for the governance of our capital city. Serious thought must be given to what we are doing, why we are doing it and where we are going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The radical break, in this respect, is that leaders, at local and national levels, have always emerged from, and been accountable to, their peers. Council leaders come from the ranks of council members and Prime Ministers from Members of Parliament. We understand that process, and are familiar with it. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to the tragic demise of Lady Thatcher, which many of us still find shocking and regrettable. Nevertheless, it happened The hon. Member for Brent, East who I hope will contribute to the debate, may well give us inside information on certain events that occurred soon after the election of the GLC, of which he was such a distinguished member. It is yet another rather distant example, but appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are well used to mechanisms of accountability, whereby leaders are accountable to, and removable by, their peer group—the other elected representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The men in grey suits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Men in whatever colour suits. As I look round the room, I see that there are not too many grey suits. The hon. Member for Ealing, North is not wearing one; perhaps he is making a political statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
For the first time, there exists the possibility of electing a chief executive in his or her own right, separately and independently. Do we want to have a mechanism of accountability and removal during that person's term of office? I am with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in his contention that as a safety mechanism, a reassurance to the people of London, especially in the early, experimental phase of this radical constitutional departure, we should provide them with a mechanism whereby a chief executive, elected in his or her own right, could be removed if, as I suggest in new clause 9,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"the actions of the Mayor are deemed to be harmful to the interests of the people of London."</p></q>
In using that wording, I confess that I contemplated using terms such as "high crimes and misdemeanours". However, I thought that that might be tempting fate. I also wanted to distance this argument from personality or personal behaviour. One of the difficulties that Americans have got themselves into is trying to distinguish in their minds—and, indeed, in their impeachment mechanism—between me personal aspects and the constitutional or administrative aspects of their president's behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it would be useful to try to identify the grounds on which removal would be contemplated and legitimate. I deliberately drafted my new clause broadly to explore that opportunity. We must ensure that such a removal would be made not on the basis of personal proclivities or behaviour, but on the judgment of what the elected mayor is or is not doing for the people of London. That would be the criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the important issue, on which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke at some length, of the mechanism for removal. Although I yield to few in my admiration of the United States, I am not always prepared slavishly to copy what goes on there. If we did, I would look to the excellent practice in many of the smaller states where the state legislatures meet only briefly, and once every two years. That would do the people an enormous favour. I wish that I had had the foresight to table amendments that would constrict the meetings of the Greater London assembly to six weeks once every two years. That would be the biggest favour we could do the people of London. I fear that the proposed mechanism will get seriously out of hand, but that is another debate for another day. Indeed, that has given me a rather good thought to which I will perhaps return on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the right hon. Gentleman's point about not wanting legislatures to meet very often, when he seems to want this Committee to sit the whole time. Can he explain that inconsistency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I would be perfectly content if this Parliament were to meet very rarely and therefore had very few opportunities to legislate. Unfortunately, as the Government have initiated a legislative process, I am interested in scrutinising it and slowing it down as far as possible. I think that I am reasonably consistent in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
My fear is that the more assemblies we create, the more possibilities will exist for excessive legislation. The people of Scotland will learn that to their cost, I believe, and I fear that the people of London may do the same. However, in comparing the mechanisms proposed in my new clause and in that of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, we are examining the feasibility and workability of various approaches to holding the mayor to account. I am uneasy about the approach of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which is derived from the practice of the United States. I can see the likelihood that the mechanism could be very expensive, especially where it requires a petition to be signed by 10 per cent. of people entitled to vote and so on. It was interesting that the hon. Gentleman was unable even to estimate the cost of the process. I am sure that it was an oversight, but he also did not answer my question about vexatious or repetitious resort to the mechanism, which could be extremely expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My approach is more simple and much less expensive. I believe that assembly members should have some role and some locus in the process, to enable them to decide whether the mayor has taken actions that are, in the words of my proposed new clause,
	<br><q><p>"harmful to the interests of the people of London."</p></q>
They would be able to decide whether a process should be initiated to decide upon removal of the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have proposed two thresholds. The initial resolution should have the support of at least nine assembly members. I have specified that deliberately, to try to remove any vexatious elements such as a small minority of members who wish to harass the mayor. I have suggested that the high threshold of approximately two thirds of the membership be required to pass the motion in favour of removal. If assembly members were to agree to such a motion, they would have to be aware that they would be held to account if they were acting frivolously or in a manner that was not fully justifiable. They would be held to account at the next election if they were to involve the people of London in a gratuitous or unnecessary re-run of the mayoral election and in all the expense that goes with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That series of hurdles and accountability is built into the proposed mechanism. Such a mechanism is very necessary. I hope that the Government and Ministers will think long and hard about the proposed new clause before they impose or inflict on the people of London even the remote possibility of a mayor becoming a danger or a liability, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bemondsey suggested reasons why that might occur, such as mental incapacity. It could occur for many other reasons and be worse in ways that we can scarcely dare to contemplate. The fact is that the possibility exists. The Committee is considering how best to provide a mechanism to ensure in-term accountability of a directly elected mayor, over and above what has been contemplated until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is the important thing, and I do not wish to get too bogged down in the exact mechanism. I am uneasy about the petition approach, and I do not want to

fall out with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bemondsey about thresholds in the assembly. I am sure that something can be worked out along the lines that I have suggested. The figure of 90 per cent. is perhaps too high, and may well be unachievable, but I recognise the point that the hon. Gentleman made about that. I shall not stand absolutely on the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 9 involves no collusion. I can rarely be accused of colluding with the Liberal Democrats, and I am rarely accused of colluding even with my own Front Bench. It is instructive that the great minds of the hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench and myself have independently concluded that something must be done. If the Government were to agree in principle, we could reach a broad agreement on the mechanisms. Surely, at this early experimental stage of a radical departure in governance, such a mechanism is the least that we should provide to give assurance to the electorate of our great capital city of London. They must be assured that there is not the slightest risk that they could inadvertently inflict on themselves a mayor who could do great damage to the city. We must avoid that, which is why the new clauses are so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 7 proposes that the mayor resign if one fifth of the London electorate or 1 million voters sigh up to a recall petition. The Committee has the luxury of having on offer all three possible options for recalling the mayor. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst ably proposed an assembly-only option. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bemondsey moved the assembly and referendum option, and I am moving the referendum-only option. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made the important point that whichever route we go down, there must be a mechanism for recalling the mayor if the circumstances so demand. It is the principle that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the leader of a local authority runs amok, his own group will remove him. Here in the House of Commons, if for any reason the Prime Minister should lose the confidence of the House, because his party enjoys a majority in the House of Commons—the definition of the Prime Minister is the man who can command a majority in the House of Commons—the Prime Minister can be removed. It does not matter what are the rules of each individual party—if the Prime Minister's party wants to remove him, it can. Wherever we have a democratic organisation under the present structure, in which the Executive and the Legislature are merged, that state of affairs exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a new form of government. It is a unique form of government, a pilot scheme for this country—and one heck of a pilot scheme at that. Here we have a clearly defined separation of powers between the executive and the legislature. The mayor is not dependent on the assembly for his authority. If the assembly votes against him on day one, that is irrelevant and meaningless; the mayor can ignore the wishes of the assembly. The mayor had his own mandate; he can campaign on his own manifesto and programme. If that were what actually happened, that would be fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that somehow schedule 5 is misleading? It says clearly that the mayor must accept a budget suitably amended by the assembly. The assembly has controls over the budget, which I would have thought to be crucial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. Let us suppose that the assembly decides what the budget is to be. Will the mayor have to resign? No, he will not; he will remain. There is absolutely nothing that the assembly can do to remove the mayor. That is the important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rightly, the Government have included controls over the budget in the Bill, because the budget is the be all and end all. What if the mayor takes leave of his senses? What if he does as the Liberal Democrats did in the Isle of Wight when they said that they wanted their own currency? What if the mayor calls for London to become a republic and claims independence? What if he loses touch with reality? Those are not stupid questions; the example of the Isle of Wight is genuine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the premier capital city of the world, and we do not want it to be made a laughing stock by a mayor who loses touch with reality. We need a mechanism to restrain the mayor if sufficient people think that he should be restrained. Our new clause does not call for the mayor to be sacked; it calls for him to resign. He can submit himself for re-election; if he gets a mandate, so be it. However, there must be a clear limit to his powers. As the hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, such a procedure is in common use in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate that the Minister for London and Construction will deploy the issue of cost in his defence against the new clauses. Substantial cost may indeed be involved. For example, checking a recall petition of a million voters will be a long and complex procedure. But what is more important: that the mayor of London has taken leave of his senses or that the Government are not prepared to fund the true cost of democracy? Any democratic process must contain checks and balances. We have a balance on the budget, but nowhere else; we need such a balance. All three new clauses provide different scenarios, but their fundamental principle is that the power of the mayor can be checked if it is appropriate to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Livingstone 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share many of the concerns that we have heard. The issue was largely my initial objection to the creation of the post of mayor. We will create a single powerful figure in a way that is completely alien to all the normal practices of British politics. Under those practices, if a leader—whether a Prime Minister or a council leader—loses the confidence of his or her colleagues, he or she can be removed. My worry has always been that we will create a post into which someone can be locked for four years, with very few checks and balances. Initially, assembly members were not even going to be paid a salary, but that has been rectified so that there will be a more impressive assembly to hold the mayor in check.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if the mayor goes bad, in a variety of ways? What if Londoners, having elected a mayor, found out a few months later that there were some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
extremely dubious practices in his or her background, but that the legal process might take several years? What would have happened if Lady Porter had been elected mayor of London a few months before all the shenanigans in Westminster and me £27 million that was misappropriated to help the Tories get re-elected came to light? With her money, Lady Porter has already been able to protract the case for more than a decade. She could have served me entire term. There would be no mechanism to remove someone like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not the slightest doubt that, given the structure of votes on this Committee, the new clauses will be defeated, but we are discussing a fundamental weakness in the Bill. I assume that it will receive a lot of attention in another place and that it might come back altered to reflect these concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the size of London, there are particular problems with a referendum for a recall. It would be easier to hold such a referendum in a smaller area. The process is not frequently used. I am aware of only one removal in recent years of a large governmental figure in America—me governor of the state of Utah or Nevada, but then he had gone completely mad and become openly racist and anti-semitic. Those views became apparent only after me election. Most of the instances that we are talking about are quite small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more realistic and speedier option for checking the mayor would be to have a fixed proportion of assembly members able to remove him or her; but when I argue about that with my colleagues, they point to what is going on in Washington at the moment, where, on a purely partisan basis, the concept of high crimes and misdemeanours has been reduced to the level of fellatio. It is absolute nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the partisan nature of our politics, it would be easy to assemble perhaps a two-thirds majority, particularly if there were one or two disgruntled people whom the mayor had upset by not putting them on the foreign travel circuit or something. Perhaps we should consider requiring a two-thirds majority amongst the two main parties, so that there would be a much more bipartisan approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although my attempt may not have been ideal, an effort should at least be made to include a criterion for removal, which might remove the personal elements that have bedevilled the impeachment process in the United States? The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggested a threshold of 90 per cent; but, as has often been said in Committee, it is likely that no party will command even a simple majority in the assembly that we all envisage. If, however, a threshold is set of even two thirds, a number of parties would have to club together even to get near it, which would provide a safeguard against the situation that worries the hon. Member for Brent, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livingstone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no suggestion before us that completely encompasses the issue. That is why I assume that something might appear at a later stage. We must find an answer.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
Reference was made to the removal of Andrew McIntosh from the Greater London Council. That is a classic example of how our party system works to its best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): He did not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livingstone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He wouldn't would he?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a party leader has lost me confidence of his Chief Whip, of his deputy leader and me majority of the members of his shadow Cabinet, it is not likely that he will survive for long. That is me simple reality. I do not think that the McIntosh incident came as a surprise, given that the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> headlined it day after day throughout the campaign. The only person who seemed to be surprised was Andrew McIntosh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlignton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to recount the history of Andrew McIntosh—I shall save it for my memoirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument against introducing a mechanism that is solely dependent upon me assembly or on party caucuses is made on the grounds that the mayor's authority is an executive authority derived from the people. The authority of the assembly is one of scrutiny, and is also derived from the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way of overcoming that argument would be to provide that if, for example, a two-thirds majority of the assembly wishes to exercise a recall power, the power should go back to the people. In other words, the assembly and mayor should both go back to the people for re-election, to decide whether a mandate for both is renewed. That would overcome the argument that the people's role is undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livingstone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is pointing towards the best way out of the dilemma, by suggesting that a resolution to remove the mayor should trigger an election for everybody. That would concentrate the mind against frivolous nonsense. I doubt whether members of me House of Representatives who have been voting for impeachment would be quite so keen if they had thought that they were about to trigger an election in four or five weeks' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on another strong reason why such a proposal might be the way forward? If me decision were left, as he suggests, to the majority of the two major parties or whatever else, there would always be a danger that an independent mayor, a Green party mayor or a mayor who was not from a major party could regularly be threatened by the larger parties saying that they are about to trigger the process. That, too, would be unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livingstone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loath to get into too many hypothetical examples. It is highly unlikely that an independent candidate would be elected to the post of mayor, although I understand that the Labour party machine has commissioned an opinion poll to examine the possibility. Why that should be the case, I have not a clue, but there we are.

It should also be borne in mind when discussing recall petitions that the old Labour GLC managed to get more than 1 million signatures on a petition against its abolition. That was a vast undertaking, the organisation of which cost the GLC a considerable amount of money. Many staff were occupied with the petition, as were a huge number of supporters across London. It still took months, however, and such an undertaking is not easy in a city of this size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather inconclusive about the matter. I do not like voting against my party; I think that I am working my way towards a fighting abstention. I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, for not welcoming you to the Committee, but I am always so disturbed when I find myself at odds with my party that it is hard to focus my thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My welcome to you, Mr. O'Hara, is truncated but none the less warm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, two aspects of the new clauses have been debated. One aspect is the principle, which all of the new clauses share, that the Bill should contain some power to check the executive and to enable the dismissal of the mayor. That is surely the ultimate exercise in accountability, and should be contained in the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mentioned the need for such provision in case the mayor is ill. Other examples have been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle has been well expressed, and reflects historic conventions in this place and elsewhere in British politics, whereby votes of no confidence in councils and in Parliament have been the trigger for holding the executive to account. Votes of no confidence in the council chamber, on the Floor of the House of Commons and in party caucuses have been the way in which we have traditionally held leaders and executives to account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new form of government introduced by the Bill needs a different kind of system. That is why the Government should consider the various options before them and choose one. As the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, there are three families of option—forms of recall, votes of no confidence and impeachment proceedings. Various factors should be weighted in the balance when choosing between those three options. One is how they link back to the electorate. I share the view of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell) that any trigger for holding the executive to account should have a direct link back to the voters of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the issue of cost, which the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst mentioned. The process needs to be efficient, partly because we want to ensure that the threat to the executive is a real one, and likely to be triggered if needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor to be borne in mind when making a choice is whether the option will be workable in terms of the relationship between the mayor and the assembly. Would it allow the normal workings of the assembly and the mayor—the budget process and debates on the mayor's strategies and policies—to take place without gridlock? My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to that point. Would it ensure that there was no partisanship, so that party politics would not get in the way of effective government? That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
is a problem that I envisage with the impeachment option under the new clause tabled by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. As we have seen in the United States, it is possible for partisan politics to come into play during an impeachment process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interject a note of caution? Surely the whole point of party is that it can effectively focus attention on abuses where they occur. Per se, there is nothing wrong with partisanship—it needs to be judged on its merits. Therefore, there is a role for parties acting together in the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks but, as we have seen in the United States, partisanship can be taken too far. I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on the authors of the federalist papers when they set up the constitution, and the impeachment process within it. The papers clearly state that the impeachment process was designed to try to prevent partisanship; but the intentions of the authors of the federalist papers are being overridden, as we can see from current events. Partisanship has become powerful, so potent a force, possibly because politics today are geared by the media.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be concerned about the abuse of partisanship. That is why Liberal Democrat members are worried about a process that relies only on the members of the assembly, even given a qualified majority system. New clause 2 tries to get around that problem by ensuring that if members of the assembly voted by a qualified majority to remove me mayor, they would have to face the consequences of that vote and go back to the electorate. Such a system is in place in another capital city. The major metropolitan authority in Tokyo, whose population is similar to London's, operates that system. I am grateful to the Japanese local government centre, which faxed me with regard to the operation of votes of no confidence and council dissolution in Tokyo. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is in Japanese, but I have translated it for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process is simple. If a governor or mayor cannot reach a compromise with the council on an issue sharply dividing them, the council can declare a vote of no confidence. To do so, a two-thirds quorum is needed, and at least three quarters of those present must support the motion. Once that is agreed, as a counter measure, the governor or mayor is entitled to dissolve the council and call for a local election to resolve the matter. If mere is no dissolution order within 10 days of the vote of no confidence, the governor or mayor must resign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That process ensures that a vote of no confidence is not used frivolously, but only for serious purposes. It ensures that there is a tie back to the electorate because the assembly has to face re-election. Such a system strikes a balance between the factors that I outlined. It ensures that there is effective government and a link to the electorate and that costs are kept to a minimum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman relied on the Tokyo example and said that a three-quarters quorum must be present and that a proportion of it must vote in favour. That must result in a much lower figure than the 90 per cent. for which his colleague, the hon. Member for

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which I support, is one of two options whose merits we need to debate. My hon. Friend's new clause is linked to a recall petition.

I urge Labour Members to think about how well the city of Tokyo is run, about its transport systems and about how clean it is.

The options for holding the mayor to account that are before the Committee range from an extreme version of recall, whereby a hugh number of petitions would be needed to trigger the recall, to the milder form proposed by Liberal Democrat Members—a no confidence vote, followed by the re-election of the assembly—to another extreme, the impeachment process. My hon. Friends and I considered all these options before we tabled our new clauses, which contain reasonable proposals that are in line with the British political system. New clause 2, in its link with the vote of no confidence, echoes a recognisable feature of our system. The options in our new clauses have more merit than the other two options that have been proposed.

I am concerned that the Government have failed to produce their own option for holding the mayor to account. I wonder whether that relates to other aspects of the Bill. Clause 27(10(b), for example, refers to the Secretary of State's power to overturn anything that the mayor or the assembly wishes to do. Apparently, the Government want to prevent the mayor and the assembly from taking measures that would be disliked by the people of London by giving that power to the Secretary of State. That is not democratic—it does not give the people of London the final say. Unfortunately, that is typical of the Government's approach. They do not want to increase democracy in London by giving Londoners the power to hold the mayor to account. I hope that Labour members, having heard all the arguments, will reflect on that. The Bill should build in procedures for the proper accountability of the Executive. I hope that Labour members of the Committee will have the courage of their convictions and vote for better accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The figures in the new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst approximate almost exactly to the figure that is currently required in the United States Senate for the removal of the President of the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell on that coincidence, although I remark in passing that the charge of perjury, which the President faces, removed the only two Privy Councillors who have had to resign their Privy Council offices since the second world war—namely Jack Profumo, for a statement that he made to the House of Commons, and my constituent Jonathan Aitken. Perjury is, therefore, a serious charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may have forgotten that the option of impeachment still exists in this country. It was last taken up in the early years of the previous century. I shall not test your patience by going into immense detail, Mr. O'Hara. The motion was put down against Melville, who was in Pitt's Cabinet. The vote resulted in a dead heat. The Speaker of the day argued, using a certain interpretation of the convention, that the motion was the original proposition, and that the Government amendment to the impeachment motion followed on from that. The Speaker therefore voted for Melville's impeachment, and that later took place in the House of Lords. In fact, in the fullness of time, he was acquitted.

I remark absolutely in passing that the Prime Minister of the day, Pitt, was led from the Chamber in tears. There are widespread grounds for thinking that the impeachment hastened his death, which occurred at the beginning of 1806. I include that detail because it tells the Committee that were a mayor to be removed from office in London, me Prime Minister of me day might find his demise hastened by that event. We can dunk of particular mayors who might cause that. We wish no human being ill, including me present Prime Minister, so that consideration must remain at the back of our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of impeachment is totally properly rooted in our constitution. There was a passing reference to illness earlier. The hon. Member for Harrow, East made an extremely well informed intervention about practice in the United States and referred to the health of President Yeltsin. I remind the whole Committee of the legendary lines penned by the men poet laureate about King Edward VII on his deathbed:
	<br><q><p>"Across the wires the electric message came: 'He is no better, he is much the same.'"</p></q>
Mr. Alfred Austin was also responsible for lines concerning Mafeking. I must say in a low voice that the Minister for Transport in London was surprised that I had not introduced Mafeking into a recent debate. I therefore also offer me Committee the following couplet about Mafeking:
	<br><q><p>'They did not know what blench meant, They stayed in their entrenchment".</p></q>
That is so bad a couplet that I am entirely careless whether it is applied to the Government or the Opposition members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible to include in the Bill a provision along the lines of the new clause proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, or of the new clauses proposed by other members of me Committee. The novelty of the office should prompt action on our part.

We all know the stories of Tammany Hall; we all know the stories of Boss Prendergast of Kansas City. You would rule me out of order, Mr. O'Hara, if I dwelt on that other Irish-American city boss who, on returning to Dublin and building the present British residence in Dublin, which the Government are seeking to sell, was involved in a bizarre story involving the burial of his Cherokee princess wife and his favourite racehorse—a story worthy of the late constituent of the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), Mr. Sherlock Holmes. However, I will not dwell on that, except to say that municipal potentates are capable of eccentric behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that both the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked why the Government did not have a proposal. Our proposal for a balance between the assembly and the mayor is the Bill and all the checks and balances therein.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is not enough, which is an entirely reasonable point. However, I have to say that apart from fatuous incantations of a mantra—that there should be a referendum for a recall because there should be—the case has not been well made by either Opposition Members or the odd dissenting Labour Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People go wrong when they invoke the notion of what exists thus far in Britain. The post of mayor is an individual, elected, executive post. It is not akin to that of Prime Minister, nor to that of me leader of a party or a faction within an executive or legislature. It is a separate, distinct and individual position. Therefore, whether it is McIntosh versus Livingstone or Thatcher versus the many grey suits or white coats, the examples are not germane to the particular configuration of governance that is before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. O'Hara, for foolishly trying to do your job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone mentioned apples and oranges earlier, which is entirely the point: the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is trying to compare apples and oranges. We are not talking about the titular or otherwise head of a faction in a group of elected people within an institution of governance, we are talking about separate, individual post which we contend is more than adequately accounted for in terms of checks and balances by clause 14, which prescribes that disqualification can occur under the Audit Commission Act 1998, as a result of a conviction under our criminal law, or for breaches of part II of the Representation of the People Act 1983. Further disqualifiers are the number of meetings me mayor can miss in the course of his or her term—a point that we discussed ad nauseam à la the number of angels who can dance on a pin head—and the budget restrictions in schedule 5, to which I have already alluded. Hon. Members pooh-poohed the latter as a minor point, but, in the end, the assembly can, by a two-thirds majority, amend and determine the consolidated budget with which the mayor will have to run. That is not a small point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the notion of fixed terms is just as much an element of accountability. From the way that some Opposition Members have been speaking, one would dunk that we will be electing mayors for life or at least for 15 or 20-year terms, rather man for four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the example cited my right hon.

If he elects to remain in office, will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that there is no way of removing him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In such a case—and also in the case of Shirley Porter, who was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East—the law must take its course. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman can even begin to persuade himself of the merit of his argument. Is he really saying that the people of London should have no say for me rest of a four-year term, no matter how off the rails me mayor goes, no matter whether he is locked up, awaiting trial, convicted, physically or mentally incapacitated, cannot do or does not want to do the job, or lives in the Bahamas? Is he really saying that it should not be possible to throw the mayor out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the best part of me past hour and a half, much of what the hon. Gentleman has said has been either famous or tortuous, and his last comment comes close to being both. Much of what he just said is covered by what I read out regarding the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the Representation of me People Act 1983. If a mayor is committed and incapacitated under law, he will no longer be able to pop along to six meetings int he period provided for in the relevant clause. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is trying to tell me that the mayor will get a day pass; perhaps he is saying that if the mayor is committed to the Royal Free under the relevant portions of the Mental Health Act 1983, he might get a dispensation to pop along to the monthly meetings of the Greater London assembly in some capacity or other. If the hon. Gentleman can show me the relevant section of the Act, which says that those elected to executive, London-wide positions, who go a bit doolally and are committed can get a dispensation to pop along to Greater London assembly meetings. I will happily concede the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to put a specific case to the hon. Gentleman. The current Prime Minister of Sri Lanka is a lady in her eighties. She is in a wheelchair and is brought to the meetings of Parliament. She remains in office by the grace of her daughter, who is the President. She plays no significant or substantive role in the government of the country. None the less, she attends Parliament and can vote, although her health is extremely frail. A Labour Member gave the example of Roosevelt. Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that the people of London should not be able to bring pressure to bear on somebody not to continue in his post when he has such seniority of office and runs the city?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for even remotely suggesting that you were fatuous, Mr. O'Hara. I was, of course, not doing so. I was, however, happily suggesting that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was fatuous, as he invariably is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about four-year terms. I hope, for the individual's sake, that the example that the hon. Gentleman gave of the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka did not arise three, six or nine months after an election. I would have hoped that someone would have spotted that the woman concerned was an 82-year-old who was a bit debilitated and not an appropriate choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman gave an unfortunate example when he was speaking about a tangential point in the American context. He mentioned Muskie, who came from Maine. He was hounded out of office by precisely the sort of vexatious rumour mongering that might now be institutionalised and formalised by the recall referendums that have been proposed. Sometime in his dim and distant past, Muskie had electrotherapy for a bout of depression and was hounded out of the vice-presidency nomination for his party because of that. Colleagues—I nearly said, "Comrades"—might remember the tears in his eyes as he was hounded out of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the new clauses—even that tabled by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who spoke about the trigger point of nine members—does anything to allay my fears about vexatious attempts to get rid of the mayor. That is certainly the experience in America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone can play silly little "What if?" games, and I suppose that some hon. Members will do so frequently in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go on then, for entertainment, if for nothing else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for the gracious way in which the hon. Gentleman gave way. While we are on the subject of Edmund Muskie, am I not right in saying that he was not hounded out of office? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is thinking to Tom Eagleton. Edmund Muskie stood unsuccessfully for Vice-President and then, as I recall, resumed his role as senator for Maine. He subsequently became a member of the Cabinet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not hear me. I said that he was hounded off the ticket, not hounded out of office. If we dwell—as I think is appropriate—on some of the American examples, they do not stand much scrutiny, not least for some of the reasons suggested by Opposition Members in defence of their little new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases the quorum, or trigger floor, in terms of recall balance, is woefully low. I will bore the Committee in a moment with the example of British Columbia because it is a useful device for examining some of the other points made by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In California, the quorum for a recall is effectively 12 per cent.—not 12 per cent. of those registered on the voting roll, which is in itself a dubious figure in the American context,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
but 12 per cent. of those who voted the last time that that particular official was voted into office. In many cases, the figure required in referendums on recall is 12 per cent. of the 25 per cent. of people who had bothered to vote in an election, which is a woefully small number. That will lead, as most recall referendums do, to vexatious and spurious attempts to obtain recalls in that fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, in the new clauses that he is speaking against, there is a dichotomy between the theorising and the practicalities? For example, in Washington, Marion Barry was a mayor who, by any reasonable interpretation, could be described as having completely lost the plot. None the less, he was re-elected by a massive majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comparable situation in Chicago was the administration of the second mayor Daley—Richard Daley Junior—which was characterised for many of us by an endless and constant flow of recall petitions that paralysed the administration of the city. The situation was characterised for many of us by the large sign apparent during the Richard Daley recall campaign, which said something like, "women of Chicago want their Dick Daley." Very little business was done by the administration. Does my hon. Friend agree that here again we see the dichotomy between the ideal and the real worlds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the substantive point made by my hon. Friend, if not with some of the detail. A close look at some of the north American experiences, which are the most appropriate examples, will show how in reality, behind the overall figures for the use of recall ballots, recalls are not the wonderful democratic tool of accountability that has been suggested. They are used, more often than not, by the embittered and the vanquished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recalls are used at all levels in me American context, so overall cumulative figures are meaningless. To suggest that there have been 185 or 200 recalls in Georgia since inception, or 80 recalls from 1974 to 1981 in Oregon, misses me point. More often man not, those recalls are at small-town level, and although they involve more man the dog catcher or the registrar of births—those examples perhaps over-simplify the matter—they often do not amount to much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been attempts to recall five of the last seven Californian governors, but the petitions failed because they require more than one million votes. They were almost exclusively partisan generated. Regan's republicans were against Brown, and vice versa when Regan was in office. To suggest that the new clause proposes an acute tool or device for the people of London does not stand up to scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument that the recall powers have been tried but have not succeeded is not an argument against me new clause, but an argument for it. Giving people the power to see whether they could get 10 per cent. of the electorate, properly defined, on their side, would at least provide them with an opportunity to succeed. If they could not, they would realise that the public were not going to support what they were doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that. That seems to be the opposite and equal case that anywhere that a recall referendum succeeded, it would have succeeded for legitimate reasons. That is not the case at all. Referendums are devices that in many instances— although not all, with the increase of single-issue politics in the United States—become simply another device in the partisan process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may therefore reach a stage—I shall come to this shortly when discussing some other clauses—where, for example, in May 2002 there could be a Lib-Lab, or non-Tory, two-thirds majority in the assembly and the Conservatives could have managed to get their shoplifter-cum-insider-trader elected. In that context, it would be possible—for entirely malevolent reasons that are not in the interests of the people of London—to get rid of poor, dear old Jeffrey before he had had a chance to exercise what he has paid so much to exercise now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to new clause 2, so unably moved by the hon. member for Kingston and Surbiton, the mayor could be removed not by a two-thirds majority of the assembly, but—under the rules set out in clause 45 governing a quorum—by as few as seven people voting to get rid of him. The new clause does not require an absolute two-thirds majority of the 25 members of the assembly; it simply requires a two-thirds majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are, quite rightly, not setting out in detail the internal mechanisms and standing orders of the assembly. As clause 45 states, it is a matter for the assembly to set its quorum. However, the Tokyo example quoted by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is not that far from the proposal in new clause 2, because of the sloppy drafting of that new clause. If we assume that 40 per cent. is a fair and reasonable level for a quorum, that would translate into about 10 members of the assembly. Therefore, on a vote of seven to three, under the new clause, seven individual assembly members could overturn what up to five million people had voted for in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard all that cant and nonsense about Opposition Members being democrats at heart, and all this being about accountability; well, it is not. The only absolutely honest speech we have heard—in terms of sincerity rather than accuracy—was that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East. His position has been entirely consistent: he does not want a mayor. He said that to start with, and in the context of such a conflagration between the mayor and the assembly, this is exactly the sort of reason why he did not want one in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contend, not least because of the American model, that both the referendum and the recall would be profoundly undemocratic. There is a body of misunderstanding on the Opposition Benches as to how distinct those two franchises are. It is not in the gift of the assembly to determine what direction the mayor should take, or for how long the mayor should survive in office;
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
nor is it in its gift to treat the mayor's executive position like that of the leader of the local club, or, indeed, of a Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give some figures to highlight the difficulties involved in holding a referendum. British Columbia has just had its first recall petitions. As the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst pointed out, in British Columbia it is not permissible to mess around and call a recall referendum willy-nilly. First, one needs the support of 40 per cent. of the registered voters—not 40 per cent. of those who voted last time—and the proposers of the recall petition have to be fully armed with details of how they, not the state, are going to pay for it. There are limits on how much they can pay for it and a process to determine the expenditure limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is instructive to spend a little time considering the limits. In British Colombia, there is a place called Prince George North—a delightful place, I am sure—with 22,271 registered voters. The limited expenditure to secure 8,908 of those voters—40 per cent. of them—is 28,000 Canadian dollars. The British Colombian authorities then have 42 days to verify the signatures of 8,908 voters. That might be a generous allocation of time, but will there be sufficient time to verify each of the 504,000 signatures required under new clause 1, given the current electorate, or the 1,000,080 under the new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weakest argument for all these sixth-form new clauses is cost. It is fine if democracy costs a fortune. However, to verify properly and to give all the due notice outlined in the new clauses and to fit them in with the rest of the Bill would take about two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a scenario—on which we have wasted the best part of two hours—where the mayor is elected, he or she goes ga ga after about six months, after 30 days or after whatever period the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggests, and we have 35 days to call an election under clause 16. There is no provision for the verification process, or for who is going to pay and why, and neither is there any provision for the period allowed to verify the signatures. However, if the process is carried out properly, I would contend—not with a smile on my face, but seriously—that from start to finish, assuming that the mayor has gone ga ga after only about six or nine months, the process would take about two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More often than not the process would run straight into the six-month block that prevents an election either for the assembly or for the mayor within six months of the next election. Such a process would have nothing to do with democracy or accountability, and to suggest such a process is fundamentally to misunderstand the nature of the relationship between the mayor, the assembly and their respective franchises. That would be an honest position to take if one were against the idea of a mayor from the start, which is the entirely reasonable position of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East. In all other circumstances, however, it is famous sixth-form nonsense and should be slung out without further discussion or encouragement—in Japanese or any other language— from the anoraks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the comments of the hon. Member for Harrow, East, it struck me forcefully that any of us could read out the arguments of Ministers and then receive a speech from the hon. Member for Harrow, East telling us why they could not be supported. It seems that yet again he has displayed his ability to argue that black is white and white is black but he has done very little more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to return to what the debates are about: the deficiency of accountability in the institution and how we go about rectifying that problem. It is clear from earlier debates that the Government are not willing to concede any changes in the balance between assembly and the mayor. Therefore we must look at how we ensure that the people of London have at their disposal a means to remove the mayor in the circumstances that my hon. Friends the Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Kingston and Surbition described earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The configuration of the mayor and assembly in the Bill does not—as the hon. Member for Croydon, South said earlier—put the assembly in the role of the legislature that we have in this place. It puts the assembly in the role of poodle to the mayor in that it is not given any means to act as an effective check or balance. Those who are now scrutinising the measures outside this place are beginning to recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will share with the Committee concerns that have been expressed by a number of constituents. Two weeks ago my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) and I held a consultation meeting with local voluntary organisations, including churches, schools, and residents' associations in our two constituencies to discuss the Government's proposals. To be as fair as we could, we used the Department's briefing material to structure that presentation, and we detailed the relationship that would exist between the mayor and the assembly under the Government's plans. We answered questions, constantly referring to the Government's briefing to ensure that we did not colour the presentation. The Minister for London and Construction is laughing, but there were many people there of his persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that came back very forcefully from people was, "How do we get rid of the mayor?" The answer was that they could get rid of the mayor only after four years, or by fulfilling the specific legal requirements in terms of audits and so on. That horrified people. Some people commented that, had they been aware at the time of the referendum that that was the balance of power being struck between the assembly and the mayor, they would not have supported the referendum. Time will tell whether that is a view that will be held widely in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not prepared to strike a better balance between the assembly and the mayor, we need to make sure that the mayor is more clearly accountable to London through recall procedures. That is at the core of the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a most important point. The Committee will have benefited from the allusion to his constituents' responses to the lack of accountability in the mayoralty. Might the referendum result not have been different if the people of London had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
been able to vote on the mayoralty separately from the assembly? Perhaps they wanted the assembly, and cast a blind eye to the deficiency of accountability within the mayoral office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I will not stray too far into a debate about the framing of the referendum question because we have had that debate ad nauseam. However, the point is a fair one that needs to be made now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor can have his policy and his capital budget without the assembly's being able to change them. He can have his revenue budget without the assembly having any genuine scope for changing it. Given that, it seems to me that we need to make sure that there are other ways in which the mayor can be held to account. That is why we have attempted, in the new clauses, to reflect genuine concerns that exist outside this place about how the mayor will be accountable through his term, not just at the beginning and end of it. For that reason I support new clauses 1 and 2, and urge the Government to give serious consideration to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the first few sittings of the Committee, the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives focused their minds on various issues relating to electoral arrangements and to constitution. In my view, they did so without taking into account the broad package—the raft of measures contained in the Bill. The mayor will be elected with a powerful mandate, because of the supplementary vote system that we will adopt. It would seem wrong to do as the new clauses suggest and give the assembly power to remove the mayor's powerful mandate soon afterwards.

My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East has already referred to the assembly's powers, but it is worth repeating them for the balance of the argument. Clauses 49, 50, and 51 give power to require attendance, power to review and investigate, and proposals by the assembly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just referred to powers to investigate, but what will be the results of such investigations? The assembly has not been extended any powers to do anything once it has concluded its investigations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman denies the powers that assembly members will have in such situations. They will act as scrutineers, having been elected to perform that duty. If I were a member of the assembly, I would scrutinise what the mayor does in that way and with those powers. The hon. Gentleman's point is entirely wrong.

There is also the important power in clause 72 and schedule 5 in relation to the budget, and the power to require the attendance of the mayor at meetings. In addition, there is the power of disqualification granted under the Audit Commission Act 1998 and disqualification because of a conviction under the Representation of the People Act 1983. Many of the points that have been made seem to ignore the provisions of the 1983 Act. Section 72 of the Local Government

Act 1972 deals with proceedings for disqualification and the courts have powers in individual instances. For example, if a mayor acts ultra vires, the powers exist to go to court and they will not be taken away. The assembly could pass a vote of no confidence and the implication of such a vote should not be ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman spell out the implications of a vote of no confidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. A vote of no confidence would be a public issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are waiting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please let me develop the point. If the assembly passed a vote of no confidence, the whole of London would be aware of that. I fail to see how a mayor could continue with his policies while ignoring such a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not put such a provision in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is necessary. The ability to pass a vote of no confidence is inherent in the powers of the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we tabled an amendment proposing that the mayor would have to go if the assembly passed a vote of no confidence, would the hon. Gentleman support it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mayor would have to take such a vote into account in his actions. The hon. Gentleman ignores the executive power of the mayor. If we gave the assembly the power to remove the mayor with just a vote of no confidence, that could be used as a challenge to the mandate of the mayor. It would be wrong to do that.

	<i>[Interruption.]</i> However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East suggests, if we oppose the election of the mayor, we can have this argument with justification. If, as we propose, the mayor is to have executive powers, it is wrong for us to curtail those powers given the other checks and balances that will exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman the question that I asked the hon. Member for Harrow, East. If the mayor were found to have committed perjury, does the hon. Gentleman think that the mayor should resign. Will he acknowledge that, if the mayor refused to do so, there would be no mechanism to remove him from office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the mayor were convicted of perjury, he would be disqualified under the provisions of the Bill. A prosecution could be brought for perjury, and the mayor could be disqualified if the case was that serious. The power is clearly included in the Bill. I hope that that answers the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has answered the point in a deeply confused way. If the clear majority— we can argue about the percentage—of members of the assembly, in the exercise of their critical faculties on behalf of constituency and London-wide electors, feel that the mayor is acting wholly in dereliction of his duty to Londoners as set out in the Bill, they will not have a mechanism to remove him. Would the hon. Gentleman be satisfied if that were the case in any democratic assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the mayor was acting ultra vires, as the hon. Gentleman implies, the power exists, through the courts, to remove the mayor.

The recall procedure would be expensive. In democratic terms, the proposal is defensible. However, the difficulties of validation of a petition in a city of 8 million or 9 million people are so complicated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
