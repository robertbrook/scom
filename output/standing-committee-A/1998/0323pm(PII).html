	<ol>
	<li>The validity of proceedings of the Environment Strategy Group for London is not affected by any vacancy among the members or any defect in the appointment of any member.".</li></ol></p>
	<p>I remind the Committee once again that this is a revised selection list and that amendment No. 1212 was not in the original selection.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am moving amendment No. 543, I shall speak to the amendments in my name. The thrust of the group of amendments lies in new clause 89 and new schedule 11, which call for the establishment of an environment strategy group for London. The group would provide advice to the mayor on the contents and implementation of the state of the environment report, specifically in relation to the municipal waste management strategy, the London biodiversity action plan, the London air quality strategy, the London ambient noise strategy and the London water plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper states on page 58:
	<br><q><p>"The government believes that urgent action now needs to be taken to improve London's environment and that the Mayor should be given specific environmental powers … It will be important that there is a team at the Mayor's disposal able to provide the technical support that will be required to ensure that this goal is met and that environmental initiatives are properly integrated with other strategies.</p></q>
The new clause and new schedule follow that thread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were surprised that there were no proposals to set up an environment strategy group. There is, for example, a culture strategy group and there are several others, but not one for advising the mayor on environmental matters. Professionals in the environmental sector should give advice based on their expertise. If chosen on that basis, and not on account of their relationship with the mayor, the group would be more likely to be less biased in its advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier parts of the Bill have not made any provision for an environment strategy group. As the mayor is limited to a maximum of 12 advisers in total, the proposals would provide a way for the Minister to provide the back-up that the mayor needs. It is worth noting that several Government Back Benchers criticised the Bill on Second Reading because it did not make provision for an environmental strategy group. Frankly, the Minister has some explaining to do about that. As I said, the professional expertise that could be provided is just the sort of back-up that the mayor will need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a large group of amendments that have slightly disparate purposes. Their main purpose, insofar as there is a common theme, is to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1472</span>
establish, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South emphasised in moving the amendment, the creation of an environmental strategy group. The amendments misunderstand the purpose of the authority. One specific part of the GLA's general purpose is to promote environmental improvement in London. In addition, the authority will have specific environmental responsibilities in respect of the preparation of strategies on waste, air quality, noise and biodiversity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is therefore no need to lay down in primary legislation how the mayor will obtain advice on, and organise the running of, his or her environmental responsibilities any more than in the part of the Bill that we discussed relating to the need for a separate planning advisory group to advise the mayor on how he or she should discharge his or her planning responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was clear that we wanted a structure that avoided unnecessary bureaucracy and an unnecessary proliferation of committees. We wanted a structure that clearty defined the responsibility. The responsibility rests with the mayor and, as is clear in the Bill, the mayor is subject to extensive duties to consult. We have already given undertakings on how we will come back to the duties to consult to ensure that they are truly and accurately focused in the most appropriate way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to fulfil the authority's general purpose, the mayor will have to put arrangements in place to obtain advice from environmental experts on all of his or her policies and proposals. This will have to be built into the management structures of both the authority and the functional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes it clear how far we differ from the Opposition's approach. Their amendment would compartmentalise the treatment of environmental matters within the GLA by making them the responsibility of a separate environmental strategy group. There would be no read-across to the GLA's other functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Mayor should retain the flexibility to make arrangements to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account in all the authority's actions. The mayor's flexibility in this area should not be restricted by primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the point of devolving power, if one seeks to predetermine the minutiae of how that power can be used or if one carefully draws up working methods to which those to whom power is devolved must adhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor may decide to work in a number of different ways to ensure that proper account is taken of environmental issues across the entire authority. That might be done through the setting up of a strategy group. It might be done by using a round table model, made up of senior officers from the GLA, its functional bodies and other environmental experts. It might be done by appointing a series of environmental experts to work throughout the authority on the entire range of its responsibilities. More probably, it will be done by a combination of all these options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1473</span>
As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the mayor will have the benefit of expert and professional staff who will come into the new authority as a result of the structure that we are creating. In particular the expert body, the London Ecology Unit, which has done first-rate work in recent years, will provide expertise for the mayor from the establishment of the new authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made the Government's position clear. We do not support the establishment of an outside body of experts to advise the mayor or to write strategies on his or her behalf. Consequently, we do not support the amendments that propose this; nor can we support any of the amendments that are consequential upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one consequential amendment within this group that I would like to speak to in a little detail. Amendment No. 1212 would require the mayor to consult the environment strategy group and the London boroughs on the London ambient noise strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot support the element of the amendment that implies the need to establish an environment strategy group. Nor is the part requiring the mayor to consult the London boroughs necessary, as earlier clauses already require the mayor to consult all London local authorities on all his or her strategies, of which noise is one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am prepared to consider the case for including the Environment Agency as a statutory consultee for the noise strategy. The Environment Agency is a statutory consultee for the three other environment strategies: waste, air quality and biodiversity. I accept that there is a case to be made for the agency to be consulted by the mayor on the noise strategy. That case is strengthened by the fact that I understand the agency is about to take on some responsibility for noise as a result of the Pollution Prevention and Control Bill, which is currently making its passage through Parliament. I undertake to consider the point on this part of the amendment further and, if appropriate, to come back with a further amendment at a later stage. I hope that in the light of my comments the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about consulting the London Ecology Committee. As I understand it, it will cease to exist under clause 260.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. The London Ecology Committee will cease to exist because it is a Committee drawn from the boroughs to oversee the work of the London Ecology Unit. The unit is made up of professional staff—I am pleased to see that the director is listening to our debate—who have done an excellent job. They will transfer into the GLA and be available to give expert advice to the mayor and the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has therefore gone some way towards answering my next point, which was who will provide that advice. He must explain why we have a strategy to deal with culture matters but not waste matters. He has gone to great lengths to explain how I have misunderstood this, but there is a fairly fundamental point here about the nature of the people who are on these groups. A strategy group that is appointed in the way that a number of groups are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1474</span>
appointed by the authority has a degree of independence, and we favour that slight arm's length approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing different aspects of the mayor's responsibilities. The mayor's responsibilities in respect of the environment, as with planning, are clear and direct executive responsibilities. There is an obligation to produce specific environmental strategies in the same way that there is an obligation to prepare the spacial development strategy and to take a view on strategic planning applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, the mayor's responsibilities in respect of culture, which we shall come on to consider probably later this week, are more an expression of partnership in which the mayor will be working with a range of other organisations and will need to assist and support the development of initiatives of other organisations. There will not be the same specific executive responsibilities. That is the reason for the distinction in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different structures are applicable for certain responsibilities; I have described planning and the environment. There are others where there is a need for an advisory group such as the cultural strategy group or where the mayor will be working through a specific executive such as Transport for London, separate from the authority. That is the reason for the difference. The mayor has specific executive responsibilities in respect of the environment and we want the mayor to discharge directly those responsibilities directly and to rely on the expert advice that he or she will have available on those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation although I am not completely satisfied. I should have thanked him at the outset for his reaction to amendment No. 1212. At least we got one hit from our shotgun approach. If the Minister is satisfied that good quality, independent advice is available to the mayor I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 961, in page 123, line 31, after "appropriate", add—
	<br><q><p>"(4) A state of the environment report shall also set performance targets in the above areas and assess progress in achieving those targets.".</p></q>
I Will endeavour to keep my speech brief, having learned from the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He scored many hits earlier today by doing just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 961 supports the Government's intentions in establishing a detailed environmental report as set out in subsection (3). Our amendment would require that that report gives performance targets to enable a full assessment of its measures to be given. That would help to give the report focus and purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1475</span>
The Minister may suggest that we are being over-prescriptive. However, she should be wary of making such a charge because subsection (3) is pretty prescriptive. We are attempting to build on the aims of the list in subsection (3) to ensure that the report is of great value to the mayor, the assembly and the people of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My contribution will be extremely brief and concerns semantics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once upon a time, I had ministerial responsibilities for the British library. At that time, books were leaving the shelves and appearing on the floor in a spectral manner. I was given an elaborate briefing for occasions when I might have to answer questions on that subject. The briefing provided by the British library included the memorable sentence:
	<br><q><p>"Shelves, being inanimate objects, cannot throw anything."</p></q>
That is relevant in the context of the amendment No. 961, which implies that the state of the environment report will set performance targets. Of course, the author of the report will set those targets, not the report itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember the right hon. Gentlemen urging that the mayor has a duty to consult bodies dealing with higher and further education. I am beginning to think that he is himself a body of higher and further education and that attending this Committee is a course involving a wide range of interests and intellectual delights.

Regrettably, we must return to rather more prosaic arguments concerning the minutiae of ensuring that the Bill meets the Government's desired outcomes. We are sympathetic to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), but we cannot support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require the mayor to set performance targets for all areas covered by the state of the environment report. As the Committee has heard, the report will contain sections on areas of indirect interest to the mayor. He or she will have no strategic role in those areas, but London will benefit from mayoral interest and scrutiny on matters such as litter and water quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be inappropriate and unreasonable to require the mayor to set performance indicators in areas that are not within the mayoral responsibility. The indicators would, inevitably, be meaningless if they applied to the GLA, as the GLA would have no direct responsibility for achieving them. The indicators would be patently unfair and ineffective if they applied to local authorities, because the mayor will have no remit to set indicators and no ability to enforce their achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state of the environment report is not the right place to require the adoption of performance indicators. Of course, the GLA will be covered by best value and therefore it will need a series of performance indicators to assess the level of performance for all its functions, including the environment. Performance indicators will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1476</span>
play a part in the GLA's make-up as a requirement of best value and we expect that relevant nationally applied indicators will apply to the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind Committee members of the commitment that we made in previous sittings to consider whether the mayor's strategy should include some form of benchmarking. We shall certainly consider the need for that in light of best value and inform the Committee of our conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In light of such assurances, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister made helpful observations on my amendment. I accept the points that she made and I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1198, in page 123, line 31, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(3A) For the purposes of subsection 3(g) above, information about waste means—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>domestic waste production recycling and disposal</p></q>
	<br><q><p>non-domestic waste production, recycling and disposal.".</p></q>
The state of the environment report will contain information about a list of matters, including waste disposal, as specified in paragraph (g). Waste should be split into domestic and non-domestic or commercial waste. Disposal authorities charge a considerable levy, which is passed on to the boroughs, which recover it through council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Domestic rubbish is generated by houses, schools, parks, street cleansing and fly tipping. The rest is commercial waste. Much waste is now recycled, but that initiative is not taking off as quickly as this Government would like or previous Governments would have liked. The boroughs are losing the incentive to recycle, as prices—of paper and glass, in particular—have collapsed and they are unable to set a long-term strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The global market for paper, for example, has collapsed because Germany and the USA have distorted the market by dumping. Glass recycling is not developing because recyclers are claiming a glut and keeping prices low. That led to Merton almost cancelling its recycling scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is familiar with the credit system. We must distinguish between the domestic and the non-domestic markets. The annual report must separate the two, in much the same way that rubbish ought to be sorted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to tell the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is wholly unnecessary. Many people use "waste" to describe waste from many domestic and non-domestic sources. Had the clause intended a more limited interpretation, that would have been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1477</span>
The hon. Gentleman argued that the recycling market fluctuates, using the examples of glass and paper. Including a definition in the Bill is unnecessary and would not have any influence on market forces. I understood the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but his amendment would have no effect: it would not achieve its desired outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, all local authorities examine their duty to recycle and other matters relating to waste disposal. In future, they must do that even more carefully. That holds true for the domestic environment too. I was surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman say that the issue of recycling has not taken off. Certainly, the experience in my constituency—which has been confirmed by colleagues—is that residents push strongly for facilities to be provided so that they can separate within their domestic waste materials that can be recycled, easily stored and eventually collected. However, I am wandering somewhat from the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman believes that major changes can be made within the marketplace as a result of changing the wording of the Bill. I have to tell him that his hope is somewhat misplaced and, in terms of desired outcomes, his amendment is unnecessary. I therefore ask him to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have made it clear that this is a probing amendment, tabled because we felt that there was a need for different strategies. If the Minister is saying that the same effect can be produced by keeping all waste together, so be it. However, I suspect that when the various reports are drawn up, the first half will deal with domestic waste and the second half with commercial waste. The net effect will be exactly the same. Different people will look at different issues. However, the Minister wants to keep the different types of waste grouped together, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has had many debates on the need for consultation and about different lists of potential consultees—sometimes existing, sometimes not. I shall not go into the general principles of consultation; I want to keep my remarks brief and focused on the specific consultees that we propose to add to the list in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 962 would add "appropriate non-governmental organisations"—wide but more specific than the Government's proposals under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1478</span>
paragraph (d). It would help to include in various consultations with the mayor groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 970 would add bodies and consultees that would certainly be useful to the mayor. The Minister will say that the Food Standards Agency does not yet exist, but I am sure that the Government intend to establish it and that it has wide support across Parliament. It certainly will exist in due course. The Health and Safety Executive and the regional director of public health are very much in existence and would be helpful to the mayor in drawing up the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, in essence this group of amendments relates to consultation arrangements for the state of the environment report. The amendments would add to the list of statutory consultees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with amendment No. 970. It was originally intended to be considered at the same time as amendment No. 969, which sought to include new sections in the state of environment report on housing conditions, communicable diseases, occupational health and safety, food safety and the effects of the environment on human health. The Committee has already debated and rejected amendment No. 969, so it would not be sensible to spend any more time on amendment No. 970, which is, in effect, meaningless in isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 962, the Committee will be delighted to hear that is is entirely unnecessary. Let me remind the Committee of the existing consultation for the state of the environment report, for which the Mayor is required to consult the Environment Agency, each London borough council and the common council, and any other person whom the mayor considers it appropriate to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will note that last phrase. The mayor is already required to consult any other person whom he or she deems appropriate. The amendment is therefore unnecessary, because the non-governmental organisations that the hon. Gentleman seeks to include are already caught by the last category. In the light of that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite convinced by the Minister's response. We felt that it would be helpful to include the definition "appropriate non-govermental organisations" in the Bill. Although amendment No. 969 was not accepted, we feel that the organisations that are set out in amendment No. 970 could still give the mayor useful advice on the matters that are covered by subsection (3). However, we do not wish to press the amendment to a Division, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments probe the Government's intentions with regard to measuring road traffic levels so as to meet their road traffic reduction targets. We tabled the amendments to find out exactly how the Government propose to measure road traffic levels. Measuring the number of vehicles may not give sufficient clarity in terms of congestion. Amendment No. 1144, which relates to the volume of motorised traffic, would provide a much wider description of congestion. Amendments Nos. 963 and 964 would include in the Bill clearer reference to the fact that measurements must take account of different types of road vehicles because they have different effects on congestion. Policies may want to discourage some types of vehicles but not others. The amendments were intended to be helpful, and I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with an issue that is of major importance to London. A recent report showed that Park lane is the most polluted street in the whole of the United Kingdom, and London First recently published another report showing that congestion and pollution, impacting as they do on the quality of life in London, are major contributory factors for those deciding whether to make inward investment in our capital city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments probe an area that the Government acknowledge to be of great importance. However, they seek to specify exactly what information on road traffic must be included under various headings in the mayor's state of the environment report. Our overall approach to the GLA, as we have explained many times, is to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on it. Indeed, paragraph 5.116 of the White Paper states in relation to the mayor's environment report:
	<br><q><p>"The number and type of indicators will not be described in legislation".</p></q>
I have already touched on the importance that the Government attach not only to the reduction of traffic growth but to the reduction of traffic, in absolute terms, in areas with the highest levels of congestion and pollution. That undoubtedly applies to parts of London. In the light of the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997, Mr. Deputy Speaker—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been demoted again. I am Mr. O'Hara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. O'Hara. We are mindful of the fact that the Road Traffic Reduction Act has reached the statute book and that boroughs are therefore required to assess and report on the levels of local road traffic in their areas. That requirement includes targets and the duty to have regard to the Secretary of State's guidance. However, we want to ensure that Transport for London has a statutory role
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1480</span>
after the mayor has been elected and the GLA has come into power. We do not want to split between TfL and the boroughs' duties and responsibility for specific roads. We therefore propose that boroughs should act in conjunction with TfL when undertaking their duty, assessing traffic levels and preparing their reports. As I said, boroughs will have to have regard to the Secretary of State's guidance. They will also have to work within the mayor's integrated strategy and their own local implementation plans, comply with any mayoral directions and have regard to mayoral guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of our ideal aims of the delivery of reduction in road traffic and of an absolute reduction in real terms, we believe that it is necessary to review subsection (5) of the clause. We intend to return to the issue later, for the reasons that I have given. I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of my response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question that I should like to ask in the light of the end of the Minister's remarks. Earlier in her speech, she corrected a statement made previously, which suggested that Pall Mall was the most polluted thoroughfare in the country. She opted for Park lane, and I assume that she was right, partly because it outstrips Pall Mall on the monopoly board and partly because the Minister said it. As a matter of curiosity, can the Minister tell us whether the Park lane problem—I refer to it because Park lane is situated in my constituency—is related to moving traffic or to the enormous coach park that lines the whole of its western side? I am not referring to the road haulage vehicles that were there this week. In the coach park, continental drivers especially will cheerfully leave their engines running while their vehicles are stationary to preserve their air conditioning. It is extremely difficult to control such activities through traffic wardens under current law. Does the hon. Lady know what particular factors make Park lane the worst thoroughfare?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I am unable to answer the right hon. Gentleman's question. It does intrigue me, however, and I shall exercise my best efforts to come up with a more detailed answer. I am surprised about the enforcement difficulties to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. I understood that under current legislation it is an offence to run an engine causing such problems—as it invariably will if the fuel that is used is not as clean and green as possible and if relevant catalytic traps and converters have not been fitted. I shall certainly look into the issue, and I trust that I shall be able to furnish the right hon. Gentleman with a more detailed reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister's reply was rather longer than my opening remarks, it was informative and assuring.

if there was one—
	<br><q><p>"shall from time to time consider necessary and appropriate."</p></q>
I tabled the amendment before an earlier amendment of mine, amendment No. 543, fell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much public concern about the matter. I am always astonished by the depth of knowledge that laymen have about such things. Until the dialogues that we have just had, I always thought that Oxford street was the most polluted street in London. When I think of the flowers that Westminster council has so superbly put down the middle of Park lane, I simply cannot believe that it is the most polluted street in London. Nevertheless, there is an awful lot of information about air quality in which the public are interested, and items should be addressed individually. I hope that the Minister will take the point on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that an ever-growing number of people are becoming concerned about what is being pumped into our air. They are becoming infinitely more expert not only about what the pollutants are but about their impact on our health. One thing that I always find surprising is how many young children are experts on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1482</span>
issue. They can be as educative as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster is on most other aspects of the Committee's deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would prescribe exactly what the mayor must include in the air quality section of the state of the environment report. I strongly endorse and welcome the wish that the hon. Member for Croydon, South expresses in the amendment to draw attention to the importance of the list of pollutants. I am sure that he is aware that they are identical to those listed in the national air quality strategy and that the Government ascribe particular importance to that strategy. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary because the mayor will already be required to pay particular regard to the pollutants that are listed in the amendment. Under clause 252, the mayor will be required to implement the national air quality strategy in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1197 is similar in effect, but allows the environment strategy group to add to the list at a future date. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that we may suddenly discover pollutants in the future about which we know precisely nothing at the moment. We have, however, already debated and rejected the Opposition's amendments on the environment strategy group. The Committee will not welcome the airing of those arguments again. As that proposal was rejected, it would not be appropriate to consider amendment No. 1197 further.

Amendment No. 1201 lists various bodies that should be consulted in drawing up the strategy: the environmental strategy group, the London Ecology Unit, the London Wildlife Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Groundwork Foundation. All those groups have expressed concern that the mayor will not be required to consult them when drawing up the plan. The White Paper states that community-based initiatives are still important, and those groups may form part of such initiatives, as well as being authoritative in their own fields.

It would be appropriate to provide for unspecified non-governmental organisations in clause 243(3)(d), so that the London biodiversity action plan can be fully consulted on by as wide a group as possible.

I was interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South of the presence of otters in London. I am not sure whether they have made a return. From time to time, when T stand on the Terrace in the middle of winter, I feel that i would like to be a little otter myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to say that he had seen some Pipistrelle black bats flying past the window.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going into the enormous variety of wildlife that exists in London—it has clearly tickled the fancy of Committee members—I should stress that we are concerned with consultation arrangements for the biodiversity action plan. The mayor is specifically required to consult English Nature, the Countryside Commission and the Environment Agency. In addition to the above, the hon. Member for Croydon, South may recall that clause 34 sets out a list of statutory consultees for all the mayor's strategies, of which the biodiversity action plan will be one. That list includes not just the assembly, the functional bodies and the London boroughs, but anyone else whom the mayor deems it appropriate to consult. As we have said on many occasions, we do not believe it appropriate to produce exhaustive lists of consultees; it is right to set out a broad framework which will facilitate and encourage wide consultation with appropriate bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 965, which was tabled by the hen. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Once again, the hon. Gentleman's amendment is entirely unnecessary because the non-governmental organisations that he seeks to include are already caught in the last category
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1485</span>
that I described. I hope that he accepts the reassurance that I am trying to offer—that there is already proper scope for consultation with a wide range of interested bodies. His amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we have reached amendment No. 1200—a phenomenal number—may have caused a certain amount of confusion to the hon. Member for Croydon, South. I am grateful for his attempt to explain his reason for tabling the amendment. It would add the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and English Nature to the list of statutory consultees for the biodiversity action plan, but I am afraid that I cannot accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman was seeking to achieve in tabling the amendment. On the face of it, it appears that he wanted two organisations, the first called the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and the second called English Nature, to be statutory consultees for the biodiversity action plan. However, life and legislation are not so simple. We all know which Organisation the hon. Gentleman means when he refers to English Nature, but I must break it to him that that term has no legal status whatever. It is a little known fact that English Nature's real name, as legally defined in section 128 of the Environment Protection Act 1990, is the Nature Conservancy Council for England. I must point out that the Bill already lists the Nature Conservancy Council for England as a statutory consultee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is further confusion on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. That is the name used by two organisations together—the Committee may not be surprised to hear that they are English Nature and its equivalent body in Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales. Thus, the amendment would have the curious effect of requiring the mayor to consult English Nature, but only in its joint capacity with the Countryside Council for Wales. I do not believe that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention. Given the assurance that English Nature has the statutory right of consultation on the action plan, I am sure that he will be convinced to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third amendment in the group, No. 1201, would add to the number of statutory consultees for the biodiversity action plan. We have already touched on some of them. We debated the environmental strategy group and explained why it was not necessary as a body. I explained that the London Ecology Unit would be absorbed into the GLA. Those two names in the amendment are clearly inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the others are concerned, we are well aware of the sterling work of the London Wildlife Trust, the RSPB and the Groundwork Foundation. They all continue to do that good work as members of the London Biodiversity Partnership. I expect that the mayor will want to consult the partnership on the London biodiversity action plan, as it will no doubt have a great deal to contribute and is an obvious consultee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, the amendment is unnecessary. For the reasons that I outlined, the mayor has adequate powers to consult and is encouraged to do so widely with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1486</span>
appropriate organisations. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will choose to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As far as amendment No. 1201 is concerned, I accept the Minister's point. As for amendment No. 1200, I should say in my defence that the Minister noted at the outset that it was perhaps a little-known fact in the Committee that the name "English Nature" did not have legal standing and that the correct name was the NCC. As a litigation lawyer, I know that if one sues something that is known as something else, one still hits the main target. The Minister may like to think about an amendment that would add the words "known as English Nature" to the expression in the Bill. Nevertheless, I am pleased to hear that the right organisation is in the list. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the last set of amendments, I said that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood would have been a valuable witness had he been present.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1488</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with some trepidation that I rise to speak to such a large group of amendments. Most of the amendments would do exactly the same thing—that is, take the word "municipal" out of the waste management strategy's title. Earlier today, my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was chided by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for taking that approach. The Committee will therefore understand my sense of trepidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important. We do not understand why the Government want to limit the mayor's waste management strategy to municipal waste. In London, the approximate volume of household waste is currently 4 million tonnes a year, and the volume of industrial and commercial waste is 11 million tonnes a year. If the mayor is to produce a waste management strategy that seeks to minimise waste to the fullest possible extent and deal with all the waste that is generated in the Greater London area, there is no role for the word "municipal" in the title of that strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy will be very important to the capital. I have been told by people who study such matters that if nothing is done—if we do not take a strategic approach to waste minimisation—London will be up to capacity in dealing with its waste by 2003. This is an important clause, which we support, but we believe that the mayor's waste minimisation strategy should be wider. We therefore hope that the Government will either explain that "municipal" includes all aspects of waste or accept the amendments and delete the word from the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially, the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton would place a duty on the mayor to prepare policies for dealing with all types of waste, not only municipal waste. That would represent a fundamental change not only to our proposals in the Bill but to our proposals in the White Paper, and to what we have consulted on and the people of London have voted on. We therefore do not believe that the thrust of the amendment, or its desired outcome, is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other wastes to which the amendments refer are types that do not fall to local government to deal with. We want the mayoral strategy to be a vehicle for securing real, concrete change. It must therefore contain policies that the mayor can deliver and implement—if necessary, through the mayoral powers of direction. The mayor has no powers of direction over private sector bodies in industry, business or commerce. There would be little value in the mayor developing a strategic plan of action for the management of waste generated by such bodies, especially if it contained measures that they find unpalatable. The Government believe, however, that the mayor should have a view about those other waste streams and how they should be dealt with. There may be important lessons to be learnt or good practice to be shared. That is why provisions considered earlier ensure that the state of the environment report contains information on all types of waste, including those not involved in the municipal waste management strategy. I hope that, in the light of my remarks the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1489</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's arguments less than convincing. I refer especially to her suggestion that the people of London have voted on the matter and that the Government therefore have a mandate to ensure that relevant waste is limited to municipal waste. I am sure that people who bothered to vote in the referendum did not have that specific issue in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems odd that the mayor cannot take commercial or industrial waste into account in his or her strategy. A strategy of the sort in question should not necessarily have to relate to the specific and direct responsibilities of a public body—in this case the mayor. As the Minister said, it is clearly right that the mayor should hold a view on waste, waste minimisation and waste management. Surely, such a view should be contained in the overall strategy, not in a separate environmental report. If the mayor is setting up transport and disposal schemes for municipal waste, he or she should try to work out those schemes with the private sector, which has a much larger amount of waste to dispose of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was therefore rather surprised by the Minister's arguments, which were unconvincing. I see that a note has been passed to her. Will she try to convince me a little further of her case? The issue is crucial for people involved in the waste management industry, both in local authorities and in the private sector. Such people will examine the Committee's proceedings; they would like to be told how the mayor is supposed to take an overarching strategic view about waste generated in the capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I do not want the hon. Gentleman to feel lonely and isolated, but the note to which he referred had nothing to do with his amendment. His comments lead me to believe that he is the only member of the Committee who was not convinced by my arguments. I shall, however, attempt yet again to set his mind at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he did not believe that the people of London knew that they had voted for the mayoral waste strategy. The Government's White Paper "A Mayor and Assembly for London" contains four lengthy paragraphs about municipal waste—5.124 to 5.127. I cannot believe that people who welcomed the idea of a directly elected mayor and the formation of the GLA would not have read that White Paper in detail, including the paragraphs on municipal waste, as London's waste management is of great importance to everyone who lives and works here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be no point in devising a municipal waste strategy under the mayoral imprimatur, with London believing that the mayor is committed to it, if the mayor was incapable of delivering it in respect of commercial waste that was not included in the definition of municipal waste. That would not only be a waste of the mayor's time, but would almost delude the people of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the mayor must have a view, and major shifts will sometimes have to occur. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke earlier about the need for minimisation, which he brought down to the reduction of packaging. Personally, I agree with his point of view. Many of the things that we buy come in an excessive amount of packaging. It never fails to amaze me how inordinately difficult it is to break into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1490</span>
some of that packaging; sometimes it seems that it would be easier to break into a bank safe than to open a packet of biscuits. None the less, the mayor has no powers to make changes to reduce packaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman wants to see in the mayoral strategy, the mayor has no powers to deliver. However, he does have the power to deliver his own waste strategy, and clearly his state of the environment report is required to take into consideration those wider issues of waste, which are outside the definition of "municipal". The mayor will undoubtedly be a powerful and influential figure, who will be able to speak to commerce and many of the businesses whose waste falls outside the definition of municipal. It would, however, be wrong to pretend to the people of London that the mayor will be able to deliver in this area, when the powers are not there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that I have, at the second attempt, managed to convince the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will probably not be surprised to learn that she has not convinced me. I have become used to the Government talking about partnership with the private sector, and I should have thought that such a concept could have been incorporated in the mayor's waste management strategy. Given that we need to make progress, however, I will not seek to divide the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I note the hon. Gentleman's intention to seek leave to withdraw the amendment, but I think that the Minister wants to speak to the Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, Mr. O'Hara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noted the intention of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I now call the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments redefine the term "municipal waste". As drafted, the definition of municipal waste covers only waste that the boroughs, as waste collection authorities, collect under a statutory duty set out in section 45 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, it has been pointed out that the wording excludes waste that householders themselves deliver to civic amenity sites, but with which the boroughs and the statutory disposal authorities have a duty to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is that the term "municipal waste" and the municipal waste management strategy should cover all waste with which local authorities in Greater London have a statutory duty to deal. The amendment therefore alters the definition of municipal waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1491</span>
This is a probing amendment with which to try to ascertain the Government's attitude to incineration in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 80 per cent, of all waste is landfilled, but there are no landfill sites in London, so there is no alternative but incineration. Every commentator whose work I have read says that recycling or the minimisation of waste through the use of less packaging, for example, will not eliminate the requirement to burn rubbish. What is not recycled is incinerated. The main London incineration plant is at Edmonton, with a smaller, privately owned plant at Selchip. A third plant at Belvedere was called in and planning permission was eventually refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disposal authorities are running out of landfill sites; they will have to find other ways of disposing of rubbish. There is a real problem to be faced from 2002. New sites are unlikely to be permitted by Kent and Essex—they are already saying that there should be no further new developments, and are even starting to place time constraints on when rubbish can be delivered to existing sites. Also, two new EU directives are expected to make opening up further landfill yet more difficult. So what will happen when the sites fill up? That is the big waste issue. The Government are now under some pressure to put forward a proposal and to explain their position. Concern has been expressed by LPAC and Friends of the Earth that incinerators will be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The perception of incinerators differs from the reality. Most of Birmingham's waste is burned, for example, and waste officers believe that the air coming out is cleaner than the air going in. Incinerators can also create heat and power as a by-product, and a growing number of companies can supply such combined heat and power plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have suggested that incinerator capacity be limited to 100,000 tonnes. That means that instead of just one incinerator at Edmonton, there would have to be five; while in the area covered by the Western Riverside waste authority, which deals with Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lambeth and the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea, there would have to be six, where currently there is only one transfer station—which, as we all know, is next to Wandsworth bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, the issue of whether there should be incinerators is dealt with only through the planning process, which leads to strong opposition from local authorities. That was what happened with the Belvedere plant. No proposals will ever endear any Government to huge swathes of residents who are concerned about incinerators. We had that problem in office, and I am happy to hand it over to the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of the waste authorities, the current situation is worrying. For example the Western Riverside waste authority's contract to dispose of rubbish collected by its constituent authorities runs out in 2002. The Government office for London is, I am informed, considering the details of the contract, rather
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1492</span>
than discussing how that huge waste authority will dispose of its rubbish once it can no longer dump it in Essex. The contractual position is important for commercial reasons, but it is of greater importance to know what general policy will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that many people consider this a most important subject. If I have caught her by surprise, and she does not have the precise policy at her fingertips, I should be happy if she would undertake to set it out. We will be most interested to hear the Government's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the hon. Member for Croydon, South has raised an issue of major importance. I think that he would agree that it is not of exclusive importance to London; it is of importance throughout the United Kingdom. However, we are discussing the issue in relation to London, where specific and difficult problems are concerned. We are all aware that traditional landfill sites can no longer be filled. Local authorities are rightly objecting to the level of landfill sites rising above ground level. There are also considerations relating to the transportation of waste that are particular to London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to say that I trust that the hon. Gentleman will be comforted or consoled, but I doubt that that will be his response when I tell him that the issue of waste disposal is vital. The Government have been considering it for some time. I am sure that he is aware that we want the mayor to promote an integrated approach to waste management. Indeed, in our consultation paper "Less Waste, More Value", we stated that we are committed to an increase in energy recovery but that it should not be undertaken without first considering the possibility of composting and material recovery. The national strategy for all local authorities will have to take waste management into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already touched on the requirement for waste minimisation—which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised earlier today—collection and transportation, re-use, recycling, composting, energy from waste and final disposal. It would be for the mayor to decide proposals and policies to be included in the waste strategy but they must be consistent with the national policy. Here again, because of the national consideration and taking a long-term view, the Secretary of State will have a reserve power of direction in the unlikely event that the mayor's strategy is inconsistent with the national waste strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not easy decisions. The mayor will have a mandate from London which will assist in the making and carrying through of difficult decisions, but I am sure that no one is under any illusion that there is only one method of waste disposal. We will have to look at all the issues I have described in devising a national strategy. That undoubtedly will be the case for the mayor too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting for the Minister to talk about incineration. I do not feel that I have had an answer to my questions at all. What will happen as we run out of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1493</span>
landfill sites? Does the Minister envisage that there will be more incineration in London? Does she envisage that there will be incinerators in the GLA area? She talks about the mayor complying with the national policy—what is the national policy on incineration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concluded by saying to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that it would be foolish to presuppose that there is just one method of dealing with our waste. I have already listed for the Committee the approaches that we believe have to be taken in making these decisions. I have touched on the requirement for waste minimisation, collection and transportation, re-use, recycling, composting, energy from waste, which is incineration, and then the final disposal; but it is clearly absurd to pretend that there will be just one strategy or tactic or that we will tackle the issue successfully by excluding certain processes. There will be a national strategy and a requirement to examine all these ways for dealing with waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it from that that there will be more incineration in London. I quite agree with the Minister that it would be foolish to stick to one method of waste disposal. I put specific questions on incineration which the Minister has not fully answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question that the hon. Gentleman has posed twice is whether there will be more incineration in London. I pointed out that I—like all members of this Committee—cannot answer that in the context of the mayoral strategy for waste disposal. I repeat that the mayoral strategy must be within the relevant overarching national strategy. There must be a hierarchy relating to waste disposal. All local authorities and the mayor must take into consideration the matters that I have touched on. Those matters include waste minimisation and the transportation of waste to a site where it can be recycled, reused or composted.

Another part of the hierarchy relates to energy from waste disposal. The hon. Gentleman referred to incineration. Clearly, waste deposits from incinerators must be considered. There is not, by any means, only one simple solution to the problem. It would be foolish to approach a waste strategy believing that that was so. Inevitably, a combination of actions are needed to deal with waste in the United Kingdom and London, where the mayoral waste strategy will play a major part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not much the wiser. The Minister seems to be saying that a decision has not yet been made. That is fair enough. The Minister may not know the answer; I do not feel that I have had a clear response to my straightforward question about whether there will be more incineration in London than there is at present. People will continue to ask such questions so, sooner or later, the Government had better make up their mind and give an answer.

London boroughs are understandably concerned that the mayor may pass obligations on to them, without giving them extra resources to fund those obligations. In the United States, such obligations are known as unfunded mandates. Amendment No. 1057 would require the mayor to address that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give an example from my constituency. Westminster city council's waste transfer and disposal contracts run for 21 years and are worth about £116 million. If the mayor's directions force a renegotiation of waste contracts, Westminster will have to pay compensation for breaking those contracts. How will the Government approach that matter? Will the mayor, London taxpayers or central Government foot the bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's amendment relates to the cost incurred by local authorities in disposing of municipal waste. He is anxious about the eventual strategy devised by the mayor and wonders if there will be implications for boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In revising the municipal waste management strategy, the mayor will have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of implementing the strategy. When choosing a waste management option to be followed for a part of the waste stream, all authorities must be guided by the principle of using the best practicable environmental option—BPEO for short. It was defined by the royal commission on environmental pollution as a procedure that establishes for a given set of objectives the option that provides the most benefit or the least damage to the environment as a whole at acceptable cost in the long, and short, term. As it warrants repetition, I repeat: at acceptable cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly likely that any guidance issued by the Secretary of State will require the mayor to take account of costs. I trust that I have allayed the right hon. Gentleman's anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a degree. The Minister's closing words had a touch of the rhetorical about them. They were what Humpty Dumpty would have called a knock-down argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister invites us to have faith that the Secretary of State's guidance will take account of costs and it would be churlish of me not to ask leave to withdraw the amendments. The Minister's words will remain on the record and can be revisited if it subsequently transpires that what she expects to happen does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman. There is existing guidance, "Preparing and Revising Local Authority Recycling Plans and Strategies", published in March 1998. The guidance on municipal waste strategies referred to in clause 244(4)(b) will be published later this year. It puts a clear duty on authorities to consider the best practicable environmental option. In addition, the principle of using the BPEO is a central theme running through "Less Waste More Value", our consultation paper on the new national strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said, I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, what lies at the heart of my concerns is that a mayor might engage in gesture politics, obliging local authorities to take action for which he will have to carry neither the can nor the cost. However, I accept what the Minister said and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1154 in page 125, line 5, after "consult", insert—
	<br><q><p>"(aa) appropriate environmental non-governmental organisations,".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 1133, in page 125, line 13, leave out "or disposal", and insert "disposal, handling or transportation".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is yet another consultee amendment. It would add to the list of consultees for the municipal waste management strategy appropriate environmental, non-governmental organisations such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, which were referred to earlier, because they have innovative ideas to improve waste management strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1133 seeks to widen the definition in subsection (5)(e) to include bodies involved with the transportation and handling of waste. In disposing of waste, the supply chain is quite long and many different bodies could be involved. They would all have something to add to the mayor's strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have elsewhere expressed an interest in using the river to transport more waste than it does now. That is an example of how, by accepting the amendment, we could ensure that the mayor consults more people than he or she is currently required to do. I seek to leave the matter there, in the hope—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would say:
	<br><q><p>"In preparing or revising the municipal waste management strategy the Mayor shall consult"</p></q>
appropriate environmental, non-governmental organisations. Does the hon. Gentleman not owe it to the Committee to spell out which those bodies are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1496</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman's intervention, because I gave two examples. It would be left to the mayor to decide which bodies he or she thought would be appropriate. The hon. Gentleman seeks to make the Committee prescribe in much greater detail the exact bodies that should be consulted. The Government have resisted that time after time, so I shall resist his invitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to what I have said and find a way to extend the list of bodies that should be consulted by the mayor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is concerned about what he sees as inadequate requirements for consultation in the Bill on the mayoral municipal waste management strategy. Under the Bill the mayor is required to consult the Environment Agency, waste disposal authorities in and adjacent to London, local waste authorities in whose areas London waste may be disposed of, and any other bodies concerned with the recovery, treatment or disposal of waste whom the mayor thinks it appropriate to consult. In addition, as I have already told the Committee, the mayoral strategy for waste management must be within the national strategy. I touched on the hierarchy that should be considered by all local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was also anxious that the mayor should consult those whose business was the transportation or handling of waste. In the hierarchy to which I referred, after waste management come collection and transportation, reuse and recycling. That covers the hon. Gentleman's concerns about consultees who are experts in handling or transporting waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the existing consultation requirements that I have listed and my responses to the hon. Gentleman's specific concerns on this matter, clause 34 contains a list of statutory consultees for all the mayor's strategies, which includes the assembly, the functional bodies, the London boroughs and, I repeat, anyone else whom the mayor deems it appropriate to consult. It is a long list of organisations, which already allows for consultation of other bodies deemed appropriate by the mayor. Therefore, although I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns, the amendments are utterly unnecessary. Non-governmental organisations and those dealing with the handling and transport of waste, which he seeks to include, are already caught in the last category. In that light, I trust that he will withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would have preferred it if the Government had accepted our amendments and built provisions on appropriate non-governmental organisations into the Bill. However, clause 34 seems to be a catch-all and we hope that the mayor will want to consult those organisations, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Association of London Government has drawn our attention to a couple of questions and it would be a mistake to approve the clause without having inquired of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first relates to the proposed time frame for the production of the mayor's waste management strategy. No amendment on that matter has been tabled so no words are being put into the mouth of the Minister. We discussed earlier the aristocratic languor with which the review of spatial development strategy would take place. In this instance, though, we are given no guidance at all—not even the phrase "from time to time". It would be helpful to know what time frame the Government have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point may turn out to be a boomerang and reveal ignorance on my part, which should not happen to the local Member of Parliament. The ALG also noted that the clause excludes the City of London as a statutory consultee; clarification of the position would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last of the right hon. Gentleman's points, the City of London would come under the heading of boroughs for purposes relating to statutory consultees, so there will be a requirement on the mayor to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the timing of the waste management strategy, the Committee knows when the the mayor and assembly will take office, but it would be foolish to presuppose that a great deal of information about the disposal of London's waste will not be available to the mayor post the election day next May. The Bill specifies no definite time frame, but contains a power to ensure that there is no aristocratic languor in the elected mayor's delivery of a waste management strategy. The Secretary of State may direct if he or she believes that too much time is being taken to produce such a waste strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered the right hon. Gentleman's questions and that clause 244, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister expressed the hope that she had convinced me, but I have to say—with no disrespect to you, Mr. O'Hara—up to a point, Lord Copper. The hon. Lady says that I should treat the City of London as a London borough. I draw her attention to clause 241, the final clause in part VIII, which states
	<br><q><p>"For the purposes of this Part… the City of London shall be treated as if it were a London borough".</p></q>
There does not seem to be a compensating phrase at the end of part IX. It may be that, having said it once, it will do for the whole Bill but I suspect that that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1498</span>
	<p>10.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to part II and clause 34, which deals with the mayor's strategy. It states
	<br><q><p>"In preparing or revising any strategy… the mayor shall consult—
	<ol>
	<li>the Assembly,</li>
	<li>the functional bodies,</li>
	<li>each London borough council,</li>
	<li>the Common Council, and</li>
	<li>any other body or person whom he considers it appropriate to consult."</li></ol></p></q>
I trust that that answers the right hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be being exceptionally obtuse, but in that clause the Common Council is listed as the Common Council; in that respect it represents the City of London. I drew the Minister's attention to the final clause in part VIII and the fact that there does not appear to be a similar compensating item for part IX.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I clearly have taken the headline "The Mayor's strategies" in part II to mean precisely that. The right hon. Gentleman quite rightly pointed to parts VIII and IX of the Bill. I reiterate that we believe that the City of London is covered as a statutory consultee under the term "London boroughs".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This could go on indefinitely. In clause 34 the City of London is specifically referred to as the Common Council. It is not referred to as a London borough. The Minister has treated it throughout as if it were a London borough. I do not complain but I do not think, in the interests of total accuracy, that she is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly prepared to check whether I am absolutely right on this.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I rose, I saw the Minister rise too, Mr. O'Hara, so I am grateful to you for calling me. I have two observations to make about this. The first derives from the ALG's briefing which states:
	<br><q><p>"The Mayor is given the power to direct waste collection or disposal authorities to exercise, or not, a function in a specific manner. This power seems to be wide-ranging in its scope. Will boroughs have the right to appeal against a Mayoral direction—e.g. to the Secretary of State?"</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0807">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1499</span>
My second point is perhaps a more substantive one which I offer on behalf of Westminster city council. Its briefing states:
	<br><q><p>"Westminster City Council accepts that a London wide waste disposal strategy is sensible and necessary. It is possible however that directions from the Mayor in this area will lead to increased costs."</p></q>
We have already discussed that subject. The briefing continues:
	<br><q><p>"In that case we would very much welcome some clarification from the Minister as to whether the government will bear the increased cost or whether it will fall on London's council tax-payers."</p></q>
I agree that we have already debated that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document then says:
	<br><q><p>"Westminster City Council do not accept that the Mayor should be able to give directions to Councils in regard to waste collection. That is a purely local function, and is as sensitive to price increases as waste disposal."</p></q>
The council asks whether it might be sensible to
	<br><q><p>"remove the power of the Mayor to give directions to waste collection authorities."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides the necessary powers for the mayor to ensure that the municipal waste management strategy will be effective. A mayor who sets the strategic lead on difficult issues such as waste management, should have powers to ensure that the strategy's policies are given full effect. It would be undesirable if individual authorities could undermine the strategy or go against policies unilaterally. The clause will allow the mayor, when he or she considers it necessary, to issue a direction to the collection and disposal authorities either to carry out a function in a certain manner or to stop carrying it out. The mayor will be able to issue a direction only after first consulting the authority or authorities involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand fully the concerns of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. London boroughs will be concerned about the potential use of such wide-ranging power. I hope that he will accept that it is necessary to ensure that the strategy will be effective for the benefit of London as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On waste management, contracts in that sector tend to last for up to 25 years. Difficult problems might arise if a newly elected mayor with a clear mandate for a policy on waste management sought to revoke contracts that are in place. We believe in the principles of partnership, and in a framework that encourages consensual working. We are talking to the waste authorities and to the industry about the issue. We have every confidence that the waste industry will want to work in partnership with the mayor. However, we may need to consider those issues further, in the light of those discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will recognise that we take the issue seriously. We want a framework that ensures certainty and allows contracts to be entered into and maintained. Equally, we do not wish the mayor's powers to be pre-empted by the nature of the industry and by how contracts can sometimes be let. A delicate balance must be achieved, and we shall continue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1500</span>
discussions with the relevant bodies, including the London boroughs, to ensure that we have the correct framework in place to meet those objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once upon a time, I worked in the private sector for a firm that employed auditors in the dozen countries in which it operated. There was trouble between its German subsidiary and the German auditors. I remarked, after reviewing the correspondence between the auditors and my German colleagues, that it seemed that both sides of the correspondence were extremely intelligent, but that neither was bothering to read the other's letters, which were passing like ships in the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my fault that I introduced the subject of cost during the discussions on clause 244 and not during those on clause 247. I referred to the long-term nature of the contracts, and the Minister and his colleague replied to me on that subject. I accept his point—there was a meeting of minds between us. He does not seem to have responded to the point that waste collection is essentially a local matter. It is not necessarily susceptible to a Londonwide strategy, as he implied in the opening paragraph of his response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that waste collection is highly price sensitive. If he can set my mind at rest by repeating what he said about waste collection being handled within a strategy, I will shut up. In the meantime, I am sure that authorities with a wider remit than Westminster will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about waste collection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to speak now, because the last thing on earth that I want to do is to encourage the right hon. Gentleman to shut up. He has enlivened our proceedings from our first sitting, and I hope that he will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong local element in policies of waste collection. However, a waste management strategy must take account of Londonwide issues. First, a balance must be struck between the collection of waste and the different methods of disposal, including recycling, composting and other approaches. Any meaningful strategy should encourage that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to shorten the debate and to save the Minister saying things on which we already agree. We agree that we need a Londonwide strategy for waste disposal. However, I raised the issue of waste collection, and his remarks about waste disposal do not immediately respond to my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the right hon. Gentleman that collection mechanisms are affected by the policy decisions that are taken on the balance between the different methods of disposal. For example, if a strategy encourages recycling by making separate collections of certain materials, that must impact on collection arrangements and have wider implications for local policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waste transfer is another issue. Decisions are taken by individual boroughs, and the right hon. Gentleman's borough took a controversial decision a few years ago that had a dramatic effect on the amount of waste transported by road rather than by river. Such decisions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1501</span>
may put a borough into conflict with a wider Londonwide strategy of, for example, making greater use of the river for the transport of waste from the collection to the disposal point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On such matters, close discussions will be necessary between the mayor, who will represent the strategic interests of London as a whole, and the boroughs, who will remain primarily responsible for local waste collection. We do not want to create difficulties for the boroughs in the discharge of their local collection responsibilities. However, because of the wider context, it is inevitable that the mayor will have some influence. That is why he will have the power of direction given to him by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing that I did not mention in response to the right hon. Gentleman's earlier question was whether there was a right of appeal against the mayor's exercise of discretion. There is no explicit right of appeal, but any decision taken by the mayor that appeared to be inappropriate would be subject to judicial review. That is the obvious remedy for any authority that felt aggrieved. I hope that I have set the right hon. Gentleman's mind at rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the time and trouble he has devoted to seeking to set my mind at rest. I was relieved that my earlier exchange with the Minister for Transport in London after she referred to Westminster's disposal of waste meant that we did not return to the subject until the natural point on this clause. However, even that example relates to waste disposal rather than to waste collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot speak for my colleagues on the Front Bench, I hope that people outside who are interested in such matters will read the Minister's response to my specific points about waste collection. We might want to return to them on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1207, in page 127, line 39, leave out from "are" to "to" in line 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with air quality in London, and with the air quality strategy, which will contain certain information, including the
	<br><q><p>"measures which other persons or bodies are to be encouraged by the Mayor to take for the purpose of the implementation"</p></q>
of the strategy. We have heard enough of such encouraging stuff; we want some action. Our amendment would give the implementation of the strategy teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have the national air quality strategy—NAQS—in which, as the Minister knows, Westminster council is a pioneer. Nothing in the Environment Act 1995 specifically lays down the powers, but we have had roadside testing in Westminster—the first borough to introduce it—since last year. No fewer than 24 sites monitor all types of particulates and emissions, which, not surprisingly, are a problem for the city of Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the mayor to "encourage" people to do such things; they should actually happen. I could give a wide range of further examples, but in view of the lateness of the hour, I shall let my case rest having given only one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that his amendment calls for action, but I am somewhat puzzled by its contents. Surely a strategy is by definition a plan or programme for achieving a desired future outcome. If the amendment were accepted, subsection (3)(c) would require the London air quality strategy to contain information about measures that
	<br><q><p>"persons or bodies are to take for the purpose of</p></q>
implementing the strategy, rather than about measures that the mayor will encourage them to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman gave the example of Westminster. I do not mean to rub salt into the wound, but I understand that Park lane is within Westminster's boundaries, and we have already heard that that is the most polluted thoroughfare in the United Kingdom. I do not mean to criticise in any way the monitoring measures that Westminster has put in place, but the amendment tends to look backwards rather than forwards, whereas it is the future provisions for creating a London air quality strategy that will be the mayor's responsibility, and which are central to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) ensures that the mayor's air quality strategy shall include information about measures that the mayor will encourage certain bodies or persons to take. As I have said, it will not include information about measures that have already been taken. The mayoral strategy will attempt to build on measures that all London boroughs are taking on the issue at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Implementation of the London air quality strategy will be undertaken in the context of the proposals that the mayor is required to make under clause 250. Therefore,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1503</span>
and because the mayoral air quality strategy must be in line with the national one, there is little likelihood that the measures taken will be outlandish. We have already had an interesting debate on the kind of pollutants that we want removed from our air. If certain bodies or persons fail to take measures, it is not likely that the mayor will require any inducement to publicise such failures. I trust that in light of my remarks, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a minor matter, but the mayor seems likely to promote an annual Greater London powers Bill. My local authority and the Corporation of London periodically promote Bills that have to be taken through the House, so I have great sympathy for the Back Bencher responsible for taking through the mayor's Bill. It seems sensible to reserve for the mayor the right to include environmental measures in such Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regrettably, repetition will be my opening gambit. The amendments would expressly require the mayor's London air quality strategy and ambient noise strategy to contain information about future legislation that he or she may consider to be beneficial. That would underline attitudes that we have already argued or voted against on other amendments, which, like the right hon. Gentleman's, were over-prescriptive and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already ample provision under clauses 250 and 258 for the mayor to provide information about future legislation on both strategies. Clause 250 states that the London air quality strategy may contain the mayor's policies and proposals to improve air quality in London, and clause 258 states that the mayor should include
	<br><q><p>"a summary of action taken, or proposed to be taken, by the Mayor for the purpose of promoting measures to reduce ambient noise levels in"</p></q>
London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the mayor considered that a specific item of legislation would be beneficial, he or she would want to draw attention to it in the relevant strategies. However, if the mayor had no views on what future legislation might be necessary, it would be foolish for the legislation to require a section in the strategy on that subject. I trust that in the light of what I have said, the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

People who have been in the accident and emergency department of their local hospital and have seen children suffering from respiratory problems and asthma will know the importance of such a strategy. It is good that the mayor will have an input and his or her own strategy because of the particular conditions in London. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In south-west London, people are especially concerned about air quality. That is not just because of the busy roads—they exist elsewhere in London—but because of our proximity to Heathrow. Part of local communities opposition to terminal 5 has been driven by concerns about the air pollution that is caused by aircraft landing and taking off at Heathrow.

The Liberal Democrats support the clause. We hope that the mayor can be proactive in improving air quality both through the strategy in the clause and by linking it with transport and planning issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He touched on health and particularly on perceptions of how air pollution impacts on some ot the most vulnerable people in London society. He mentioned children, but there is also concern about the elderly and those who have respiratory illnesses. The issue is part and parcel of improving the quality of life in London and for Londoners, which is central to all the mayoral strategies.

	<br><q><p>"Where the Secretary of State considers that either of the conditions specified in subsection (2) below is satisfied, he may give the Mayor a direction about the content of the London air quality strategy."</p></q>
The first condition, which is not related to the second, is simply
	<br><q><p>"that the London air quality strategy or its implementation is likely to be detrimental to any area outside Greater London".</p></q>
The mayor's air quality strategy should improve air quality. How on earth can it be detrimental to any area outside Greater London? I invite the Minister to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chipping Bamet is entirely right when he refers to the twofold purpose of clause 251. First, as he said, it gives the Secretary of State powers to intervene if the London air quality strategy or its implementation is likely to be detrimental to any area outside London. That is the central situation, which the hon. Gentleman finds it difficult to imagine occurring. If, however, roads were closed in London, for example, or traffic was diverted out of London, contiguous areas could justifiably argue that the mayoral strategy had caused the quality of their air to deteriorate markedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps imposing road user charges on people coming into London would augment the level of traffic outside it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it hard to agree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood in that instance. I should have thought there that the burden of causing deteriorating air quality would be for those of us who live in London. The example that he gave was of traffic coming into London, not going out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second purpose of clause 251 is to allow the Secretary of State to intervene if a direction were required for the purposes of implementing the policies in the national air quality strategy. As we have said, and as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, all the mayoral strategies must come within the overarching national strategy on the corresponding policy area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that, in the light of my response, the hon. Member for Chipping Bamet will see the wisdom of ensuring that the clause stands part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much respect the Minister. On a slightly tangential note, I saw her on television on Sunday—she was absolutely marvellous—commenting on the sad death of Emie Wise.

Will the Minister consider whether it is absolutely necessary to include clause 251(2)(a) in the Bill? I do not need an answer to that now, but perhaps we might see an amendment on Report removing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are not proposing strategies for the immediate present, or the short or mid-term; there are long-term considerations, which must be part of any Bill. It is not beyond the wildest imaginings to conceive of a mayor who, for example, misguidedly decided that a way of developing the economic aspects of the mayoral strategies would be to site industrial complexes where their effluent or emissions could have a serious effect on contiguous areas outside the Greater London boundary. As I said, there are also considerations of transport and traffic. I therefore hope that the Committee will support clause 251.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DIRECTIONS BY THE MAYOR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 1171, in page 128, line 43, leave out from beginning to end of line 3 on page 129.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Government amendments Nos. 1172 to 1174.</p>
	<p>Government new clause 85—	<i>Directions under the Environment Act 1995.</i></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments and new clause give the mayor power to direct London local authorities in the exercise of their functions under part IV of the Environment Act 1995, which deals with air quality. They take that power of direction away from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe in more detail the powers that the changes will give to the mayor. Under amended section 85(1) of the Environment Act 1995, the mayor will become the "appropriate authority" in respect of London
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1507</span>
local authorities. That means that the mayor and not the Secretary of State will be able to direct local authorities in relation to their air quality functions under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Details about the mayor's powers of direction over London local authorities are contained in subsections (2) to (5) of section 85 of the 1995 Act. Under section 85(2), the mayor will have power to make, or to cause to be made, reviews and assessments of air quality. Local authorities in Greater London could, for example, be asked to identify where air quality standards are not likely to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsections (3) and (4) of section 85, the mayor will be able to direct London local authorities to take appropriate action if they are failing to meet air quality standards or to discharge their air quality functions under the Environment Act. He can do so if a local authority fails to take into account relevant scientific developments. The appropriate action specified in the direction could require a local authority to designate an air quality management area and to prepare an action plan for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause amends section 85 (5) to ensure that the mayor rather than the Secretary of State will be able to direct London local authorities in pursuance of implementation of the United Kingdom's international air quality obligations. That provision necessarily involves deletion of clause 255, which disapplies the Secretary of State's power of direction under section 85(5) of the Environment Act but does not give the power of direction to the mayor. We will therefore not support the inclusion of clause 255 in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two provisions will be moved from clause 253 to section 85. The first provides that the mayor may direct a local authority only after consulting it. The second ensures that in issuing directions the mayor will have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State under section 88 of the Environment Act. Such guidance includes notes on monitoring techniques and technical methodology as well as on matters such as air quality and land use planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 85(6) of the 1995 Act deals with publicity requirements in relation to directions issued under section 85. It will be amended to require the mayor to send a copy of any direction he gives to the Secretary of State under section 85. Section 85 (7) provides that local authorities will have to comply with any direction on air quality issued by the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause amends section 85 of the Environment Act to include a provision relating to section 122 of that Act, which deals with showing the European Commission that the state has implemented EU obligations. It is intended to apply only to directions issued by the Secretary of State. The amendment of section 122 is a consequential change to ensure that directions issued by the mayor under section 85 of the 1995 Act are not caught by section 122.

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Amendment No. 967, in page 130, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(d) an assessment of the impact of the implementation of the ambient noise strategy upon airport capacity at each of the non-military airports within the Greater London Authority Area.".</p></q></p>
	<p>New clause 72—	<i>Impact of ambient noise strategy on airport capacity</i>—
	<br><q><p>"In preparing the "London ambient noise strategy" assessment of the impact of implementation on airport capacity on non-military airports within the Greater London Authority Area, the mayor shall have regard to the impact on capacity at airports outside the Greater London Authority area.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We deal now with the London ambient noise strategy. Clause 258 states that the strategy should contain a number of items, to which amendment No. 967 makes additions. The clause contains the only specific mention of aviation in the entire Bill, and requires the mayor to produce a London ambient noise strategy for the purpose of promoting measures to reduce its levels. However, the effects of that are not defined. Neither the Bill nor the White Paper specifically state how the mayor's views would be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By including a requirement that the effect of the noise strategy on airport capacity be spelt out, the amendment would force the mayor to think through the aviation implications of what he proposed—an especially important requirement in view of the economic importance of Heathrow to west London, for example, and of easy access to the City's competitiveness. The amendment would oblige the mayor to assess the impact of his policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 72 would have a similar effect on airfields outside the Greater London authority area. It may appear odd to table a new clause requiring the mayor to consider the impact on airports outside the GLA area, but there is a knock-on effect, and if we are to have a joined-up transport policy, that must be taken into account. I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1509</span>
that Ministers will take seriously the widespread concern in London about noise. That has been mentioned a number of times in Committee, but this is the first time that we have been able specifically to ask what the mayor will do about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment and the new clause are extremely significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South explained, the mechanism for the mayor's implementation of the London ambient noise strategy is completely unclear in terms of aviation. This is a novel departure. Control over noise disturbance caused by aircraft has traditionally been a matter for the Civil Aviation Authority, which reports in ministerial terms to the Department of Transport and thence to Parliament. As the amendment and new clause demonstrate, regulation by the mayor may have significant effects on airports in Greater London, in the case of amendment No. 967, and outside Greater London, in the case of new clause 72.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an aggressive anti-aircraft noise strategy were to be pursued by the mayoralty, that could have an impact on the competitiveness of airports in London. It could affect the respective ability of those airports to attract traffic as opposed to airports outside Greater London, and have an impact on their competitiveness as opposed to other gateways such as Paris Charles de Gaulle, Schipol and Frankfurt Main. Far greater implications are involved in aircraft noise than the Government have realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would expect the Government at least to incorporate reserve powers for the Secretary of State to prevent a maverick mayor with an obsession about airport noise from seeking to introduce measures that would be deleterious to civil air transport and the competitiveness of the London airport system. I have grave misgivings about clause 258. I am glad that my hon. Friend's amendment has highlighted some of the provision's inadequacies with regard to aircraft noise. If amendment No. 967 and new clause 72 were to be accepted, those inadequacies would be to some extent redressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on the Minister, in responding to this short debate, to explain how the mayoral anti-noise strategy will work, what teeth it will have, what statutory mechanism will exist, if any—the clause does not make that clear—and whether exhortation or something far more prescriptive with statutory backing will be the name of the game. I ask the Minister to think again in this respect about civil air transport, which is par excellence an international industry, not a parochial issue to be addressed merely on a municipal basis. Should not the Secretary of State have powers that the clause does not currently stipulate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this hour, I accept that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood has more than adequately supported my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South in moving the amendment. There appears to be an inherent contradiction in the clause that Conservative Members are bound to emphasise. It has been drawn to our attention by the Association of London Government and London First. Subsection (2)(c) of the clause states that the strategy shall contain
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1510</span>
	<br><q><p>"a summary of action taken, or proposed to be taken, by the Mayor for the purpose of promoting measures to reduce ambient noise levels in Greater London and the impact of such noise levels on those living and working in Greater London."</p></q>
However, there is universal agreement that the mayor does not have the power to implement the strategy that he has chosen to adopt. Therefore, the summary of actions proposed to be taken is likely to be fairly modest. As I understand it—my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood knows much more about this than I do—the legislation relating to airports is national in scope and therefore it does not fall to the mayor. If we are to endorse the clause enthusiastically, perhaps the Minister will give us some clarification—quite a lot is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support new clause 72, which was tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two increasingly used airports, which are becoming international and which have an effect on my constituency, are Luton and Stansted. The planes flying to and from them have a significant impact on the noise level imposed on my constituents. By my calculation, Luton is, as the crow flies—although I have never seen a crow fly straight—only 10 miles from my constituents. New clause 72 therefore deserves the severest consideration by Ministers. The mayor should take account of flights from civil airports outside London, too. I would add that on occasion, Elstree airport, which is a minor airport used by private flights, also causes a great deal of noise in my constituency. The subject of ambient noise should be addressed taking into account situations outside Greater London, especially for sake of those living on the periphery of our great metropolis and in Northolt and Heathrow, as well as those living in the centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speeches of the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood, the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet all rightly highlighted concerns that have been and continue to be expressed on the issue of ambient noise, especially the noise created by various modes of transport; the right hon. and hon. Gentlemans talked about aircraft and airports in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seemed to be a slight misunderstanding as to the mayor's powers over the development of airports or an aviation and airport strategy. We have given a commitment to publish a White Paper on aviation and airports in a national context. As we said in relation to the mayor's functions, the mayor's strategies must come within the overarching national strategies. On the issue of ambient noise, the provisions give the mayor no powers over airport planning decisions or the noise generated by airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention, in line with our White Paper commitment, is that the mayor will have to be consulted about any changes in departure or arrival routes and airport capacity which may have significant environmental effects, and for the mayor's views to be taken into account.

Equally, the mayor will have to ensure that the mayoral strategies work together to produce the desired outcomes. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood mentioned competition. The mayor is required to ensure that the strategies work together and do not contradict each other; there must be no possibility of one strategy impeding or precluding the stated desired outcome of another strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me pose a question to test the Minister on what she has said. It is a query raised by London First. We have just discussed air quality, and my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet raised the issue of action in London affecting air quality outside. London First concluded its note on the subject by stating that it
	<br><q><p>"would welcome clarification on the approach to be taken if a conflict arose between the London ambient noise strategy and different strategic priorities relating to an area outside Greater London."</p></q>
I do not think that I detected an answer to that question in what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat surprised at the right hon. Gentleman's Question. We have made it abundantly clear with regard to all aspects of the mayoral strategy what would happen in the event of such a conflict. The example that he quoted would mean that something in the mayoral strategy was outwith the relevant national strategy or had an adverse impact on areas outside the GLA boundary. The Secretary of State would mediate in that case. Where such a deleterious effect resulted, it would be for the mayor to adapt or amend the strategy. That is true for all the strategies, that on ambient noise included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has gone some way towards answering the question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the most modest level, at this point in the Bill I am proposing an amendment to what could be characterised as a list. The Government are not normally prone to that. However, they have chosen to set out three particular sources of noise. I realise that my amendment may be an unnecessary gloss and thus otiose, but I understand, from the experience of Westminster city council's environmental protection department, that troublesome or offensive noise can stem from various and highly unpredictable sources. The amendment is intended to make it clear that the list provided by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1512</span>
Government is not exclusive. I freely acknowledge that it is not claimed to be, but I wanted to make the point that noise can be much more unpredictable than the Government have specified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 1206, which would add to the list in subsection (3)—and I agree that the Government are not prone to accepting additions to lists—
	<br><q><p>"noise from fixed non-industrial sources".</p></q>
That is the sort of noise that comes for example from putting bottles in bottle banks, which can cause considerable irritation, and which councils are bad at dealing with. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Croydon, South are undoubtedly right to say that it is the definition of ambient noise that matters. Perhaps we, as individuals, groups and a community, are becoming more sensitive to ambient noise. Undoubtedly, some noises are new; I do not remember hearing them decades ago. Clearly, such matters warrant continuous examination because noise, especially ambient noise, can cause enormous stress to individuals and groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman that we cannot accept the amendments. However, the issue that they raise is not only important but valid, and we shall therefore consider it with a view to tabling amendments, possibly, at a later stage. Other legislation would need to be considered, not least part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the provisions on noise and occupational noise in part III of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. We are cognisant of the concerns that the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman have justifiably expressed. In the light of that commitment, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, I think that that was very handsomely done and very gracious of the Minister at this time of night.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have mentioned this matter in the previous debate, but it did not relate directly to either aviation or non-industrial noise. I want to ask two questions. What powers will the mayor have to reduce road traffic noise, where it is identified as a problem? I am thinking of the A40, about which I have spoken to the Minister, in my constituency and those of other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several proposed rail freight projects will affect many Areas of London, especially my constituency and those of other members of the Committee. What powers will the mayor have to influence those planning decisions? Even if the projects are outside the authority, will the mayor be able to make a strong case on behalf of the people of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a brief welcome to the ambient noise strategy. Liberal Democrat Members hope that such a strategy will give added protection to those suffering as a result of aircraft noise in south-west London and other parts of the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey told me how many complaints about aircraft noise he gets from his constituents. That emphasises the importance of the strategy, which we welcome in the hope that it will effectively reduce aircraft noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek to stir up controversy with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton at this late hour, but I am pessimistic about clause 258, and doubt whether it will be worth a row of beans. I doubt the usefulness of the clause, given the lack of mayoral powers to implement it. Once the Committee stage is over, I shall re-read everything that the Minister has said about how the strategies fit together like a jigsaw. Her responses tend towards tautology in explaining that all will be well on the night. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton increased my apprehension that Londoners will have heightened expectations that the mayor can do some good in this respect, but I am not confident that he will. The office of mayor will be somewhat demeaned and diminished because Londoners will feel that he has not delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we retired from the Committee to attend the call of the Bell, the hon. Member for Uxbridge had raised the issue of road traffic noise. He will be aware that the Bill requires the mayor to consider road traffic noise when creating the noise strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was also concerned about the increased movement of freight on the railways of London as it affects his constituents. He will remember our discussions on surface rail and the mayor's powers. Clearly, the mayor has a right to be consulted and to be listened to. However, the mayor may not introduce any measure that is outwith the national strategy, nor any measure that would have a deleterious effect outwith the GLA boundaries. Considerations will be presented to the mayor upon which he or she will make the relevant representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I was not present in the Committee when the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster made his speech. I was surprised at the accusation of tautology; I would never base anything that I said on the misapprehension that it will be all right on the night. I have spent too many nights when that cliché has failed to deliver ever to rely on its rosy, impermanent glow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised in the light of my earlier remarks, at the right hon. Gentleman's discounting of the powers of the mayor and the mayor's clear requirement to deliver outcomes. Nowhere will that be more important than in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1514</span>
the noise strategy. It is unlikely that someone who will be given the powers and duties of the mayor by the people of London will be of a character who would enter into such a contest without it being clearly in his mind what he wished to deliver. He would also be clear about the promises that he would make to the people of London to ensure that delivery would not be the disappointment that the right hon. Gentleman wants us to believe it will be.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, even by my standards. My question is how the air quality strategy will link with the transport strategy. I could have raised the issue under clauses 250 to 257, but it seemed neater to do so in this clause. In the light of my earlier remarks, it would be inhumane of me to press for an answer in Committee, but I would enjoy it if the Minister would write to me after the event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 259 is a short clause, consisting of only two lines that state:
	<br><q><p>"In exercising any function, each of the functional bodies shall have regard to the strategies prepared and published by the Mayor under this Part.</p></q>
That clearly imposes an obligation on Transport for London, which is one of the functional bodies, to have regard to those strategies, which would include the ambient noise strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the air quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And, indeed, the other environmental strategies, but in particular the noise strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all part of our attempt to ensure consistency in the Bill and to ensure that the mayor and the mayor's executive agencies adopt a holistic approach towards the fulfilment of their responsibilities. At the risk of incurring the displeasure of Opposition Members, I point out that it is a further example of joined-up government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sour grapes would be no justification for an intervention that might keep the Committee up later than otherwise. I make no complaint about the discrimination exercised by our wise Chairmen in not choosing amendment No. 546 in my name or amendment No. 1196 in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull, but the mayor's obligation to look after the ecology and environment of London is one of the foremost challenges—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I point out to the hon. Gentleman that amendment No. 546 was debated with amendment No. 543.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. O'Hara. The obligation to look after the ecology of London is of such importance that I should have thought that the Government would welcome an approach that involved people fully at a local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 243, which provides for the London biodiversity action plan, places an obligation on the mayoralty to consult important relevant quangos, such as the Nature Conservancy Council, the Countryside Commission and the Environment Agency and to have regard to biodiversity plans produced by the boroughs or to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. For the strategy to be successful, people with a genuine knowledge, on a professional or gifted amateur basis, must be involved. That is why the idea of an ecology committee has merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may think that an ecology committee is now superfluous, but I hope that they will think again. The involvement of such admirable bodies as the wildlife trusts for Greater London, Hertfordshire and Middlesex or the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds could only do good. They would be working with the mayoralty, instead of policies being imposed, in which they feel they are not involved and about which there has been little consultation. That is why I ask the Government to consider the matter again and perhaps to come back on Report and suggest that the ecology committee—[	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is one line longer than the last clause that we debated. It contains three lines, as opposed to two for clause 259. Clause 260 would abolish the London ecology committee with effect from the coming into force of the Greater London authority. We have already debated the reason for that: the mayor will have specific responsibilities for ecology and the staff of the London Ecology Unit will work for him or her. There is no question but that the mayor will want to have a constructive relationship with other bodies in the Greater London area concerned for ecological matters, as described by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1516</span>
hope that I can put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. In no way is this a backward step; it is a forward step. A wide range of bodies will have continued involvement, but there will be a powerful agency in the form of the mayor, who will have the executive ability to achieve forward-looking policies that advance the interests of biodiversity and ecology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the London Ecology Committee in recent years. It has made a considerable contribution and ensured that issues that might not otherwise have received sufficient attention have been seriously considered. There is no question but that there is now a far greater awareness in London of the importance of such issues than there was in 1972, when the committee was established under provisions of sections 101 and 102 of the Local Government Act 1972. That has a proud record and it is right for us to pay tribute to it tonight as we pass the clause that will ultimately abolish it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In his response to the stand part debate on clause 259, the Minister talked about the Government's aim to ensure consistency, coherence and joined-up government for London through the Bill. New clause 83 is intended to help the Government's intentions by ensuring that local authorities in Greater London shall have regard to the strategies prepared and published by the mayor.

We moved the new clause because the White Paper suggests that the mayor might deal with the water issues.

The plan should be published speedily because of the importance in London of water, the Thames, increasing domestic water consumption, and decreasing industrial consumption. The water table in London is rising as a result of the latter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Water quality is affected by the rising water table, the usage of brown-field sites and general pollution, for which the mayor should have monitoring and action-taking responsibility. Levels should be monitored so that usage can be controlled, particularly in times of drought, so that wastage can be prevented when there is heavy rainfall.

Reservoir supply is largely from outside London. A drought in other areas may have a knock-on effect. The plan would allow for the planning of water availability.

During the many long hours in which I have sat in the Committee Room, my mind has turned to natural disaster. The rising water table presents the increased risk that our noble capital city may one day—perhaps soon—be underwater. Lewisham may be a lake, Paddington a pool and Lambeth a lagoon. I am thinking of when a great, green, greasy Limpopo sweeps down the Bayswater road and when the mighty Brent becomes a veritable Zambezi, debauching at Brentford. In such a

London, in the pellucid pool that was once Paddington, the sibilant, silent salmon swims, perhaps accompanied by the frisky haddock.

As we consider whether I got all the words in, I should say that the hon. "and gallant" Member for Croydon, South made points to which the Government should give their attention. Let us not forget that being a city underwater might have advantages for London. Certainly, there would advantages be for the magnificent haddock. Those of us who have read the famous book, "After London", by Richard Jefferies, author of "Amaryllis at the Fair", will know that it posits a post-disaster London in which the pavements are cracked by growing grasses and Nelson's column topples in the centre of the city. People should realise that disaster is approaching—the water is rising and the ice caps are melting. I freely admit that that is the fault of the previous Government, but the facts remain. If we are to legislate for the many and not for the few who have submarines, there must be an end to boom and bust, and we should grapple with the concepts involved.

I hope that Labour Members will not be put off by the fact that the new clause originated with the hon. "and gallant" Member for Croydon, South. He spoke about issues that are of concern to all of us Londoners who cannot swim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government will not accept the new clause, although we believe that the issues mentioned by the hon. Member for Croydon, South and by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North have considerable relevance. Clearly, water quality and the protection of London from rising ground water are important. I am pleased to say that only last week I launched the new general aquifer research, development and investment team strategy. It is designed to ensure that action will be taken to stabilise water levels under London, through the abstraction of water from new boreholes being sunk in various parts of London by Thames Water. The threat of rising ground water should therefore not be a serious problem to Londoners.

The Government's main difficulty with the new clause is that it creates a hugely onerous responsibility. It lists a detailed series of obligations, many of which duplicate existing obligations imposed on the Environment Agency. It does not seek to transfer powers from the Environment Agency to the mayor, but merely creates a raft of additional responsibilities that would mean extra bureaucracy and tiers of government, all of which Opposition Members denounce. On this occasion, I have considerable sympathy with their denunciations. I wish that they would denounce the new clause and accept that the GLA' s role is to be strategic. The mayor will have the power to intervene where necessary in the same way that the Government intervened on the issue of rising ground water to bring all the parties together to ensure a satisfactory outcome. We believe that the mayor has

sufficient powers under the Bill to do that without duplicating the powers of other agencies, specifically the Environment Agency. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the new clause is not appropriate and should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
