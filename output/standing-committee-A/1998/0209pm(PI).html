	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 122, in page 29, leave out lines 23 to 36—	<i>[Mr. Forth.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: Government amendment No. 248.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 204, in page 29, line 25, leave out "ten" and insert "two".</p>
	<p>No. 281, in page 29, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1 A) Each member of the Assembly may appoint political advisers or other members of staff, subject to any regulations laid down by the Assembly.".</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 123, in page 29, Line 37, leave out "under subsection (1) above".</p>
	<p>I seek to be as helpful to the Committee as I can. It is my intention that we adjourn for a dinner break and other purposes at 7 o'clock for one and a half hours. I am led to believe that the Government may require the Committee to return after the 10 o'clock vote or votes. I give notice, if it has not already been given by one of my co-chairmen, that if there is a Division we shall break for 15 minutes, or for the full half hour of there are two divisions.</p>
	<p>Bearing in mind that many important matters that we shall be considering a little further on in the Bill, particularly those relating to finance, I hope that Committee members will use their discretion in respect of their interventions as well as the length of their speeches on certain parts of the Bill which they may not consider to be as important as other parts. Perhaps I go further than I should in saying that, but I seek to give a guide to the Committee to ensure proper and full debate on all important matters of principle and substance.</p>
	<p>4.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London(Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was previously responding to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), which would allow assembly members to appoint political advisers. As I pointed out, the mayor and not the assembly will be the political pivot round which the authority turns. The assembly will not be an alternative political
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
administration and will not be there to put forward an alternative political agenda to replace that of the mayor. It will be there to test and challenge the mayor's proposals and strategies, where it finds them to be at fault, to scrutinise their implementation and to examine the other actions of the mayor and his or her agents. With the exception of the 12 appointments that we were discussing earlier, the assembly will appoint all the authority's staff, including the chief administrative officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 61 applies the provisions of section 4 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to the chief adminstrative officer as head of paid services. That Act requires the head of paid service—that is, the GLA's chief administrative officer—to prepare a report setting out his or her proposals for the manner in which the Authority's different functions are to be co-ordinated, the number and different grades of staff required by the authority for the discharge of its functions, the organisation of those staff, and their appointment and proper management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in our view inevitable that in fulfilling that duty, the chief administrative officer must provide the assembly with adequate administration and staff resources. That provisions will most probably take the form of a secretariat dedicated to the service of assembly members and drawn from GLA staff, not unlike the private officers that service Ministers of the Clerks of the House who serve its Committees. Of course, members of the Assembly will also be able to call on the services of all GLA staff, other than those in the mayor's office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 248 clarifies the type of appointment that the mayor will make to his or her office under clause 56(1). The current wording of subsection (l)(b) suggests that the mayor's appointments will be short term, to deal with issues as they arise, but that is not its intention. The mayor may, for example, choose to appoint a chief of staff to his or her office, who might remain with the mayor for the duration of his or her term of office—as might any of those appointed to the mayor's office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, I hope that the Committee accepts the Government amendments and that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) withdraws his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given the Committee an unusually detailed and exhaustive—if not exhausting—explanation of the Government's position. I suspect that that indicates a certain vulnerability on her part. However, I accept that there is an unbridgeable gulf between the Government's attitude and that of myself and, I suspect, my hon. Friends. In the light of your guidance a few moments ago, Mr. Winterton, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment so that the Committee may make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 248, in page 29, line 25, leave out from "than" to end of line 26 and insert
	<br><q><p>"ten other members of staff.".—[Ms Glenda Jackson.]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I thought that I had still to seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 204.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That amendment is not formally before the Committee, and is therefore not available for a vote even if the hon. Gentleman were to want one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 29, line 32, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(2A) In making appointments the Mayor and Assembly shall as far as practicable secure that the staff of the Authority are representative of London's diverse population.".</p></q>
This is a probing amendment which is high on optimism and short on pragmatism. No member of the Committee can ignore the fact that 25 per cent, of London's population is of ethnic origin. If one takes into account those who are from eastern Europe, the proportion rises to 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a briefing note from the excellent Organisation Operation Black Vote, which includes a number of startling statistics. For example, only 16 per cent, of black youths between the ages of 18 to 25 said that they voted in the 1997 general election, while 96 per cent, of the same group stated that they would vote if there were something or someone to vote for. Five of the country's poorest boroughs are in the capital. All bar Islington—that is, Hackney, Newham, Southwark and Tower Hamlets—have populations that are more than 40 per cent, black. There are many more statistics in a similar vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the authority recognises London's deep ethnic diversity and the contribution that that makes to the city's cosmopolitan society. I tabled the amendment to highlight that point and to probe the Government's thinking about the city's ethnic make-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the amendment's objectives. London is full of diverse talents represented by people of all sorts of backgrounds and origins. We wish the London authority to recruit strictly on the grounds of merit, which extends throughout every type, kind and condition of person within the city. If anything were to be done to appoint people on ethnic grounds by virtue of overt discrimination, that would be counter-productive and unnecessary: it would discredit the authority from the outset. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) has clearly expressed Conservative Members' commitment to the fullest possible representation of London's populace on the authority's staff in positions of authority, trust and responsibility. The mayor should know that talent should be used to the full, but that positive discrimination on ethnic or other grounds is rightly objectionable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am uneasy about the proposed approach. I am always unhappy at attempts to introduce into a body or institution and its recruitments and appointments a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
spurious representativeness. I am doubly suspicious if the basis of that representativeness is some sort of ethnicity, if only because that word has become so abused and distorted as to be almost meaningless. Are not we all ethnic, in one way or another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should concentrate on the words in the amendment, rather than on those used by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. The amendment proposes representation of the "diverse population". Representativeness of diversity could presumably involve different occupations or origins. For example, I could argue that many people of Scots origin live in London and that they must, in fairness, be represented. It might be interesting for the Committee to consider whether I could qualify as ethnic on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must address the chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have so frightened me, Mr. Winterton, that I have completely forgotten what I was going to say. I shall say something else, and speak slowly enough to remember. Does my right hon. Friend know whether there will be sufficient representation of bald people with glasses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) makes a different point. I am attempting to make my point with the seriousness that it deserves. If hon. Members are to consider the proposed approach, we must try to understand what it is all about. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South stressed something called ethnicity, a word that risks being patronising and arbitrary. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) suggested, it could have perverse effects unless we are careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment itself, however, uses the word "diverse", and proposes to honour diversity through representation in appointments. We should be aware that diversity can be interpreted in a number of different ways. What about religion, for example? Forget ethnicity and colour of people's skins—what about a bit of religious representation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, Mr. Hoddle asked interesting questions about the role of religion and religious beliefs and about our degree of tolerance to them. Perhaps appointments should take account of religious representation, while we are at it. What about people from the London boroughs? I would argue that people from the outer London boroughs should be represented fully in appointments to the staff of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adopting such an approach could get us into a ghastly mess. I accept that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said the amendment was a probing amendment, and I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments. I confess, however, that I am reluctant to give my support to such a measure, because it could at best cause counter claims about representation and at worst lead to more conflicts and more identification of people's differences and similarities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I humbly suggest that it is for the electorate to decide the background of their assembly members, but it is not for the mayor and assembly to make staff appointments on any grounds other than merit? People of exceptional merit are the rarest in society, and they are not representative of the diverse population as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to end my remarks by echoing my hon. Friend's sentiments. Londoners' interests will be best served if all appointments are made on the basis of ability and merit rather than on that of some sort of representation of a diverse population. The Committee should keep that in mind, and I hope that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, is regarded as a probing amendment and that it is left at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke: (Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said that this was a probing amendment and I want to add a further probe. I might have left the matter to the clause stand part debate, but you might have thought that we did not need one, Mr. Winterton. I therefore want to raise the matter now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The title of the clause is "Appointment". The first set of amendments was really about non-appointment. With the present group, I can at least hook my queries to the appointments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding, which is not universally shared outside the House, is that the procedure for the appointment of the 10 advisers in question will be carried out under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. It is a tribute to Lord Nolan—similar to that paid to Mr. Samuel Plimsoll, whose name has passed into our language—that we now refer to Nolan principles as if we all knew exactly what they were. I am not confident that I know exactly what they are. I am not sure whether they apply primarily to procedure or to the spirit in which the choice of appointments should be made. It is clear that the world now looks to appointments under Nolan principles or procedures as the good housekeeping seal of approval. I would, therefore, be grateful if the Minister could confirm whether the Local Government and Housing Act lives up in every way to the conditions that Lord Nolan set—obviously much more recently than 1989, which was the year of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave pacing notice of my other concern. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm whether the clauses that we are discussing will be the bedrock for the appointment of all other mayors in future. If so, the clauses become, by definition, all the more important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment touches on a theme that we have discussed several times—the role that the authority will play in promoting good relations between all of London's diverse communities. The whole Committee agreed that fostering tolerance and understanding was an important role for the mayor and the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible for me to accept the amendment for two reasons, however. Essentially—although I would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
use different vocabulary—they are the reasons that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst gave. What constitutes a "diverse population"? It is unclear what constitutes London's diverse population. The right hon. Gentleman has already touched on the possibility of interpreting that phrase in an infinite number of ways. He touched on religious beliefs, but we could mention ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, social background, wealth and political affiliation. By what criteria would the authority be judged when making its appointments if the amendment were accepted and passed into law? How would we define the concept of diversity by which appointments would have to be made? What would be the means of redress if the authority failed to live up to the terms of the amendment? Those are real challenges to—if the hon. Member for Croydon, South will forgive me—such loosely worded proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the basic principle of appointment on merit. Clause 56 treats the GLA as a local authority for the purposes of section 7 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster Mr. Brooke said. The Act states that every appointment of a person to a paid office or employment under a local authority shall be made on merit. As I said during a previous debate, clause 265 treats the GLA as a local authority for the purposes of section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976. Section 71 states:
	<br><q><p>"it shall be the duty of every local authority to make appropriate arrangements with a view to securing that their various functions are carried out with due regard to the need—
	<ol>
	<li>to eliminate unlawful racial discriminaton; and</li>
	<li>to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups."</li></ol></p></q>
I argue that that clearly covers the intent of the amendment tabled by the hon. member for Croydon, South. However, I do not believe that it would be correct to include his proposal in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, from his intervention, it appears that the hon. Member for Solihull has much to learn about political correctness. Surely what he is, is follically challenged. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was going to refer to bald women with glasses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This short debate has been illuminating and helpful. I accept fully the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I am also very grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster for the points that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So my remarks were too trivial! 	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had dealt with those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that what I am trying to achieve in relation to selection on merit and recognition of the diverse ethnicity of London is already in legislation. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INVESTIGATION OF AUTHORITY BY COMMISSION FOR LOCAL ADMINISTRATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I have one point to raise concerning the title. The clause is perfectly logical if we accept the Government's proposition that London government, is local government. The clause will give power to the Commissioner for Local Administration to investigate questions of maladministration by the GLA. If we accept the Government's proposition, that is fine. However, the time may have come for the Government—the Ministers Department and other Departments—to reflect on whether the titles for the ombudsman service are still correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have three types of ombudsman: the health service commissioner, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration—as it happens, they are the same person, but they are two separate posts—and the Commissioner for Local Administration. Even before the clause is enacted, we have already extended the powers of the ombudsman to consider matters that are clearly not part of local government. For example, the ombudsman's office considers complaints against the Environment Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not ask for an alteration here and now, because we clearly have to start from where we are. However, I hope that Ministers will pass on my request—which I shall also pursue through other means—that we consider redesignating the functions of the Commissioner for Local Administration, so that his job is restricted to local administration, and creating a commissioner for administration, if we are increasingly to assign to an ombudsman other jobs, such as monitoring Government agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an entirely logical position to take if one takes a gender-neutral view of the English language.

To return to what I asked, will the Government consider—not in the Bill, but sooner rather than later—defining correctly which ombudsman does what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), we are happy to consider what he has said.

They recognise that ombudsmen are a port of resort outside the defined areas of deemed responsibility in local and central Government. I am willing to consider what the hon. Gentleman said, but I cannot give him any real hope that a change in the title would be meaningful. As I said, people are clear about what the title "ombudsman" means.

It was interesting that the hon. Member for Solihull proposed the concept of an ombudsperson. When his hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw attention to the fact that the Scotland Act 1998 covers financial provisions only briefly, in part III, which contains just nine sections—sections 64 to 72. By contrast, the Greater London Authority Bill contains detailed financial regulations in 55 clauses—from clause 67 to clause 121 inclusive. There must be a reason why the Greater London authority is thought to require seven times as many clauses as Scotland to corral and restrict its financial arrangements. For all we know, Scotland may soon be an independent country. I do not require a response, but as we consider those 55 clauses that thought will continue to be in my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 379, in page 35, line 36, leave out from "shall", to end of line 37 and insert—
	<br><q><p>"(a) make the calculations required by this section and such calculations shall be made in conjunction,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) have regard to achieving economies of scale and efficiency when formulating the constituent budget.".</p></q>
My concern is that at an early stage in our consideration of the authority's financial provisions we should impress on those who will be carrying them out that planning needs to be a coherent process and that instead of dealing with a series of matters on a one-off basis, the relationship of one to another should be realised early on. My amendment would provide a means by which that should be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause sets out how the GLA will calculate its component and consolidated budget requirements. The budget requirement for each of the constituent bodies is calculated separately and these are then aggregated to provide the consolidated budget requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that when setting its budget, each constituent body considers carefully the services that it will be providing. The functional bodies have very different responsibilities. Requiring them to produce budgets in conjunction may add an unnecessarily time-consuming task to the procedure. Even the smallest of the constituent bodies—the authority—will have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
budget that is larger than a significant number of existing authorities. The larger functional bodies will be well capable of achieving economies of scale and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority will be able to take an overview of the work of the four functional bodies and to consider where it is appropriate for them to combine efforts to achieve the GLA's goals. However, a requirement to produce budgets in conjunction might simply add to the amount of administrative effort that is needed to produce budgets for such large organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that we are talking about bodies such as Transport for London, which will be larger and more comprehensive than London Transport, and the Metropolitan police authority, which has responsibility for policing. Such large organisations have exceedingly large budgets. Considerable administrative effort would be needed to ensure that all those budgets were calculated simultaneously. We do not believe that that is a cost-effective or sensible way in which to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also point out that clause 71 ensures that any amounts that appear in the budget of one of the component bodies should not appear in that of another. That is a safeguard to ensure that there is no duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I remind the Committee that the GLA and each functional body will be under the duty of best value, as are other local authorities. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the first to acknowledge that I tabled the amendment in the spirit, rather than the letter, of a particular conduct of policy. I have no difficulty in absorbing the Minister's response. However, I should like to illustrate briefly the sort of consideration I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rare that an individual Minister has the chance to make a saving contribution to public expenditure. When I was the relevant Minister, however, I was presented at about 2 o'clock in the morning with a request for me to sanction expenditure of well in excess of £1 million to enable polytechnics—as they then were—to establish an admissions system similar to that used by the universities. As the universities admissions service had the name UCCA, it was likely that that of the polytechnics would be called PUCCA. The document reached me at 2 o'clock in the morning, but I was required to sign it before breakfast so that the policy could be implemented. There was no requirement for the PUCCA computer system to be compatible with that of UCCA. If polytechnics were turned into universities and it became desirable to marry the system, two incompatible systems could therefore have been brought forward. I remember minuting on the top of page, "I am perfectly happy to sanction this expenditure, provided that I receive a guarantee that the computer systems will be compatible." That had not received prior consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am arguing for such concerns about expenditure on the scale in question to be taken account of in policy conducted by the authority. I am entirely content not to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 393, in page 36, leave out lines 38 to 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 388, in page 36, line 40, leave out from "above" to end of line and insert—

	<br><q><p>(b) the absolute amount so calculated shall be payable from the constituent body to the Authority."</p></q>
No. 350, in page 36, line 40, leave out "nil" and insert "the resultant negative amount."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats believe that subsections (6) and (7) contain problems. Amendments Nos. 393 and 388 seek to rectify those problems, and propose two ways of doing so. Either subsection (7) could be deleted, which is our preference, or it could be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems relate to the asymmetric treatment the potential surpluses or deficits of a constituent body. The Bill provides that if spending exceeds own resources, a constituent body can look to the GLA to fund the difference and make up the deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a constituent body were spending less than its resources, however, the CLA would not receive the surplus back. That is where the asymmetry lies. Why are not any of the unrequired receipts of constituent bodies paid back into the central pot?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering the provisions, we wondered whether the Government were keen to create an incentive for efficiency by allowing a constituent body to keep savings if it made efficiency gains. The Bill shows that that cannot be the case. Under paragraphs (b) (c) and (d) of subsection (4), any such savings would go into the accumulated reserves and be counted for next year, so no incentive is created. In estimating the average amounts in subsections (4) and (5), the authority could anticipate such efficiency gains. There is no reason why such an incentive should be installed in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions may be intended as another control mechanism. We have seen many of those. They may be intended to guarantee a ring fencing to ensure that funds not required by a constituent body are not used by the GLA for another purpose. The Government clearly do not want that to happen, and this may be yet another mechanism to stop the GLA operating autonomously in managing its finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the reason for the apparent asymmetry, Liberal Democrat Members are against it, and we believe that a better alternative exists, especially as set out in amendment No. 388. Surely it would be better for such money to be paid back to the GLA, which could then use the funds either to reduce the council tax precept for the whole of London, thus reducing the tax burden, or as expenditure for one of the other constituent bodies. Such an approach would give more freedom and autonomy to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
the GLA, and would create an incentive for it to assist the constituent bodies in being more efficient. If the GLA could help Transport for London—or whatever other body—to read the economies of scale about which the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster spoke, it would create money that it could use to reduce council tax or to increase expenditure elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not seek to blow away the rather complicated component budget-making process that the clause sets out. It would, however, introduce some logic into the clause, and thereby ensure that the GLA had a modicum of financial autonomy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members support the sentiment behind the Liberal Democrat amendment. It would be similar in its effect to our amendment, the purpose of which is to enable council tax payers to derive the benefit if revenue exceeds expenditure. The clause could, in certain circumstances, give rise to a negative amount as a result of the calculations. The negative amount calculated would then, in effect, be written off as the only possible amount to be stated other than a positive one: that is, nil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the word "nil" in that situation does not allow for any negative requirement to be reported. The result of not reporting-that is, writing off—a negative requirement would be that the funds to which it relates are not available for use in any other manner. Funds would thus, in effect, be lost to London's taxpayers. The Minister shakes his head; I am delighted about that, as it perhaps indicates that he will be able to accept the amendment. The amendment would allow for the reporting of a negative requirement and the subsequent redistribution of the relevant funds for the benefit of London's taxpayers. If the Minister were to accept the amendment, a consequential amendment—amendment No 351—would be needed to clause 73.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to achieve two ends—first, to allow the functional bodies to have negative budget requirements and, secondly, to require the functional bodies to pay any amounts calculated as negative budget requirements to the GLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two objections to the amendments. First, they seek to change some key aspects of local government finance arrangements and to substitute very different arrangements for the GLA. Liberal Democrat Members have spent most of their time in Committee arguing the merits of the framework of local government and denouncing central Government, so it is surprising that they now seem to be seeking to rewrite local government financial rules. Secondly, the measure is completely unnecessary. It would provide for an eventuality that is unlikely to arise in any foreseeable circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local government finance system does not provide for negative budget requirements for local authorities. We do not intend to change that for the budget requirements of the GLA's functional bodies. Local authorities whose income exceeds their expenditure do not have to give away their income to other bodies. Instead, they consider how best it can be used to improve the services that they provide. The same principle applies
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
to the GLA and its functional bodies. I cannot envisage circumstances in which the mayor would set a negative budget requirement for any of the functional bodies. The idea of the Metropolitan police having a negative budget requirement exemplifies the absurdity of that concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, ruling out negative budgets does not mean ruling out flexibility. The Bill provides a mechanism by which any spare resources can be redistributed from one body to another. Clause 105 allows any of the bodies, with the mayor's consent, to pay revenue grant to another functional body, and clause 104 makes similar provisions for grants for capital spending. That mechanism for ensuring that resources are used efficiently across the GLA and its functional bodies is much more appropriate than a rigid system of negative budget requirements. For those reasons, I ask the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two reasons that the Minister gave for opposing the amendments were not entirely convincing. He suggested that Liberal Democrats do not want to change local government financial arrangements. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, during an earlier sitting, I said that we want to overturn and radically reform local government financial arrangements. We find the way that the Government control local government's autonomy over its budget-making processes to be offensive. That argument, therefore, will cut no ice with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second argument was that our amendments were unnecessary and unlikely. If that is the case, why does he find them so objectionable? They are sensible amendments which would ensure that if money was not spent, it would automatically go back to the central exchequer of the authority and be recycled, either to reduce taxes or to be spent more effectively elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like to return to the issue later. Although we do not intend to press the amendment at this stage, we were not convinced by the Government's arguments. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 380, in page 36, line 46, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(10) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, the precept issued by the Authority for any financial year ("the relevant financial year") subsequent to the first financial year for which the Authority issued a precept shall not exceed the precept issued in the financial year preceding the relevant financial year by a percentage greater than the percentage by which the Retail Price Index increased in the year to September preceding the relevant financial year.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(11) In the case of the component budget devoted to the Greater London Authority's own costs, the calculation shall show that the proportion taken by precept shall not exceed the amount of three pence for any Band D council tax payer in any billing authority in the first financial year of existence of the Greater London Authority, or, in succeeding financial years, the same amount adjusted for the Retail Price Index in conformity with subsection (10) above.".</p></q>
The amendment comes in two distinct parts. The purpose of the first part, proposed subsection (10), is to limit increases in the GLA precept to RPI to the increase of the previous December. The Government express the intention that the new authority should not represent an oppressive financial burden on Londoners. On a national
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
level, the Government set great store by their adherence to inflation targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience of powerful precepting authorities elsewhere in the country shows that they can be far too willing to impose their will on lower tier authorities to exact high and rapidly growing precepts. As this is a Bill for London, and as we who serve on this Committee are predominantly London Members, we are unfamiliar with that experience. If members of the Committee were over the border in Surrey, Kent or Hampshire, they would know only too well the feeling that the districts have as the counties press down on them with high financial demands, with the district council having to take the political flak, being the body that presents the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the eyes of the taxpayer, the blame for excessive increases in tax demands lies with the billing authority. Many London boroughs will recall the animosity towards them generated by the former Greater London council's precept demands. The chance of that occurring again is particularly iniquitous for those boroughs that have successfully fought to control their spending while providing high-quality services. It is also unfair on the electors in those boroughs, who have supported prudent administration. I refer to boroughs such as Wandsworth, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Bexley, Hillingdon—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bromley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, we are not in control of Bromley now. It is a profligate organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Financial discipline is not imposed on the GLA by the terms of part III of the Bill. This is a new type of authority and the dangers of excess are plain. The Government's stated intention is that the authority should be financially responsible. If that is to be anything more than a pious hope, limiting the increase and its precept for each financial year to RPI is not only desirable but an indispensable protection for the people of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of amendment No. 380 would limit the running costs of the Greater London authority to 3p per band D taxpayer and adjust it only by inflation thereafter. We are against London taxpayers having to pay more for their council tax to fund the London assembly and mayor. The Secretary of State, the Deputy Prime Minister, said in column 628 of 	<i>Hansard</i> on 14 December 1998 that the grant would add about 3p extra per week on a band D council tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a warning of bad things to come. In 1996, the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan)—whose attention I have failed to attract—said when she was asked how the GLA would be funded:
	<br><q><p>"any financial effects of a new authority on London Boroughs would be implemented by means of the usual local government financial arrangments i.e. through adjustments to the Standard Spending Assessments and not through making a contribution."</p></q>
That statement was made when the hon. Lady was chairman of the policy and resources committee of the London borough of Barnet. It is similar to remarks that have been made by senior Labour councillors and leaders of Labour groups the length and breadth of London. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
has occurred in my borough of Croydon. The impression was given to the electorate before the general election that the new authority would incur no cost to council tax payers.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party in London put across a spurious message in the general election campaign to the effect that there would be no additional cost, no precept—that is what we heard. Now we discover that there most definitely will be, and to his credit my hon. Friend is insisting that it should be no more than 3p for the band D council tax payer—the median council tax payer. Furthermore, he requires any increases to be no higher than the retail prices index. That may not appear important now, when inflation is relatively low. However, I remember—as will you, Mr. Winterton—what happened when the metropolitan district councils were imposed. In my part of the West Riding, as it then was, West Yorkshire metropolitan district council was superimposed and there was a precept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was hard enough to bear, but there was a further consequence of the superimposition of a superior authority, as will be the case here in London: a haemorrhage of skilled and qualified personnel from borough staff, who will seek to advance their careers—if they can, by selection and on grounds of merit—by securing a post on the staff of the Greater London authority. In so doing, they will secure better salaries. That is how it worked with the metropolitan district councils; I forecast that exactly that will happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, there will be a built-in tendency for the budget of the authority to escalate faster than the rise in prices, unless there is a specific measure to contain that process; unless it is stipulated clearly in statute from the outset that the precept shall be no higher than 3p for the band D council tax payer. I hope that not only the Committee but the voters of London will take note of my hon. Friend's important amendment, because it shows that the Conservative party wants the authority to give best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to speak to the amendment because it reveals a variance between London Conservative policy and national Conservative policy on the issue of capping. The amendment is just another form of capping on the Greater London authority on top of the two forms of capping that the Government will introduce in the Local Government Bill. Under that Bill, an authority will be subject to two regimes of capping: Prescott sophisticated

capping, as it is now generally called, and the council tax benefit subsidy limitation. These devices are cleverly designed to impose serious pressures on local authorities to contain their expenditure. They also deny those authorities, including the GLA, financial autonomy and the accountability to the electorate that is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to this stage of our deliberations, there has been a degree of concord between ourselves and the Conservatives about the mayor and assembly being properly accountable to Londoners and not to the Secretary of State. We are therefore surprised that the Conservatives have tabled an amendment that would do just what they have thus far condemned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should I conclude that the hon. Gentleman would be happy if the word of the Deputy Prime Minister was broken and the cost of the authority was greater than 3p a week to band D council tax payers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key point is who decides the levels of council tax, spending and costs, and how the authority runs, and the accountability for that should be transparent to Londoners. If Londoners want to vote for an administration and a mayor that offer them a higher council tax, they should be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would deny Londoners choice on their services and on how things should go forward. It would blur the question of accountability, which we have been concerned to make clear in the Bill. It is incredible that the Conservatives have tabled an amendment that would introduce the principle of capping, even though they are likely to support an amendment that would oppose that principle in another Committee in the near future. The Conservative party needs to be clear on where it stands on capping—is it for or against?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that the economic background has shifted dramatically since the general election? During the election campaign, the financing of the GLA was not spelt out. Londoners were told neither that they would have to pay a tax if they drove into work, nor that their employers would have to pay a tax when they parked on arrival. Londoners will face a tremendous burden of additional taxation at a time when the country is entering recession—we have seen the official figures for manufacturing. We are beholden as custodians of the public purse to ensure from the outset that the authority does not get out of financial control and impose further financial burdens on Londoners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments reveal the confusion at the heart of that part of Conservative policy. Policy is shifting, and far too quickly for the Conservative Members who tabled the amendment. In another Committee, the Conservative party's position on capping is changing. However, in the amendment, Conservative Members stick to the position that they held when in government. Their party's policy has shifted too quickly for Conservative members on the Committee to keep up with it. If we are to have a genuinely accountable assembly and mayor, they must be liberated from central restrictions. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
A final point concerns best value, which we did not have the opportunity to discuss during the debate on another amendment. The subject has been raised by the Minister and others during this debate. Undoubtedly, we need a regime that would allow best value to be achieved. Whether that regime is the one being legislated for is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be interested to know whether the running costs of the assembly and mayor will be subject to best value, as the Bill that introduces the regime of best value specifically refers to functional bodies. Does the assembly—and the services that it will receive—therefore become a functional body for that purpose? Will the Minister clarify whether the services provided directly to the assembly, such as the secretariat, will be subject to best value? If not, will there be a need for subsequent amendments to enable them to be so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Almost from the start of this saga, we have been told that the new body will not be like the Greater London council. Ministers claim, "It is not going to be anything like the GLC. Don't worry, it won't repeat the nonsense of the GLC." However, at the same time, Ministers and their supporters were saying that it was shocking and dreadful that the GLC had been abolished. They did not seem able to make up their minds whether they liked the GLC and were horrified when it was abolished, or whether they did not like the GLC and wanted to reassure us that the GLA would be nothing like it. Perhaps the amendment will give Ministers an opportunity to tell us which of those views they really hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with Ministers' reassurances, we have heard such terms as streamlined authority and low-cost authority. One could therefore imagine a modest body with no staff, hidden away somewhere in modest buildings doing good works and without being too obvious to anyone. I do not believe that that will be the case, and I doubt whether many people who have taken the trouble to follow these proceedings believe it either. Some of the clauses that we considered earlier have shown a risk that the authority will be, like most political bodies, a spending machine. It is almost encouraged to be so, because some of the clauses give nods and winks to the mayor and assembly persons that they will be able to have loads of staff, advisers and all sorts of other people before they even get started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore believe, with some reluctance, that we must give a counter-signal to such thinking. We want to believe what Ministers have said. They say, "Don't worry, chaps and chapesses, this authority will be streamlined and low-cost and won't be too much of a burden on you." The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South provides the opportunity to put those words into effect. It is a test of the Government's true intentions and of what they really think that the authority will be like. We shall therefore be interested in what Ministers say, and if they adopt the suggestions in my hon. Friend's amendment, we might be reassured. If they do not, it will give a warning signal to us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman a simple question. Whatever the type of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
authority, does he not trust the electors to make a choice as to whether they want to pay more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that someone would ask me that question, as it allows me to say a word about capping, to which the hon. Gentleman refers. My view has always been that if the circumstances should ever exist where each local authority taxed its residents and voters, and paid for all its services from that revenue, capping could be abolished. There would be true accountability for the spending—taxation and representation would be in harmony. However, we are not in that position, because taxpayers generally pay the bulk of local authorities' expenditure through the Exchequer. There is therefore, regrettably, no direct link between voting and spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Come the day—and I wish it were soon—when we had transparency and when each local authority had to be accountable for what it did by taxing its residents and then spending accordingly, we could do away with what has come to be known as capping. Until that day comes, I regret that something like capping—in other words, central Government taking responsibility for the money that they disburse to local authorities—may have to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a logic to the right hon. Gentleman's argument. Some of us would wish to go, like him, in a direction where more revenue was raised locally and less given by the taxpayer. However, that does not win the argument for him. Provided that electors have it made clear to them which money comes from where, and what services are paid for by which authority, they can still see whether the Tories spend less, the Liberal Democrats a bit more, or Labour much more. They would still be able to see that. Why will the right hon. Gentleman not let them have the choice even if it is not the full choice that he wants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the elected representatives are spending someone else's money. It does not matter what their manifesto or programme said, the reality is that once the free-spending Liberal Democrats have been elected they say to the electorate, "Look, we will spend lots of money on wonderful services." Most of the money that they spend belongs to the hapless taxpayer in general, rather than to the council tax payers who elected them. In my view, there is not the necessary connection between taxation and accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will respond carefully and fully to the questions raised by the important amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. Perhaps, for the first time, we will see the Government's true intent, so that during the rest of the Committee's proceedings, we, along with people outside the House of Commons, can judge that intent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would restrict increases in the Greater London authority's precept to the same rate as the annual increases in the retail prices index. It would also restrict the cost of the budget for the GLA, in its first year, to 3p a year for a band D council tax payer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities must set their budget requirement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
and their council tax taking into account their responsibilities to the electorate, and the resources—including grants from central Government—that are available to them. We do not restrict local authorities to fixed increases each year, as we recognise that they face different circumstances and require flexibility to decide how much they need to raise from council taxes. The Opposition, when they were in government, did not impose a blanket restriction on council tax increases related to the RPI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, as promised in our manifesto, we have removed crude and universal capping. Local authorities will no longer be able to use their capping limit as their budget requirement, and will have to take more responsibility for deciding their budget. That is part of our policy of increasing local financial accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are retaining reserve powers that will allow us to protect council tax payers from excessive demands. We hope and expect that we will not have to use those powers against any authority, including the GLA. Nevertheless, the powers are there and if we have to use them, we will. That will apply to the GLA as much as to any other authority. If necessary, we will be able to use the reserve powers to protect London's council tax payers from excessive increases. There is, therefore, no need to treat the GLA differently from any other local authority and to restrict the precept to annual increases in the RPI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper made it clear that London council tax payers will contribute a small amount to the costs of the new mayor and the assembly. We estimated that contribution to be about 3p a week on a band D council tax bill. I will not attempt to address the suggestion in the amendment that Londoners should pay only 3p a year. That is manifestly preposterous. I will not focus on the other technical defects in the amendment. I will simply repeat the assurance that the Government have given on many occasions, that Londoners will contribute about 3p a week on a band D council tax bill to pay for the mayor and the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what Londoners voted for in the referendum last year. We made our position and the estimate clear before that referendum, and the allegations that the Government duped the electorate are preposterous. In the referendum the people voted in favour of our proposition by a large majority and that is the amount that will be included when we set the GLA's budget for its first year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the light-hearted way in which the Minister treats my cock-up in the drafting of the amendment—it was meant to read 3p a week. He rightly says that that sum was an election pledge; indeed, it was repeated by the Deputy Prime Minister on the Floor of the House. If we were to table an amendment to correct the error, would he accept it and incorporate into the legislation the pledge given by the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the Committee the same pledge that the Government have given on many occasions. We intend to honour it. I can assure him that the amendment is not necessary because in the first year of the GLA, the authority's budget will, by necessity, be set by the Government, as the GLA will come into

existence after the start of the financial year. I have given that undertaking and that is what we will deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Gentleman that his amendment is linked to an RPI formula that does not apply anywhere else in local government, and which would be entirely inappropriate. Therefore we could not conceivably accept an amendment along those lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) that best value will apply not only to the functional bodies but to the GLA itself, including all the staff who serve the mayor and the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will write to me about that. There was some confusion in the Committee considering the Local Government Bill about the way in which best value is defined in authorities. I read the transcript, and the matter was still not clear to me, so I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify it, and possibly direct us to the relevant legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily write to the hon. Gentleman, but I repeat the assurance that the principle of best value will apply to the functional bodies and to the Greater London authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked about the Greater London council. I put it on the record for the last time—we have said it many times but clearly it has not yet penetrated—that we objected strongly to the arbitrary way in which the GLC was abolished by the previous Government. That does not mean that we believe that the GLC was a perfect body incapable of reform. We are creating a new structure of government for London, and we are creating one that is appropriate to the 21st century and is very different from the GLC. That shows that we are looking forwards, not backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered all the points that have been made, and I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply do not believe that it would have been possible to have reformed the old GLC, by amendment, as it were, into the structure that he proposes today; he would have had to scrap it and start again, and that would have been the right course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that he cannot accept our amendment, which partly aims to link precepts to the RPI, because as such matters are not done that way in local government they should not be done that way in the authority. For the past three or four weeks, I have been sitting in Committee listening to the Minister saying, "This is a new body. The old rules do not apply. It is a new form of government. We're trying to do something different here."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The modest suggestion that a precept should not go up by more than inflation, that the cost of fire services in London should not go up by more than inflation, has caused this complete about-face.

They are whacking up council taxes all over the country, almost as high as in some of the most outrageous Labour councils. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made a most appalling speech. It all shows that the Liberal Democrats are responsible for the highest spending in local government, and that they are by far the most left-wing party in British politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that it is so important that increases in the precept should be related to the RPI, will he tell the Committee why his Government introduced no such index in their 18 years in office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had to listen to the Labour party bleating about Conservative capping for 18 years. Now the Minister says that he could not possibly support our amendment. Is that what his intervention means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises the red herring of capping. I made it clear that we have changed the crude capping framework, which provided a disincentive for authorities to take responsibility for their own budgets. We are encouraging them to take full responsibility for their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our point, which the hon. Gentleman is trying to avoid, is that the amendment would impose a requirement that any increase in council tax—a precept in the case of the GLA—should be limited to the RPI. Why, when his party was in government, did it not impose any such requirement on precepts, council taxes or any other form of local government expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comes from a member of a party that went into the general election campaign pledging to abolish capping. Capping was clear and everyone could understand it, but the Government got rid of it and replaced it with another form of capping, the rules of which no one has any idea about. The Minister asked why the Conservatives did not do the same in our 18 years in office, but the Labour Government abandoned their pledges of 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Finally, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that our amendment blurred accountability.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for having been out when my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South moved the previous amendment. I have to move the first motion on the Floor of the House tomorrow and I was taking a briefing from somebody who was still in his office. I have a couple of questions, which go back to an amendment that I tabled on clause 70 and on which it would be helpful to have a definitive statement from the Government before we take the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, my amendment related to the preparation of budgets in conjunction. Will the separate budgets that make up the total budget and thus the GLA precept be published separately? Secondly, to revert to an exchange that I had with the Minister earlier. I think that I am right in assuming that the advice that the mayor receives on the GLA budget will not be open to cross-examination. Will that also apply to those who advise on and prepare the budgets for the functional bodies, which will make up the GLA precept? Will they be protected because those budgets subsequently form part of the GLA precept? For the reasons that we discussed this morning, it is important that we have clarity on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The approach that the Liberal Democrats take when considering the devolution of financial powers is that one of the guiding principles should be that any council or assembly should have freedom within its total budget to choose between priorities. The clause will remove that freedom from the CLA because of the way in which the component parts are put together to form the consolidated budget. That is why we oppose the whole process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give financial autonomy to an institution we should reduce the use of ring fencing to a minimum and keep it out wherever possible. That is not to say that there is occasionally a case for ring fencing, and such a case can be made in the Bill in respect of the transport grant. Transport for London will act as a quasi-commercial body. It will need to compete and to make commercial productivity improvements. There is a strong case for its grant to be ring-fenced and considered separately. We cannot, however, see why the other budgets for which the clause makes provision should be decided separately. We are talking about five separate calculations to make one budget. We want completely the reverse approach. There should be one initial decision about the budget, the council tax levies and so on. Those moneys should then be allocated between the constituent budgets. That approach would increase the GLA's financial autonomy and its ability to deliver on Londoners' wishes. We are, therefore, very much against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked two specific questions, the first of which related to the separate budgets, which will be publicly visible as such although they will come together in the consolidated budget, which will form the basis for the authority's budget for the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's second question related to advice to the mayor on the GLA budget. In line with my comments this morning, the advice to the mayor will be private; it will not be published and members of the assembly will not be able to demand it. The background

papers will all be published. This morning, I mentioned the need for an amendment, because while that is clear in relation to the staff of the authority, it is not clear in relation to the staff working for the functional bodies. The amendment's purpose will be to make it clear that the same Whitehall principle of confidentiality and accountability through Ministers—in this case the mayor—will apply to the functional bodies as well as to the staff of the authority. I thought that it would be helpful to the right hon. Gentleman to put that on record.

The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam does not like that policy. He would undoubtedly like a framework in which the Greater London authority would be able to have its own foreign policy, to raise money on every subject under the sun and to spend profligately, financing a number of absurd Liberal Democrat wheezes. The Government do not intend to adopt that approach. We want a prudent, properly run and efficient Organisation that responds to the principles of best value. That is exactly what the clause delivers. I urge hon. Members to support the clause, which should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State has to seek the agreement of members of the assembly before getting involved with jiggery-pokery in its financial calculations. It is similar to the other amendments, which refer to clauses 73, 200 and 201. Those amendments are also intended to curb the ubiquitous and omnipotent presence of the Secretary of State in the financial calculations of the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to alter any aspect of calculations made by the authority. It also goes beyond that; he is able to alter the rules that govern those calculations. Those powers are very intrusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 73 provides powers for the Secretary of State to revisit the way in which calculations are made to set the basic amount of tax. Clauses 200 and 201, which relate to congestion charges and parking levies, again give the Secretary of State complete powers to dictate how those new revenue sources are to be set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such centralist fanaticism of the Government in trying to organise the assembly's financial arrangements is a familiar theme. The approach has been noticed by commentators outside the House. Simon Jenkins wrote in 	<i>The Times</i> after Second Reading that the new mayor of London is to be little more than the Treasury's tax collector. That is a telling point, which suggests that we are going through this entire process merely to create a new tax collector. Simon Jenkins goes on to suggest that clauses 70 and 77 of the Bill "empower" the Secretary of state "to control London's finances." We agree: that is why we tabled the amendments. Mr. Jenkins states that the Secretary of State
	<br><q><p>"is not obliged to take any notice of Londoners' votes. As for the new London assembly, it has all the powers of an old Russian soviet."</p></q>
Trying to explain why such dictatorial powers are being taken by the Government, he writes:
	<br><q><p>"They have gazed into the future, seen Red Ken, and decided to abolish the new government of London before even setting it up."</p></q>
That is what these powers will do. They will not give real authority and autonomy to the assembly. We have returned to this theme time and time again, and make no apology for doing so. It is important that we try, whenever we can, to democratise the assembly so that the people of London have a say and the finances for London's functions are not governed by Stalinist powers in the hands of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As happens so often in Committee, Liberal Members have wound their weary way on to a rather important matter—although one might not have thought so in listening to them expound their arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 would affect the Secretary of State's power to issue regulations. Regulations can be fairly extreme: they have, ipso facto, to be obeyed, especially when they are issued by the Secretary of State. The alteration of a constituent body's budget is a draconian and savage intrusion into the authority's autonomy, and I understand Liberal Members' desire that the scrutinising body—that is, the assembly—should be able to prevent such regulation by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
a majority vote. However, in practical terms, they are whistling in the wind. That is a familiar activity for the Liberals, comparable to their whistling the polls up in advance of an election. It would be inappropriate for the assembly to prevent a regulation made by a Minister of the Crown. Parliament may do so, certainly, but not assembly members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 61 is similarly concerned with the process by which the Secretary of State could interfere with the formula. If the letters were to be jumbled around—they are Roman letters, not Greek, so we do not need my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster to tell us what they mean—I, for one, should not be able to judge what the difference in outcome would be. The Secretary of State, in his omniscient wisdom, would of course be able to do so. The provision represents a major power of interference and intrusion but, again, a majority veto exercised by the assembly would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can appreciate that the authority may not, in the Secretary of State's judgment, be spending enough in terms of the national interest on fire and civil defence, on the police, or on some other activity that requires more attention than it is being given by the mayoralty. I can understand the jiggery-pokery, to use the colourful language of the Liberal Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 66 and 68 relate to hypothetical taxes—imposts which may not be levied because the Labour party may cry off applying them. There may be such an outcry between now and the authority election next May that the Government think better of it—they may judge it unwise, if not to frighten the horses, to scare the voters. After all, no one would wish to do that in the pre-election period, would they?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are hypothetical taxes, but I comprehend strongly the motivation behind the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats. Such imposts, undesirable as they may be, should be applied for the betterment of London's transport. However, after that magical 10-year period, the Government may decide, under these powers, to use the moneys for something else such as building up their consolidated fund—the usual euphemism for the bottomless pit of Government expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These important themes go to the heart of the relationship between central Government and the authority. We are talking about the assembly's power to control budgetary matters as opposed to the necessity—in some instances, and for understandable national reasons—for the Secretary of State to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall await the Minister's response with great interest. I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench can give me guidance. If the elucidation that we receive from the Government Benches is not adequate, I hope that we shall have an opportunity to return to these issues, which are of the greatest importance in terms of constitutional and budgetary control matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood was extremely complimentary to the Liberal Democrat Members for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
tabling the amendments. My view is the slightly less charitable one that, in this imperfect world, there was always the possibility that common sense and the Liberal Democrat party would occasionally coincide. I am glad that they did so on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me reinforce my hon. Friend's comments, in a brief construction. We know that the Secretary of State gives a general grant, and we know that there is a reserve power to set minimum levels for the Metropolitan police authority's budget, which is then refunded in the GLA's precept. There is considerable scope, which has already been alluded to, for intervening in and disrupting the setting of the GLA budget by the Government, quite apart from the Secretary of State's power to implement Government policies with funding from London taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reasonable for us to ask the Government how much scope they identify—and, indeed, anticipate—that the Secretary of State will have in setting the budgets of the functional bodies and the other budgets. The critical issue for London voters is that the system should be transparent. The critical issue is that the GLA should not have an alibi because everything has been so totally confused and mucked up by Government intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision for the GLA to take responsibility in future for activities currently undertaken by other best-value authorities, such as local authorities, is something that we should debate later. You would not wish me to dwell on that subject now, Mr. Winterton. However, we shall need to know in what circumstances the GLA will be allowed to take over such functions. For exactly the same reason, there is the potential for confusion and lack of transparency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In light of the series of questions posed by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, and given what I thought was an overly charitable interpretation from the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood of the purpose and intent of amendments tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, it might be helpful if I began by explaining why the powers that are referred to in the Bill are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power in clause 71 is needed so that the Secretary of State can include or exclude certain items from the budget requirement. The budget requirement is used in the tax-setting equation to determine the amount of revenue that the GLA will need to raise from council tax after deducting revenue support grant, non-domestic rate and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power in clause 73 is needed so that the Secretary of State can alter the rules governing the calculations for the basic amount of council tax to accommodate the introduction of new grants, or changes to the powers under which grants specified in clause 73 may be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in clauses 200 and 201 are needed to provide the mayor and boroughs with powers for road user charging and a workplace parking levy. Government amendments will remove the reference in clauses 200 and 201 to the Secretary of State making regulations. The revised clauses will assign the charging powers directly to the mayor and boroughs. That is the purpose of the provisions.

I said that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was being overly charitable in his interpretation of the purpose of the Liberal Democrat amendments because the Liberal Democrats are using the Committee as a quest, and the holy grail that they are pursuing is the powers which at present reside with the people of London. They are attempting with every single amendment to deny the will of the people of London as clearly expressed in the referendum, in which the people voted overwhelmingly for a strong mayor, for the power to be in the office of mayor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just let me finish. The people of London voted for the powers of the assembly to be to scrutinised. The Liberal Democrats want to deny the power of the people of London after the election for mayor and assembly by subverting—overturning—the balance of power. For the second time today, their attack has been on the power of the people of London, by whom they are returned to this place. They have virtually said that the paramount power of the House of Commons should be overturned by the GLA assembly. I thought that we had already established that the only body that has the power to scrutinise the Government, in the form of the Secretary of State, is the Chamber of the House of Commons, not the assembly of the GLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders will of course be dealt with in Committee, not on the Floor of the House. Is the Minister's argument that the Secretary of State is somehow uniquely blessed in his ability—or, in future, her ability—to be able to determine the views of Londoners and then impose them on the GLA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the Secretary of State is indeed blessed, because the Secretary of State of whichever Government is here only by the will of the people. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are consistently attempting to undermine, deny, denigrate and treat with contempt the will of the people of London with respect to the setting up of the GLA and the powers inherent in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the fact that the Minister is getting carried away with her own rhetoric to counter an argument that some of us have not made, will she answer a simple question? Is it the view of the Labour Government in 1999 that the people of London should have the power to decide how much London Government spends, or should that be decided by central Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say that there is never any danger of anyone being carried away by the rhetoric of the hon. Member for Southward, North and Bermondsey. As my hon. Friend the Minister for London has pointed out, we believe in giving powers to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A little bit of power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all; the hon. Gentleman misinterprets his own party's amendments. They have nothing to do with increasing the powers of the people of London; they actually and actively attack the will of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
people of London as expressed in the referendum, as will be expressed in the GLA elections and as has been expressed with regard to the powers of this Parliament. I therefore ask the hon Member for Kingston and Surbiton to withdraw his amendment. If he does not, I ask the Committee to negative it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the Minister, it appears that the world has turned upside down; logic has been turned on its head. The idea that people vote for the Secretary of State is clearly nonsense. They will vote for the assembly; they will vote for the mayor. The amendments seek to take power from the Secretary of State, who is not voted for by the people of London, and give it to members of the assembly. That is about democracy, which the hon. Lady mentioned. Although the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster made some ungracious comments, they were approaching our position. However, when they heard the word "democracy" and saw an amendment about giving communities freedom to decide their futures, even they, like the Government, moved away. They were scared by the prospect of empowering people. I and my hon. Friends will continue to argue our case because we believe passionately in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that the amendments were benign and that they were about enabling the Secretary of State to make changes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Malign, not benign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's clarification. What she actually said was that the clause and the relevant section were benign. If the clause is so benign—if it is about the Secretary of State providing more money or helping the assembly—it would make perfect sense to allow the assembly members to vote on such matters. If it is so benign, assembly members will have no problem with it and voting will lead to a process of democratisation as regards Secretary of State's decision.

and insert
	<br><q><p>"the information required to be presented by sub-paragraph (3)(a) above.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are minor amendments to the procedure for determining the authority's consolidated budget requirement. We will make other comments about it in relation to other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the present amendments is to increase the amount of information that is available when the budget is set. They would promote greater transparency and accountability in setting the budget. They would also promote greater financial accountability on the part of the GLA by requiring increased disclosure from the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to provide financial details will enable a comparison to be drawn with previous years. Leaving aside disclosure of the overall consolidated budget figure, financial data on each body's actual expenditure and the grants received will give a clearer and more balanced analysis of the financial situation. The final item relates to the level of financial reserves and would provide a clear indication of the authority's indebtedness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 356 and 357, which are listed later, are so closely tied to these amendments that if you will grant me the indulgence of three sentences, Mr. Winterton, the Committee will not have to discuss them later. They refer to the publication arrangements of the relevant information. Amendments Nos. 355 and 356 propose that the mayor's discretion on publication arrangements should be removed, and amendment No. 357 proposes a one-week limit for publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister realises that the amendments have been tabled with the intention of improving accountability and allowing comparisons with the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman claimed that the amendments are designed to increase accountability. However, they would do little to increase accountability and a lot to increase the volume of paperwork. The budget, which involves considerable responsibilities for four functional bodies and a wide remit covering a large area of public administration, will be substantial. It is therefore right and proper that it should be presented in a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
way that allows thorough scrutiny and appropriate comparisons with previous years, and other useful comparators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendments are neither necessary nor helpful in that way. They would require the mayor to provide specific financial information covering the three previous years when presenting the first consolidated budget to the assembly. That would restrict the mayor and prevent him or her from publishing the budget in the most appropriate manner. It is unnecessary to be so specific. When the mayor presents his draft budget, he or she should be able to decide how best to present the information. Assembly members will be able to ask for as much additional data as they wish, and will be able to secure it—even if the mayor does not provide it—through the officers of the Greater London authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No similar requirement is placed on other local authorities to produce their budgets in a specific way that presents three previous years' information. The previous Government did not impose that obligation on local authorities, and it is therefore curious that Conservative Members now seek to impose it on the GLA. When a draft budget is discussed by a local authority before it is approved, the Government do not prescribe the information that should be provided to council members: that is for the local authority to decide. There is no reason to be more prescriptive in the case of the GLA and, accordingly, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has touching faith in the future mayor's ability, intention and/or desire to increase the amount of information that is available. He said that that would create an unnecessary level of paperwork. I must point out to him that democracy sometimes requires such things. Some form of comparison is essential: it is not a good enough excuse to say that it will cost money or clog up the system. However, there are many other more worthy issues on which to divide the Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 394, in page 154, line 11, leave out "1st February" and insert "15th January".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 396, in page 156, leave out lines 10 to 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed primarily to give the assembly more time to debate the draft budget, and thereby enable wider public consultation about whether the mayor has got it right. The amendment would move back the publication date of the draft budget to 15 January. As the Bill stands, the assembly will have four weeks between the publication of the draft and final budgets. We propose a six-week period. Clearly, there is a judgment to be made on the practicalities. Given that amendment No. 395 requires the assembly to consult widely on the formal budget when it is proposed by the mayor, ensuring that the practicalities are considered and the consultation process genuine would require a longer period between draft and final budgets.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only argument against moving the date back to 15 January would be if it created a problem for the mayor in drawing up his budget. Presumably, the Secretary of State will announce the provisional grant settlement at more or less the same time as announcing the provisional grant settlement for local authorities—in late November. That would give the mayor and his staff, working with the constituent bodies, about six weeks to draw up the draft budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is actually better than that. We are all familiar with the processes in local government when preparations are made for the provisional grant settlement statement by the Secretary of State. An awful lot of work is done prior to that, starting in the summer months. Scenarios are put forward and officers are asked to consider various options. That process produces a series of ideas and strategies—at least, it should in a well-run authority—about what sort of shape the draft budget is likely to take when it is put to the full council or, in this case, the full assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor will be in an even better position than the local authority. He will have a large, well-trained staff; he will be working with constituent bodies, such as Transport for London, which presumably have a well-trained, well-resourced finance department. The six-week period that our amendment would allow the mayor in which to draw up a draft budget is, in our view, ample time. The amendment would also allow better scrutiny and greater consultation on the draft budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, in many ways, a probing amendment. However, we ask the Government to look seriously at giving the assembly more time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly reasonable point in seeking to extend the period for consultation. However, I think that he recognises that there is a difficulty in matching the timetable to the timetable for the announcement of the local government settlement. He outlined that timetable, and we have no plans to depart from the current framework. Within that framework, the provisional settlement is usually announced around the beginning of December. From that point on, the mayor will have to prepare a draft budget and consult with the assembly. That is an obligation for consultation during the preparation of the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have chosen the beginning of February as the date for the mayor to present his first draft budget to coincide with the publication of the final settlement. We believe that it is right that when serious consideration of the budget begins, there should be some certainty about the overall financial settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within the current local government settlement system, there is the opportunity for local authorities to make representations to the Minister. Are we to expect that only the mayor, who will be producing the draft budget, will be able to make representations, because the assembly will not at that stage have formally considered the draft budget? How can the mayor and the assembly work together to make representations to the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>402</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will, we hope, have understood from the Bill, it is the mayor who proposes the budget and who is the executive, and who will therefore be responsible for making representations to the Government about the provisional settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Minister would be unwilling to accept representations in a delegation from the assembly to make further points on the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot imagine that the Minister would. Ministers spend an inordinate amount of time in late December and January meeting delegations from local authorities. Many come to make serious points, while others come simply because they believe that it is appropriate to make their case and that they will be less well treated than others if they do not. That is, of course, not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no suggestion that representatives of the assembly will not be entitled to accompany the mayor if that is felt to be an appropriate solution. The mayor, as the executive, is, however, responsible for taking the decisions. During the relevant period, there will be consultation between the mayor and the assembly about the framework for the budget. That is necessary and is required by the Bill. The mayor will then present the draft budget at the beginning of February. As I said, that will allow consideration of the budget to be carried out with an element of certainty about how the final local government settlement will impact on the GLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable is tight and the process has to conclude by the end of February. That is a good compromise, which enables proper discussion. It will also enable minds to be concentrated to produce what I hope will be a satisfactory outcome by the end of February, when a budget must be set. The procedures make it it impossible for a budget not to be set. The budget will be either the mayor's budget or the assembly's budget, depending on the outcome of the discussions and votes in the assembly at the two stages. Either way, a budget will be determined by the end of February, which will allow the precepts to be required from local authorities in London. The timetable is tight, but achievable. It allows discussion, and there will be plenty of opportunity for consultation with the assembly before the formal process begins. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the Minister responded, particularly to the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam. That was most welcome. I was not quite convinced that the date needed to be 1 February to coincide with the final announcement of the settlement. The draft budget could be brought forward to begin the consultation process. We do not, however, seek to divide the Committee on the point. I beg to ask leave to Withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes a small but important change to the procedures that the mayor and assembly will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
follow in deciding the GLA's budget. As drafted, schedule 5 gives the assembly power to set the GLA's budget by a simple majority if the mayor fails to present it with his draft budget on or before 1 Februay or with his final budget before the last day of February. Amendment No. 301 converts that power into a duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The roles of the mayor and assembly in setting the GLA's budget are set out in detail in schedule 5. I explained the principles when I responded to the previous amendment. The procedure is designed to give the Mayor and the Assembly an appropriate role in the important processes before us and to prevent deadlock. The amendment is needed to ensure that circumstances do not arise in which there is no effective duty to set the GLA's budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 395, in page 154, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1A) The Assembly shall take such measures as it considers necessary to consult Londoners on the draft consolidated budget prior to its consideration by the Assembly.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(1B) The consultation arrangements referred to in subsection (IA) above may include surveys, opinion polls, public hearings, citizens' juries and referenda.".</p></q>
We welcome the Government's approach in those aspects of the schedule that seek consultation between the mayor, the assembly and other bodies. That is a welcome step. The Government could, however, he braver and go further. The budget will be one of the new authority's significant roles. The amendment would ensure that the requirement for consultation went wider and involved the ordinary Londoner, if there is such a person—as we know, all Londoners are special.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not propose the amendment in a prescriptive way. We suggest possible consultation arrangements, which are very much in line with the Government's thinking in the White Paper on local government. We believe—as the Government appear to believe elsewhere—that such consultation with a wider public strengthens the resulting budget. The public might come up with ideas that politicians have not thought of. They would also understand the budget-making process, which would enhance the authority's standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is therefore an attempt to help the Government do what they say they want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton—majority of 56—said sounds very sweet and light and I would go along with it to some extent. However, I part company with him because the way in which the mayor or the assembly decide to consult the public is none of his business. This is a profoundly anti-democratic provision to impose on the mayor and the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait a while. I have listened to your incessant wittering for hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and in all political parties should show courtesy to each other, and I hope that they will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suitably admonished, Mr. Winterton. I shall go and look up the word "courtesy"—because I clearly need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a step too far. It is statutory diktat. We heard lots of free and easy talk from the Liberals and other airy-fairy nonsense ad nauseam, as though this were a fourth-form debating society—I say that in the most courteous way that I can. But to suggest to the democratically elected mayor and the assembly the very ways in which arrangements for such consultation on the budget should be made is wrong and profoundly anti-democratic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be having problems not only with the word "courtesy" but also with the word "may". If he read the amendment instead of reacting in his typically kneejerk way, he would see that it is not prescriptive. It offers options, but does not require them to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, the key phrase in terms of anti-democratic diktat is the "shall" in proposed subsection (1A), not the subsequent "may" in his little list of suggested ways of consultation. Many Labour councils throughout the land consult fully in the ways that are suggested in proposed subsection (1B).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the simple fact is that it is not the House's business to suggest through the Bill to democratically elected politicians throughout London how they should or should not consult. If they are found wanting in the way in which they consult on the budget or any other aspect of their work, it is for the London electorate to kick them out the next time round for being so secretive and anti-democratic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman therefore explain why in an earlier clause stand part debate he voted for consultation with business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of that was in terms of the strategies that the mayor and assembly must pursue—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Please do not be childish, even at this late hour.

<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
We required serious consultation, to an extent among the public and certainly with interested bodies, and the hon. Gentleman supported that. We may return to such provisions in terms of the voluntary sector and others. That is entirely right and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the importance of the budget, I hope that the assembly goes in this direction, but I repeat that it is not for the House to be so prescriptive as the first part of the amendment suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam in the spirit in which he moved the amendment—quickly and, I hope, succinctly and helpfully. We will not accept the amendment, because we believe that it is unnecessary and unduly restrictive, although it would not prevent the consultation that we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is full of provisions for consultation. We believe that the authority should be a genuinely open and consultative body. The Committee discussed consultation under clauses 25 and 34. I have undertaken to come back to the Committee with further thoughts about how we can best meet the obligations that they set out. As the Government mentioned in response to an earlier group of amendments relating to consultation, the Bill contains provision for consultation during the process of budget making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) made a valid point. The amendment is unduly restrictive in requiring the assembly to follow specific consultation procedures in relation to the budget while not imposing on the mayor obligations to consult. That seems rather curious, as the mayor will initiate the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it will be difficult to meet the obligations of a full consultation within the tight time scale for consideration, bearing in mind that from the publication of the draft budget at the beginning of February there is one month only—and a short month of 28 days at that—to complete the assembly's consideration of the draft. That will be the time allowed for the preparation of a revised mayoral budget if the assembly does not accept the first draft and for the assembly's consideration of the second mayoral draft. To add a complex series of
	<br><q><p>"surveys, opinion polls, public hearings, citizens' juries"</p></q>
and so on would not be feasible. Even worse, it might risk legal challenge, if a member of the public were to feel aggrieved because such things had not happened. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who said that that part of the amendment does not use the word "shall", but there is nevertheless the option for a member of the public to see the reference as an obligation that has not been adequately met, and for that person to seek to frustrate the process with litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Bill contains adequate provision for consultation, much of which will begin before the formal stage of the presentation of the first draft budget by the mayor at the beginning of February. Experience of mayoral systems elsewhere shows that preparation of the budget is a focus for considerable public debate. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
mayor and assembly are likely to participate in various initiatives, some relating to the press and media and others to public meetings, in order to explain their position if they are engaged in debate about that budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton does not need to have any fear about consultation. It will happen, but I believe that his proposals are inappropriate, for the reasons that I have given. I urge him to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for replying in his usual courteous manner. He was doing well in trying to persuade me of the strength of his case until he referred to his hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East. The amendment is in no way prescriptive, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. He referred to the word "shall", which is contained in proposed subsection (1A). If he had read the sentence fully, he would have seen the words "as it considers necessary"—not as we, the Committee or the House consider necessary, but as the assembly considers necessary. That does not sound terribly prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to say that he has responded positively in previous debates on consultation, that the Government will table amendments and that they will consider how provision for consultation on other aspects of the assembly and of the mayor's work can be increased in the Bill. In the light of that positive approach, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Croydon, South has asked for his apologies for not being present for some of the sitting to be given to the Committee. To my surprise, and I suspect to the surprise of the Committee, he has asked me to move the amendment in his place
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the privilege for nearly nine years to come to Committees such as this in a somewhat different
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
capacity, and to have thrust into my hand copious notes, answers to questions, the lines to take, and all the other things that that privileged position gives one. For nearly two years now, I have had the joy of coming to Committees without anything in my hand whatever, and members of the Committee know the result of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am now back in the position of having had some notes put in my hand. It may be that my brief remarks in moving the amendment in the name of my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull might make more sense than what I have been saying in Committee until now—that is for hon. Members to judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of amendments is important with regard to the budgetary process. We are back to a subject on which we touched before, albeit in a different context. We are discussing the relative powers of the mayor and the assembly in the processes and procedures of making, arriving at and finalising the budget. Will a majority of two thirds or a simple majority be required in the assembly to amend the budget proposed by the mayor, and ultimately to give it approval or otherwise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is slightly odd that the present wording of the Bill will allow one third of the assembly to pass a budget unamended. If one puts the question in the context of the influence and power of patronage that the mayor will undoubtedly have, and the possibility that the mayor may come from the same party that could make up a third of the assembly members, the assembly may be unable to prevent the mayor from proposing what in some circumstances could be an inappropriate or even irresponsible budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my analysis is correct—and I believe that it is—we should pause and think for a moment as to whether that is how we want the assembly to work. I accept that my argument is in the context of the debate that we have had about the relative powers of the mayor and assembly, and I make no apology for that. However, it is more specifically in the context of the fact that we must now consider the way in which we believe that the assembly should have oversight or the power to check the mayor in the crucial area of budget making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us, not even Ministers, are yet certain of the kind of relationships that are likely to develop between the mayor and the assembly, or of the political nature of the assembly, given the unpredictability of the election system that is set out in the Bill. Bearing those uncertainties in mind, rather than placing the hurdle as high as the Government have done in the present wording of the Bill, it would surely be preferable and more responsible to have a system whereby the assembly, by means of a traditional majority in the sense that we in this place understand it, could force the mayor into reconsidering and amending the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out the reasoning behind the amendments. They are worthy of consideration, and I hope that Ministers might seriously reconsider what they believe the relationship between the mayor and the assembly should be in the context of making and amending the budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the assembly is given more power, especially over budget making, than is currently envisaged in the Bill. That would allow for more and better scrutiny, and it would ensure that the mayor was not able to abuse the power given to him by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. He is equally eloquent with or without a briefing note, and the force of his argument came across particularly effectively when he spoke to amendment No. 344.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have returned to the essential question of the respective democratic legitimacy of the mayor and the assembly. We are used, in all our procedures and processes, to the concept of a majority of one being enough to secure an amendment, a change of policy, or the rejection of a Bill. That is the way in which we have always worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, however, we have provision for a qualified majority—a concept familiar in European terms. 	<i>[Interuption.]</i> The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) grunts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Appreciatively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Appreciatively in his case; it would have been less so in mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted to look at the matter more closely. The mayor may, by the nature of his personality—especially if he is a high-profile and perhaps non-political, figure—be unrepresentative of the ideological convictions of the majority of Londoners. Those doctrinal and ideological convictions would be better represented by the assembly men who, by their nature, are more likely to be party people; certainly the 11 top-up members are. That will apply especially to the 5 per cent, minimum that has been mooted—I will not say more—in the press as the threshold that the Government will impose for the rootless ones. They could represent London better, and, therefore, in order to carry out their job of scrutinising the budget properly, they have every right to call for an amendment to the budget if there is majority support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for Londoners, scrutiny, exercised on their behalf by the assembly men, to be hobbled by the restrictive provision of a requirement for a two-thirds majority. That could mean that a mayor would be able to railroad through—against the wishes of most Londoners—budgetary programmes inimical to the interests and desires of the electors of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore support in every respect the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, and so honourably moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. I hope that the Government will think again, because they could live to regret the proposal. If there were a doctrinal difference—an ideological or party difference—

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
between the mayor and the assembly, it would be best for them to come to an accommodation, rather than the mayor using the blunt majority power that the Government propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed but not surprised by the amendments. However, I was not surprised that it was the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst who moved them. I am only surprised at his surprise that he should be asked to assume the mantle of spokesman for the depleted band of Conservative Members in London. He did so most elegantly. That does not, however, change my view that the amendments are unacceptable to the Government. They go to the heart of the relationship between the mayor and the assembly that we have constructed very carefully in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor is the executive. We have constructed the procedure for the assessment of the budget with that fact in mind. The mayor will propose the budget. At the first hearing, the assembly may amend it on a simple majority. After that, the mayor has to consider whether to revise the budget, and has to submit a final budget, whether revised or not, to the assembly, which will again have a chance to debate it. On the second hearing, the assembly will still be empowered to amend the budget, but must secure a larger margin—a two-thirds majority—for its will to prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision is the result of our careful research into the working of mayoral systems in many other countries, and is based on two simple principles. The first is that there must be a budget. We must not allow a deadlock to arise that makes it impossible to set a budget. That is a problem that genuinely afflicts a number of mayoral systems in other cities. We do not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, because the mayor is elected as the executive by the people of London, it is right that the mayor should be in the driving seat. However, he or she should not have the ultimate power to determine the budget against a two-thirds majority. That is the balance; it is sensible and we do not accept the amendments from either Opposition party. They would weaken the position of the mayor and could be a recipe for confusion. Indeed, they could lead to no budget being set at all. Therefore, I urge he that the amendments be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

us on the role of the mayor and the assembly. The Minister has stressed that the mayor will be the executive and that the mayor will propose the budget, as if that were all there were to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the new executive mayor will be elected by Londoners at large, the assembly will represent Londoners in all their diversity—if I may revert to a phrase that we used earlier. The representation of the diversity of London will give the assembly not just equal legitimacy, but greater legitimacy, when it makes a budget. That is why I make the argument that I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister had a point when he referred to deadlock. However, I suspect that a lesson was learnt from the shutdown of Washington D.C. a few years ago. Congress undoubtedly suffered in the public view as it was perceived as creating the deadlock and preventing the setting of the budget. That lesson will probably stay with all elected bodies—executive mayors and assemblies—and may well preclude the possibility of future deadlock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, therefore, unpersuaded by the Minister and I stand by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
