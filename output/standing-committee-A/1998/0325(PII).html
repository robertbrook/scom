<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part X of the Bill is skeletal, which was the word used by both the Minister for London and Construction and the Minister for Transport in London. I probably should have used the words "presently skeletal", because the amendments were tabled before the new clauses, which we shall consider later. My amendments would put flesh on the bones of part X. I accept that the Bill should not be too prescriptive—a point that has been mentioned many times—but part X is under-prescriptive. As it mentions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1568</span>
specific matters in subsection (5), it would be reasonable to make certain amendments to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 813 would add the activities of recreational walking, riding and cycling to subsection (5), which currently ignores most aspects of outdoor activity. More people take part in recreational walking, cycling and riding than ever take part in sport. Two of the amendments were inspired after conversations and correspondence with the Open Spaces Society and, in particular, with Mr. Bernard Selwyn, its honorary parliamentary consultant, who is listening to the debate. It may be convenient to say now that I was a member of the society's Parliamentary Committee for about eight years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 811 would insert into the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"open space for reaction, visual enjoyment and nature conservation".</p></blockquote>
Open spaces are vital to our metropolitan city. I do not mean only the large open spaces such as metropolitan green belt land and metropolitan open space land, but London's protected squares and waterways, rivers, canals and reservoirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arndt No. 812 seeks to include archives. It was inspired through correspondence with the London Archive Users Forum. However, I acknowledge that the forum has subsequently written to all members of the Committee, saying that it prefers the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I willingly concede that amendment No. 1241 is more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part X recognises that the library and museum services have been important to London, and I share that view. I remind the Minister that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport recognises that the place of archives in the cultural framework is distinct from that of libraries and museums. I hope that the heads of Ministers at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will follow the hearts of the Ministers at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London boroughs are statutorily responsible for keeping their own records, but the London Metropolitan Archives, formerly the Greater London Record Office, has been run by the City Corporation since 1986. Indeed, the London Metropolitan Archives look after not only the records of the old London county council and the Greater London council, but court and ecclesiastical records and many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask for sympathetic treatment of my three amendments. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster reminded us, we are talking of archives and of archaeology. I conclude by offering the Committee the advice of the late Dame Agatha Christie, who said to a young lady contemplating matrimony, "if in doubt, marry an archaeologist, for the older you get the more interest they will take in you." I would add a brief addendum to that: "If you cannot find an archaeologist, go for an archivist." However, they are few and far between in London, so if you cannot find an archaeologist or an archivist, go for an old architect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the manner in which he moved his amendment, and his kind words about amendment No. 1241, to which I shall now speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest, Mr. Winterton, as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. There are two of us in the House of Commons, but I am much the more junior of the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy for the Committee to guess who is the other fellow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in my armoury a story relating to my noble Friend Lord Hailsham, which I have been tempted to use in the aftermath of various Liberal Democrat speeches, but for the certain knowledge, Mr. Winterton, that you would have ruled me out of order. However, it is now relevant. It relates to dinner in a college in Oxford where a particular person at the dinner rather went on during the dinner and the following morning Lord Hailsham said at breakfast, when complaints were issued about this person, "Ah, you should have been here in old Thomas's day. He had a story about Mesopotamia and until he had been going for 40 minutes you didn't know whether you were going to get the short or the long version."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could the right hon. Gentleman tell us how that story is relevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tell you precisely how it is relevant, Mr. Winterton. It is relevant because, in speaking to the amendment, I shall give you the short version; but if the Minister rejects the amendment, I shall subsequently give you the long one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) said that The London Archive Users Forum, which represents more than 350 professionals and amateurs, and organisations involved in research are worried that the Bill does not tackle the problems facing local authority archive services. Those problems are countrywide, but are most acute in London, where, despite recent improvements to the Londonwide service offered at the London Metropolitan Archives, formerly the Greater London Record Office—it received a passing reference in the Green Paper and has, as my hon. Friend said, been run by the City Corporation since the abolition of the GLC in 1986—there is widespread neglect of archives at borough level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those organisations' anxieties are shared by the professional archivists in the Greater London Archives Network. The Bill offers an opportunity to tackle the problem, which, it seems to them and to me, the mayor might reasonably tackle as part of his or her cultural strategy under part X. To ensure that that is done, it would be necessary for archive services to be specified in the Bill, otherwise—as happens at present—archives will continue to be a Cinderella compared with libraries and museums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forum is aware of and supports the principle in my hon. Friend's amendments, as do I. Amendment No. 812 would tackle the shortcomings of local authority archive services—which my longer version would, if necessary, specify. However, the forum believes that the mayor's cultural strategy should, ideally, be more broadly based
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1570</span>
and directed to safeguarding the written heritage, whether found in the private or the public sector. Hence my more general amendment, for which I am privileged to enjoy Liberal Democrat support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak first to the last amendment in the group, No. 1261, which we are happy to support in either the short or the long version. When we debated the abolition of the GLC, archives became—as I had not expected—a matter of great importance and great moment. We spent a long time on the matter, and tried to deal seriously with it. It exercised many people outside this place who wanted to ensure that London had a better means of looking after its archives. Indeed, the important job that has been done since the abolition of the GLC by what is now the London Metropolitan Archives, formerly the Greater London Record Office, just off Farringdon road, has been extremely well done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I woke up this morning to be told through my radio that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport had decided to give money to ensure that first editions of newspapers are kept at national archives. My family always tells me off for keeping my own version of that archival store in the belief that one day I shall have time to read them, which rarely arrives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to add the provision. The amendment in its short form could not be shorter: it is a one-word amendment. I strongly support that we expressly mention archives, because they are not even alluded to or implied anywhere else in the Bill—the Minister for London is about to correct me—apart from, as the Minister has corrected me, in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unsupported by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, we tabled another amendment in the group, No. 1258, which proposes that the strategy includes parks, landscapes and gardens. Unusually, a coalition has been formed on the Opposition Benches between the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet and the rest of us, who are seeking to persuade Ministers to be not prescriptive but amply illustrative. Those categories should be included. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet makes a good case for open spaces and for recreational activities. I should like to add parks, landscapes and gardens, which have been recognised by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as important, and specifically receive lottery money. To give one example of how important they are, Burgess park, in my constituency, was created in the 1940s on what was, before the bombs dropped, built-up land, and has effectively taken 50 years to reach maturity. Ultimately, it was taken over by Groundwork, rather than being run by the local authority, because when the GLC was abolished, the local authority did not have the capacity to manage and develop such an important and strategic park.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitzpatrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was not Burgess park one of the starting points for one of the major demonstrations to defend the GLC against abolition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, too; it also saw some other demonstrations in its time.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1571</span>
The provision of large metropolitan open spaces is often not the sole responsibility of a single borough; for obvious reasons, the responsibility often crosses borough boundaries. Lea Valley park in the east end is a good example of a park that has special status, as is Victoria park on the borders of Tower Hamlets and Hackney. Some parks are more than local municipal sports parks. Many council parks are of significance to London—Southwark park in my constituency, for example, which is at the entrance to the Rotherhithe tunnel. It is not just a beautifully laid-out Victorian park; it was also hugely developed by the one of the great early 20th-century women who had a great impact on the political life of Bermondsey: Ada Salter who was mayor of Bermondsey, but also married to the most eminent of my predecessors this century—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bob Mellish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much more eminent than Bob Mellish; I would say that even if he were alive, which regrettably he is not. Ada Salter was the wife of Alfred Salter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A park such as Southwark park needs sometimes to be seen as part of the breadth, importance and the diversity of London parks. It is not just a local jewel. Having received lottery funding just this week, it can now be restored to something like its former glory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the arguments of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. He made the case for open space in general, wearing his Open Spaces Society hat; that Organisation gives the whole country a good service. I hope that the Minister will take a relaxed view and acknowledge that there are other serious contenders for inclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his concluding remarks, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey focused on the nub of the problem. An enormous number of items could be candidates for inclusion. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is nodding; maybe not because of what I was saying, although I hope so. If one ends up producing lists, they get longer and longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted; I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's support. The danger of lists is that those who are not on them feel aggrieved, lists cease to be illustrative and become exclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no difficulty in agreeing that the activities highlighted in the amendments are entirely proper ones for consideration as part of a cultural strategy for London. We have no hostility towards any of those activities—which all, in different ways, enrich our quality of life and all of which could be included in a cultural strategy. I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments. However, the essential point is that a comprehensive list ceases to be what the clause is: namely illustrative of the kind of issues that should be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster mentioned archives, as did the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. Archives are extremely important. My right hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1572</span>
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport only recently made it clear that his responsibility includes archives and that he wishes them to be integrated fully into our cultural life. Furthermore, I pay tribute to the London Metropolitan Archives, which is an important facility for Londoners. I have no doubt that the mayor will work closely with it in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have outlined, we are not minded to accept the amendments. I am not intimidated by the threat from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster to give us the long, rather than the short, version of the Mesopotamian story. I shall listen to it with enormous interest and I shall also look towards you, Mr. Winterton, to see whether it is fully in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is defending the position from which the Bill started, but he has failed to explain why the roughly 15 items on the list—I say "roughly", because it is a little difficult to count them—amount to a perfect number and why the addition of one item, such as archives, would spoil that beautifully concocted and contrived exemplar. The Minister must justify those 15 items if he is to sustain his excluding any others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but I shall reiterate what I said earlier. Our list is not meant to be perfect, nor is it meant to be full and comprehensive; it is illustrative. Once we go beyond an illustrative list and start adding other items, there will be no limit on how many others can legitimately claim to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted the amendments, I have no doubt that on Report more amendments would be tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, given the tendency of the Liberal Democrats, and other hon. Members who sought to augment the list. When the Bill reaches the other place, I have no doubt that there will be further requests and, before long, rather than having an illustrative list that was designed to suggest the range of activities but which was in no way exclusive, there would be a long, complex and potentially exclusive list from which those who were excluded would feel aggrieved. The hon. Gentleman must think about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, and I am even willing to give undertakings about my actions on Report. I seriously believe that archives might be the sort of item that those in the other place might insist on including in the list. It may be much better for the Minister to concede graciously and expand the list slightly, given that neither his list nor ours are perfect, rather than suffer defeat in the House of Lords and have to admit that he would have been willing to make such a concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As and when the Bill reaches the Lords, and assuming that the Committee looks kindly on new clause 92, the Bill will contain an explicit reference to the powers of the authority to give
	<br><blockquote><p>"grants for the purposes of any museum, gallery, library, archive or other cultural institution in Greater London."</p></blockquote>
That is clear evidence of our support for archives, and there could be no possible justification for their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1573</span>
Lordships doubting that commitment. I do not envisage the scenario raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey being a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to metropolitan open space and parks; they are important, but he will recall that, under the planning section of the Bill, the special development strategy is the right context for the mayor to develop policies for the promotion of open space as well as other similar facilities. As he will appreciate, in the context of the joined-up thinking, joined-up government that we are promoting, the fact that such matters do not feature in one section of the responsibilities of the Greater London authority does not mean that the issue will not be taken seriously.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is no doubt being discussed on the Floor of the House at the moment, there is no point in uttering a threat if you withdraw it in the face of intransigence by the other side. I said that I would give a longer version of my story, which relates to the present archival state in London, if the Minister was not conciliatory in his response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London Metropolitan Archives, formerly the Greater London Record Office, has been run by the Corporation of London since 1960. It performs the important function of looking after the records of the pan-London bodies, the London county council and the Greater London council, as well as miles of court and ecclesiastical records and the records of important London businesses, hospitals and other institutions. That is common cause between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible for the London Metropolitan Archives to meet all of London's archive needs, especially at the more local level. It is not resourced to do so, and it would not regard that as being within its remit. Each London borough is statutorily responsible for its own records under section 224 of the Local Government Act 1972. However, local authorities' duties in respect of their records are expressed in very general terms. In effect, the extent of duty is defined by the authority itself. In other words, it is not similar to the power of the Secretary of State in the context of libraries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National legislation governing local authorities' archives and local studies' collections is contained in the Local Government (Records) Act 1962.1 suspect that my father may have been responsible for that Act, and although it enables all London authorities to make archive provision and create local history collections, it is permissive only. Standards of provision in relation to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1574</span>
access to borough councils, own official records and to material for studies of localities more generally vary considerably between authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standards of service were summarised in "Towards 2000: the Future of London's Archives", published by the Greater London Archives network in 1993. Of the 33 London local authorities, more than a third have no professional archivist. Some boroughs make no provision for access to the archives created by the local authority itself, much less make provision to take in historic records created by institutions, businesses or individuals in the local area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations creating historic records of local significance, as well as national bodies responsible for distributing records to repositories, experience considerable difficulties when depositing records in London, because some boroughs remain unable to receive collections of important archive material. There is no duty, as things stand, to take an active role in collecting local material of historical interest and making it available to the country. However, some authorities choose to do so. Camden, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham and Westminster local authorities play an active role, and pay tribute to the political colour of those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Facilities for the study of the locality for the purposes of local business and an understanding of the built environment can enhance and inform public participation in planning and development issues. Some boroughs, which employ professional staff and endeavour to provide a serious service for the public, nevertheless leave those services desperately under-resourced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some borough archivists say that they cannot accept the deposit of more material because their small safe storage provision is full. That will prejudice the resources available for future generations. London needs an even standard of provision as a matter of urgency, so that council tax payers in all metropolitan areas can expect the same standards of archive provision from their local council. That does not entail excessive expense, but should meet the standards laid down by the royal commission on historical manuscripts for the storage and custody of records, access to collections and the provision of reasonable opening hours for consulting archive materials. A local authority archive service has little relevance if the public are not given adequate access to the records that it retains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London local archives are important to retain records of the authority itself, to avoid operational and reputational risk, to facilitate the right of local people to consult council records, to preserve records relating to the activities of communities at local level, to promote records for educational use in local schools, to establish a unique and irreplaceable record of the history and identity of a local community, to create a resource for interpreting the actions of those in local communities, and the physical evidence, including the building, artefacts and structures that they leave behind, and to collect records reflecting the ethnic diversity of the communities that make up each London authority.

Often a forgotten resource or requirement, the need for adequate and efficient record keeping features strongly as a key background issue in forthcoming legislation. Current initiatives include the freedom of information proposal and best value. The importance of records will not diminish in the near future: quite the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stakeholders in London's government need adequate local archive services now to ensure that their entitlement to the information contained in local records can be fulfilled, and to create a future framework for adequate record retention. The mayor, in publishing or implementing his strategy, will be uniquely well placed to take the lead, to stimulate and encourage those boroughs that respond to the challenge of providing suitable archive services, to co-ordinate borough services and encourage the development of centres of excellence, and to name and shame those who lag behind the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed simple amendment—I shall refer to it again at the end of my speech—would mean that archives cannot be swept under the strategy carpet. Its general terms mean that the mayor's strategy could take account of archives in the private as well as the local government sector. The mayor could encourage local authorities to meet acceptable standards and to make adequate provision for the custody of, and access to, archives and local studies material. He could promote co-operative ventures between boroughs if a single authority could not make adequate provision from its own resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor could encourage the royal commission on historical manuscripts to assume an active role in supervising standards within London local archive services and urge local authorities to achieve official, recognised repository status by adopting the commission's standards. He could strengthen the link between local archive services and the record-creating functions of the authority to stimulate the efficient and cost-effective management of records and information. He could also raise the profile of archives, and foster public awareness of their importance to the private and public sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would speak to the amendment briefly. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has made the point on my behalf: what singles out the word "archive" as being inappropriate when 15 other categories have been included? It is not as if we have been overwhelmed, as we have on certain other subjects, by a massive briefing from all over London, asking for an addition to the Bill. On this particular question, it is the Government who are urging the need for a strategic authority so strongly, yet London is ill-equipped for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon.

Given that subsection (5) specifies 15 matters, the inclusion of archives, if necessary—but not to make it too prescriptive, to the exclusion of movable antiquities—would give the entire subsection more balance.

The Minister mentioned joined-up government. Given what the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has said about the importance of archives, I should have thought that it was in the Government's interests to include that word.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1232, in page 132, line 13, at end insert—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(5A) The Mayor may give the Cultural Strategy Group for London directions draft strategy to be formulated and submitted under subsection (1) above not later than such date as may be specified in the directions.</li>
	<li>(5B) The Cultural Strategy Group for London shall comply with any directions under subsection (5A) above.".</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment (b) to the proposed amendment: leave out "comply with" and insert "have regard to".</p>
	<p>Government amendment No. 1233.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments will enable the mayor to direct the cultural strategy group for London to formulate a draft culture strategy and submit it by a set date. They clarify the wording of the Bill to make explicit the fact that the mayor must consult the CSGL when proposing to make any culture strategy when those revisions have not been proposed by the group itself. Amendment (b) to Government amendment No. 1232 would allow the CSGL merely to have regard to rather than comply with the directions of the mayor to produce a cultural strategy. I cannot believe that that would be a sensible outcome, especially as we have debated on several occasions the importance of mechanisms to ensure that strategies are implemented, as hon. Members will recall. In many other areas, we have given specific powers either to the mayor or, in some circumstances, to the Secretary of State, to ensure that strategies are implemented. It would be curious in the extreme if mechanisms were provided to require that the spatial and economic development strategies and the environmental strategies be implemented but we suggested that we were not interested in whether the cultural strategy was implemented or revised. That would imply an extraordinary lack of seriousness about the cultural strategy in comparison with all the others. The amendment is, therefore, ill-conceived, and is typical of Opposition attempts to weaken the position of the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original wording of the clause is not clear on the procedures to be followed when revising or consulting on the culture stratgegy. The procedure if the CSGL itself suggests revisions is obviously straightforward; the group will submit them to the mayor for consideration. However, if the mayor or a third party wishes to make revisions, the position of the CSGL is not clearly defined in the Bill. That is why amendment No. 1233 is necessary. It explicitly states that the CSGL must be consulted on revisions not originating with itself, under the general powers of clause 34 (1). Clause 34 (3) will also need to be read so as to ensure that in such cases the CSGL will be consulted, along with the assembly and the functional bodies, before any other bodies or persons. That is another demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure that the CSGL will not be simply a powerless entity without significant power to act in the interests of London culture. It will be, from start to finish, an integral part of the provision of a cultural strategy. The amendments clarify that and I hope that the Committee welcomes them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1578</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister played the theme and now, not surprisingly, there is a variation. The only argument that I made in favour of our proposal that, rather than the mayor having the ultimate control and authority that the Government propose, the CSG should have some autonomy, was to use the following example. If a mayor, having perhaps three months earlier set the group the task of creating a strategy, then suddenly issued directions that it must be delivered by next Friday—or the end of the month, or next month, or the year—and the CSG did not think that that gave it enough time to produce anything other than a shoddy job, the mayor would have the power not only to insist that the strategy be produced by that date, but that the resulting document came from the CSG, even if the group were unhappy with it. The Government do not realise that allowing the mayor all the last words may result in a less than best product. My theme is not original; nor is the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's words were rather alarming. I agree with the sentiment that he expressed in his response to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but he said that "have regard to" implies a degree of option or discretion about whether the relevant body complies. The Government Whip nods in agreement. The problem is that, throughout the clauses on planning, the phrase "have regard to" is described as mandatory; indeed, the use of "have regard to" in the whole planning structure implies a degree of mandatory observance. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that highly alarming discrepancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on the fact that we also have mandatory guidance in planning, even though most people would think that only direction ensures compliance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He may be interested to know that the planning Bar, which is permitted, under the Pepper v. Hart principle, to look at the Minister's interpretation of the clauses, will now be rubbing its hands with glee at the prospect of something like 10 years' worth of litigation and the fees that will be generated by the varying interpretations made today—including by the Minister—on the planning clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Croydon, South makes a pertinent point and, in so doing, makes the case for my opposition to the amendment. If Parliament were seen to have removed "shall comply with" and to have substituted "shall have regard to", the inference that will inevitably be drawn is that less force is to be attached to the original wording of the Bill. If we were to do that, it might be concluded that the cultural strategy group would not be required to comply with the mayor's direction. I hope that Opposition Members recognise that that is why it would be dangerous to accept the amendment. I hope that they will accept our amendments, and not press the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inference of the Minister's remark is that "have regard to" implies a discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1579</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inference was that if Parliament were seen to have deliberately weakened the force of the Bill by substituting the words shall "have regard to" for "shall comply with", an inference could be drawn to that effect. The hon. Gentleman will know that the concept of "having regard to" implies that the body, subject to that responsibility, is expected to pay very careful regard to what is said. That is not the same as "shall comply with". Having considered what the group has to have regard to, if there are good reasons for it to reach a different view, that option is available. The hon. Gentleman will recognise that that is the case, and courts would find on those lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Parliament had substituted the words shall "have regard to" for "shall comply with", there would be a clear inference that there was a deliberate intention to give less weight to the obligation to follow the mayor's directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is where the Minister runs into trouble. The words "have regard to" are weakening the obligation to comply with. That is also where he ran into trouble with the planning clauses, which is why we tabled amendments on the advice of members of the planning Bar to tidy them up, but they were rejected by the Minister. Nevertheless, the debate is becoming slightly academic and the Minister is right about the principle of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have not practised administrative law recently, I would be surprised if those who interpret the Bill would regard the same phrase as being open to a different legal interpretation. I ally myself with the hon. Member for Croydon, South: if the Minister stands on the argument that the amendment would reduce compliance, it would be difficult to argue that that would not have a similar status elsewhere in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment (a) permits the authority to provide funding for the Centre for Young Musicians. Yehudi Menuhin, who died last week, said that a criminal never came out of a music school. It is important that the effectiveness of music training is properly recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Centre for Young Musicians does a fine and sterling job on behalf of the young people of our capital. It provides tuition for musically talented young people from London schools. It operates mainly at Morley college at weekends in term time and at various places in the school holidays. The centre organises several orchestras, concert bands and other ensembles for young musicians. The best known of these is the London Schools Symphony Orchestra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's White Paper, which outlines their proposals for London's new mayor and assembly states that the Government intend—it does not say "if circumstances permit" or "if the mayor feels like it"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the Centre for Young Musicians, currently funded in part by the Department for Education and Employment, should also become the responsibility of the GLA, with the appropriate transfer of resources."</p></blockquote>
It is a matter of some concern to me and my colleagues that that pledge is not being honoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to a parliamentary question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth), the shadow Minister for Culture, the Minister for London and Construction said that the Centre for Young Musicians fell
	<br><blockquote><p>"into the category of organisations which the GLA may choose to assist".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 404.]</p></blockquote>
Since then, the Minister has answered another question, which was dated yesterday, and to which the Minister for Transport in London referred earlier. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am discussing the future funding of the CYM—and possible arrangements for the transfer of that funding to the GLA—with my colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment and we will make an announcement as soon as possible. Specific provision is not required in the GLA Bill to achieve any transfer."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24 March 1999; Vol. 328, c. 252.]</p></blockquote>
There is still no firm commitment to honour, that pledge. That is why we tabled the amendments, in an effort to secure, in undeniable terms the existence of such a valuable centre. Music education is at the heart of London life. To cramp London's education is a backward step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In new clause 97, we attempt to raise a concern that should properly be discussed in the Committee, indeed, it led me to table a written question—part of the answer to which the hon. Member for Croydon, South just referred to—seeking clarification about those aspects of responsibility such as the Centre for Young Musicians and others to which the White Paper referred, but which did not appear in the Bill. I wanted to know what was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer was illuminating in terms of the Government's thought processes on a variety of matters relating to the Bill, but one matter on which I am not entirely clear—perhaps we can achieve greater clarity today— concerns the Centre for Young Musicians. That body was previously funded by the Greater London council and then by the Inner London education authority; after that, it had to seek potential funding from a host of private funds as well as relying on the support of the Department for Education and Employment. From the White Paper, the Government's intention appeared to correspond with our wish to bring the CYM home to the government of London, but want to establish today how that intention appears to have turned into a more permissive power in the Bill. If the Government cannot come to a conclusion on our proposals, they should consider whether a permissive power is enough in respect of that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will know—because we have all received briefing material on it—the Centre for Young Musicians has more than 2,400 students spread across London. Students who are being trained by the centre can be found in all 32 London boroughs. As the hon. Member for Croydon, South rightly pointed out, the White Paper said that the Government intended to make the CYM the responsibility of the Greater London authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth hearing in mind that similar arrangements to those proposed by the Liberal Democrats and the hon. Member for Croydon, South and his colleagues already exist in other parts of the country. County and metropolitan councils already have responsibility for sponsoring similar organisations. We are therefore anxious to obtain from the Government the clearest assurance that they are still considering how this organisation can best be provided for and protected for the benefit of Londoners into the future. I understand that, at the moment, only about 5 per cent, of the CYM's costs are met by central Government funding, which raises the question of how it can secure future long-term funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, the CYM is one of the organisations that have attempted successfully over the past decade or more to survive the abolition of the GLC. It has been successful at fund raising, obtaining more than £4 million over that period to enable it to survive. With the creation of a new government for London, however we have the opportunity to bring it back to that government. I hope that the Minister can tell us how that is going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the written answer that I received yesterday, and from which the hon. Member for Croydon, South quoted, the Minister concluded by saying:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1583</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am discussing the future of funding of the CYM—and possible arrangements for the transfer of that funding to the GLA—with my colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment and we will make an announcement as soon as possible. Specific provision is not required in the GLA Bill to achieve any transfer."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24 March 99; Vol. 328, c. 252.]</p></blockquote>
I assume that that answer is partly due to new clause 92, which gives a general power to make a grant, but are there any other powers already in the Bill that made that answer possible? Will the Minister give us an update on his discussions? That would be most useful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not attached my name to any official Opposition amendments so far—except the ones relating to the Metropolitan police, which I had the privilege of moving—but I have attached my name to this one, in part because there is a close link between the centre, the orchestra and my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Westminster became the lead borough for the centre of excellence when the abolition of the Inner London education authority removed the previous underpinning of the centre and the orchestra. I in no way intend to be aggressive towards the Government—there is common cause across the Committee—but the centre of excellence is an extremely important institution worthy of London as a whole, and one that we should find ways of sustaining. I shall not read out the entire briefing to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) referred, as all members of the Committee have received it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When ILEA was abolished by Parliament during the previous Administration, I must confess that I was one of those who was not entirely happy with that decision—not least because of the views put to me by Peter Newsam, education officer for the authority, about how well some London boroughs would be able to take on that responsibility. One consequence of that abolition was, of course, the fate of that institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare an interest. Sir David Hancock, who has been a champion of both institutions during the past 10 years, was my contemporary as an undergraduate. He was a permanent Secretary at the Department of Education and Science when I was a Minister there. Our old college was kind enough to give a "Yes, Minister" dinner, to which Nigel Hawthorne was unable to come, but to which Paul Eddington came. Not least because of the Department's responsibility for the institution after the abolition of ILEA, Sir David has been a considerable champion of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City corporation in the other half of my constituency has been a significant supporter of the institution. It has enjoyed that support in various guises for some while. The City's Bridge House grants committee and the City educational trust fund support the Centre for Young Musicians, and the corporation separately supports the London Schools symphony orchestra. The corporation has recently agreed to fund the orchestra for a further two years. The City recognises the centre and the orchestra as an important mechanism to provide musical education for London children based on musical ability, rather than ability to pay, and hopes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1584</span>
that that continued support will bridge the gap until a permanent arrangement is made to secure longer-term finance of that deserving Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City has misgivings that unless some way is found to provide the core funding—not the funding for particular ventures and initiatives, which the institution has been exceptionally successful in raising—it may not be able indefinitely to continue its support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South quoted paragraph 5.191 of the White Paper, which is dotted with caveats. Various matters may be transferred to the GLA, but are all subject to the outcome of the comprehensive spending review, or discussions with English Heritage as part of the review. No such caveat was attached to the intention that the Centre for Young Musicians, currently funded in part by the Department and Education and Employment, should also become the responsibility of the GLA, with the appropriate transfer of resources. We are all conscious of how that statement has been shaded by Ministers in Parliamentary answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Support exists elsewhere for such institutions. It has not existed in London since 1990, when it ceased for reasons with which we are familiar—the Londonwide authority disappeared. It is Labour and the Liberal Democrats who have pressed for the return of such an authority. In civil service terms, there is a continuum in the concept of Her Majesty's Government. The Government removed the funding when ILEA was abolished and pushed the institution out on its own; it therefore may be considered the Government's responsibility to ensure that, when an opportunity returns through a Londonwide authority, it should be taken. I emphasise again that it is the core funding about which there is concern; the institution itself is thoroughly healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one question for the Minister for Transport in London, concerning her reference to grants to archives. That was the one fig leaf that the Minister for London and Construction used to say that the Government were powerfully interested in the subject, although I do not mean to denigrate the argument that he deployed. The national curriculum has placed a greater emphasis on hands-on use by school students of primary-source material. The local availability of such material in London boroughs varies from the well resourced and well managed through the under resourced and well managed to the absolutely pitiful and virtually non-existent. At the heart of the archivists' concern is coping with the problem, rather than the provision of grant money in particular cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great encouragements of the past decade or so in London has been hearing the London Schools symphony orchestra, as I have often done at the Barbican and elsewhere. The orchestra has been a particular source of encouragement about the prospect of London having its own high quality, home-grown musicians. I am grateful for all those occasions. I therefore argue strongly that although the Government would usually say—as they have done throughout the Committee's sittings—that the matter is for the GLA, in this case, for reasons explained by other hon. Members, and especially because of the unqualified nature of the commitment made recently in the White Paper, they should respond positively.

A former employee of my party, Chris Crowcroft, was involved with the Centre for Young Musicians in the 1980s. The Minister and I share responsibility for Morley college, which straddles our consituency boundaries. Ensuring that it continued and thrived was the subject of much debate when the GLC and ILEA were abolished The Centre for Young Musicians has its home there, where much of the tuition occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to cite one additional fact from the information given to us by the foundation set up to support the centre. It tells us—and we have no reason to doubt it—that the centre has not turned away any young musician of talent because of lack of funds. It has always found the ability to support London's young musicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one final point. It might be argued that such matters can be left to the free market, and that the boroughs can pick up the responsibility on their own. To put it bluntly, I have never heard as good a youth orchestra put together in Southwark by Southwark, or in or by—I think, without having done a complete trawl—any other single London local authority. The great benefit of the centre is that it gives teaching, training and solidarity to a large group of young people, and an orchestra at the end of it with sufficient credibility to undertake national and international tours and to draw large audiences. That could not be achieved on a borough-by-borough basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the written answer that the Government gave yesterday to my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, I hope that they will say that although their answer is to delay the decision, the decision reached will be the one referred to in the White Paper, and that the centre will therefore be safe under the ample wings of the GLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with special pleading—it is a perfectly respectable and legitimate political activity, and we have heard much of it this afternoon. I think, however, that this is the wrong place and time for special pleading. If people wish to plead for worthy causes, they should go to their elected representatives in bodies that raise money and disburse it and argue their case there. They can argue it with their borough councils, and they will be able to do so—although I have always opposed it—with the GLA. The Government new clause gives ample coverage for such causes. It allows the authority to
	<br><blockquote><p>"pay grants for the purposes of any museum, gallery, library, archive or other cultural institution".</p></blockquote>
That strikes me as pretty all-embracing and inclusive, and so be it. However, it would be a dangerous precedent to attempt to put particular worthy causes or institutions into the Bill; it would be an inflexible way of proceeding, and a road down which I certainly could not go. I strongly suspect that the Minister will tell us that the Government believe that it would be inadvisable and, if so, I will agree with her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has spent any time in Government will understand the difficulty of saying no with which Governments, councils and authorities are constantly faced. However, Government should be more about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1586</span>
saying no than saying yes. There is nothing in the world easier than to say yes to a worthy cause, and it is even easier if one is disbursing someone else's money in the direction of that worthy cause. The really difficult thing is to say, "I am sorry, but I can't justify it in this case" or, "Will you please address your request to those who are properly charged with the responsibility of fulfilling it?". The Committee is not a body to disburse money by statute to any causes, however worthy. I shall, I suppose, support new clause 92, but I regret that I cannot support amendments that seek to give statutory money to worthy causes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I failed to speak to new clause 99 in my opening remarks, and I should briefly like to do so. Before I do that, I say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that if he knows of any better way in which we can hold the Government to a pledge that they made in a White Paper, I would be happy to phrase our amendments in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 99 would provide that all funding for culture, media and sport in Greater London is channelled via the authority. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said earlier, the current situation is that many museums are in the portfolio of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, library services are retained by the London boroughs and buildings and monuments such as the Albert memorial and many others are under the DCMS, as are ancient monuments and sites and the royal parks. The point of the amendment is to illustrate that the funding of a large number of organisations will completely bypass the authority. There is a Gordian knot of bureaucracy that needs to be broken and simplified. While the Minister may not agree with the precise sentiment of the new clause, I hope that he will agree that I have a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is arguing that bodies such as the London Arts Board, the Arts Council, English Heritage, the Sports Council or the Museums and Galleries Commission, to name but a few, should be ignored. However, they could best revert to advocacies on behalf of those that they have in the past rather haphazardly represented, and channel all their efforts into implementing the agreed strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendment (a), which deals with the Centre for Young Musicians. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey have underlined the fact that the Centre for Young Musicians is one of excellence in encouraging and training young musicians recruited from throughout London. As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, it was our intention, as set out in the White Paper, that responsibility for the CYM should transfer to the" GLA with an appropriate transfer of resources. As has already been said, the CYM was founded in 1970 by ILEA. When ILEA was abolished in 1990, the boroughs became the education authorities. However, they were not required to continue funding the Centre for Young Musicians, so a new charitable trust was established—the Foundation for Young Musicians, which is the umbrella organisation incorporating the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1587</span>
London Schools symphony orchestra. I regret that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is not in his place, because he was glowing in his praise for the excellence of that orchestra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, Westminster was the lead borough for contributions to the centre from other boroughs, but London boroughs were not required to contribute. Many do, however, contribute towards tuition fees for students from their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1990, the Department for Education and Employment has grant-aided the centre for young musicians. Originally, that grant was intended to tide the foundation over until it received sufficient sponsorship from London boroughs. Nearly all London boroughs now subscribe to the foundation for young musicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department for Education and Employment has never paid the full running costs of £300,000 a year to which Sir David Hancock refers in the article in yesterday's 	<i>Evening Standard.</i> Until 1996, the DFEE grant was about £100,000 a year. Since then, it has been tapered down from £75,000 to £50,000 a year. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment values the work of the CYM, as we do, and will with us try to ensure that it continues to play a successful role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we developed the Bill, it became increasingly clear that it would be inappropriate to require the GLA to take on responsibility for the Centre for Young Musicians. Our advice is that inclusion of the amendment relating to the centre could make the Bill hybrid. There are many London voluntary organisations in this great capital city that provide such encouragement, training and inspiration not only for young people but for a wide range of people and interests in London. It would be inappropriate for the Centre for Young Musicians to be the only voluntary Organisation to be treated in that way. We have therefore concluded that the Bill should not provide for the transfer of responsibility for CYM to the GLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as a strategic authority established to address Londonwide issues, the GLA will be able to co-operate with the responsible statutory authorities and other bodies in the coordination and facilitation of specialist services that may need to be delivered on a Londonwide basis. We would expect the Centre for Young Musicians to fall into a category of organisations that the GLA may choose to help in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are convinced, and I trust that the Committee are persuaded, that it must be for the authority, not central Government, to decide whether to support that organisation, rather than other equally worthwhile organisations pursuing similar worthy purposes. In the light of what I have said, I trust that the amendment will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister on the question of hybridity, which I understand. The Bill is about Greater London government; in that sense, by definition, it is not a national Bill—it is in legislative terms, but not in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1588</span>
geographical import. As the Centre for Young Musicians is a pan-London or Londonwide body, I would be Grateful to hear more categorically what advice the Government have received to the effect that the provision would make it hybrid. We have discussed the London Ecology Centre, and other organisations, which are referred to in the Bill, and which are no different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Gentleman will accept what I am about to say. I will write to him about precisely why the inclusion of the new clause would make the Bill hybrid, and I will copy the letter to every other member of the Committee. The London Ecology Unit, which the hon. Gentleman gave as an example of why the Bill would not be hybrid, is not a good example because the unit will be absorbed into the authority. I will obtain further information and furnish the whole Committee with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 99 provides a much wider basis for grant than the Government's new clause; indeed, so broad is it that the GLA would be open to receiving and having to assess applications from individuals. That would not be an appropriate burden for the mayor. The wider power could be delegated to the cultural strategy group for London, thus establishing it as an executive grant-giving body with wide powers. That is not the Government's intention; our intention is that the CSGL will give supportive advice to help the mayor provide leadership for London. That is what Londoners will have voted for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two final subsections would remove the power of the Secretary of State to make grants within London, save through the GLA, the boroughs or common council. It is likely that grants will be made in that way, but the Secretary of State must surely retain the freedom to give grants should they be necessary. There could be instances where something of national importance needed to be funded in that way. If the new clause were accepted, it would prevent that. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South not to press the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the close of my speech, I asked the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman. He raised the issue not so much of the archive collections as such, but of the management and dissemination of the facility throughout the whole of London. Grant will not be given exclusively for purchasing or maintaining archives; it could quite justifiably be given for precisely the purpose to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. I trust that that answers his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was looking at— me in a slightly interrogative way. My preoccupation, frankly, was with the quite substantial proportion of London local authorities with no archive service at all. Children are, therefore, denied that aspect of the national curriculum. I do not think that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood from the right hon. Gentleman's question that he was not clear about whether grant could be provided for causes or whether it was exclusively for the purchase or maintenance of a specific archive. He has concerns about the national curriculum and the inadequacy of pan-London provision for such facilities. If a request was made to the effect that such a facility could and should be provided with the aid of grant, that would be entirely within the terms of the mayor's provisions for grant and considerations for the giving of such grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have missed it, but I did not hear the Minister respond to amendment (b) to new clause 92. That is partly, I suspect, because I did not speak to it—that would be an entirely fair criticism for the Minister to make of me. However, in my desire to speak to new clause 97 and to amendment (a) to new clause 92, which is in the name of the hon. Member for Croydon, South, I decided to focus my earlier remarks on those. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will set out the reasons why the Government are or are not willing to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam ever needs to emphasise to the Committee his desire to speak; we have had evidence of that on many occasions. I did not speak to his amendment because he had not spoken to it, but I shall now address amendment (b) to new clause 92.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable the mayor to set conditions for grant in order to target particular categories of users so that they might have cheaper access for the cultural purpose in question. However, as the mayor already has the power to do that under the Bill, it is a redundant amendment and I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that the Bill already provides that power—I shall look at it again to find the relevant clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address the Minister's comments on amendment (a). I was rather hoping that she would say that although it was not possible to accept the amendment, she could give an assurance that funding for the Centre for Young Musicians would be forthcoming. However, I am afraid that she has not given that undertaking. The Minister is looking at me rather fiercely; perhaps I may have missed the point that she was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes feel that there is something curious about the vision of the hon. Member for Croydon, South. He castigates me for looking at him fierce—although that is entirely subjective and interpretative—and he accuses me of over-using my hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had made it clear that we believe that it would be inappropriate to insist that the mayor takes over exclusive financial responsibility for this voluntary organisation when there are so many other worthy voluntary organisations in London. However, I also said that we are working with my right hon. Friend the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms that it is short of a categorical assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be inviting Committee members to cast a vote on this, but before they do so, they may be interested to know how many students from the Centre for Young Musicians they have in their constituencies. There are 80 CYM students in constituency of the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), 43 in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Coleman) and 26 in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore. The Government Whip, the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) has 309 CYM students in his constituency, the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town has 182, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall has 154, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has 213, the Minister for Transport in London, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) has 129 and the Minister for London and Construction, the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) has no fewer than 227. Do not worry, the rest of you are off the hook including the hon. Members for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) and for Solihull. When hon. Members come to cast their vote, they should be aware of what they are voting against. Those students expect the funding for their organisation to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not push this to a vote if there was an assurance that funding would continue. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst rightly made the point that this would, in effect, make the Bill hybrid; I agree with him completely, but I know of no other way of making our point on the clear undertaking given in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know when it is reported. Before he sits down, perhaps he might see whether the Minister is willing, if not to give the undertaking that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would settle for that undertaking, and the Minister will have heard the way in which the hon.

	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it appropriate to say again that since the abolition of the Inner London education authority in 1990, the Centre for Young Musicians has had no guaranteed funding. As I said, a charitable trust has been established—the Foundation for Young Musicians—which incorporates the Centre for Young Musicians and the London Schools symphony orchestra.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1591</span>
The centre has been funded since 1990 by the boroughs and by grant aid from the Department for Education and Employment. I have made it clear that, working with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, we will seek to ensure that it can continue to play a successful role. I have pointed out that it is entirely within the mayoral powers to co-operate with statutory and other bodies for the centre. We are discussing an institution that addresses a pan-London issue: encouragement and training for young musicians from throughout London. As I have said, it would be quite wrong to single out one such organisation, however brilliant and valuable, however much it has supported young musicians and however vital a role it plays in the life of London. It is not the only such voluntary body or charitable institution that plays a major part in the life of Londoners, and it would be wrong to single out one such organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also amazed that the hon. Member for Croydon, South can display such a cavalier attitude about the possibility of the Government producing a hybrid Bill. His party consistently claims to argue for the quality of legislation, or so I understand, but he is prepared to allow a hybrid Bill to be enacted. Labour Members are not prepared to do so, and in the light of my remarks, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general terms, this group of new clauses gives the GLA, acting through the mayor, certain powers and duties in respect of tourism in Greater London. They require the mayor to promote Greater London as a tourist destination both in its own right and as a gateway to the rest of the United Kingdom. The authority will have broad powers to achieve that general objective. The mayor will receive grant in aid from the Secretary of State and will be required to consult and co-operate with the Secretary of State, existing tourist boards and other relevant persons and organisations. He will also be required to give advice to the tourist boards and Ministers if asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the provision in more detail. The mayor will promote London as a tourist destination in its own right and as a first destination or start point for visitors from overseas to the rest of the United Kingdom. The mayor will also seek to provide and improve facilities and amenities used by visitors. The mayor will clearly need to have a strategy for the development of tourism in London. Tourism will need to be fully taken into account in both the economic development strategy and the cultural strategy. The overall economic strategy and the strategy for tourism will have been drawn up by the mayor and the London development agency working together, and should therefore be interconnected. It is for the mayor to determine the extent to which he or she would ask the LDA to take on the implementation of the tourism strategy, but, as tourism affects and is affected by so many aspects of life in the capital, it is certain that LDA involvement will be essential for tourism's future success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given tourism's importance to London, it is right that the mayor should take the lead on tourism. Just as importantly, the Bill makes it possible for the mayor's strategy for tourism to be consistent with the national
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1594</span>
strategy and allows for advice and consultation to take place between the mayor, Ministers and the tourism bodies for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the British Tourist Authority. It is only through working together that each part will best contribute to the success of tourism throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is welcome that the Government have tabled a new clause on tourism. We have argued before about where in the Bill it should be placed—we argued that it should go with culture, but this is a separate duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (c) would add the London tourist board to the list of tourist boards with which the authority shall co-operate. I understand why the list refers only to Britain, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but it is logical that London should also be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase "Tourist Board" is used in subsection (5)(b) of new clause 93, and, indeed, subsection (5) requires the mayor to consider consulting and co-operating with, as appropriate, the Secretary of State, any tourist board and in subsection (5)(c),
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other persons who, or organisations which, have knowledge of, or are interested in, matters affecting"</p></blockquote>
work related to tourism. Therefore, consultation and co-operation with the London tourist board is already provided for in section 5(c). The amendment is unnecessary, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but there is no logic to it. In that case, the British Tourist Authority and other authorities could be excluded. I do not understand the logic of saying that we should leave out London because it is covered by the general proposition, but include the others because, although they are covered by the general proposition, the Government want to mention them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the issue is that the bodies currently specified in sub-section 5(b) are statutory bodies, and as the London tourist board is a private company, limited by guarantee, it is appropriate for it to be included in the definition, but that does not preclude its inclusion under section 5(c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>"With the approval of the Assembly, the Mayor may nominate a member to the board of each of the following bodies:
	<ol>
	<li>the London Arts Board;</li>

	<li>the London region of the Sports Council; and</li>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would simply allow the mayor, with the approval of the assembly, to nominate a member to the board of four bodies: the London Arts Board, the South East Museums Service; the London region of the Sports Council, and the London region of English Heritage. Like the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South and the* new clause tabled my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), relating to the Centre for Young Musicians, I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1596</span>
tabled the new clause as a result of what the White Paper says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5.189 of the White Paper says.
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will, of course, be exceptions"—</p></blockquote>
to the ability of the mayor to choose what the mayor does. It then states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The London Arts Board (LAB), South Eastern Area Museums Council, and London offices of the Sports Council and EH are funded by national organisations responsible for setting national standards."</p></blockquote>
The paragraph concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Mayor will be given powers to nominate members to those boards".</p></blockquote>
In the words used only a few moments ago, we seek to hold the Government to account. That is important because those bodies deliver the services that are the subject of the part of the Bill that relates to culture, media and sport. The Sports Council clearly does so; the London Arts Board clearly does so; and the South Eastern Area Museums Council does so, although I understand that it is correctly entitled the South East Museums Service, which covers three regional Government offices and it is expected that it will be divided to provide a specific service for London. It is one of 10 advisory committees for museums in the United Kingdom promoting good practice, offering advice and delivering the work of the Museums and Galleries Commission at local level. We hope that the Government will honour the commitment in their White Paper. The new clause will allow them to do so without pain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper made it clear that the mayor is to have a strategic role in respect of culture, media and sport in London. That was widely welcomed by those involved in the cultural and creative interests of the capital, who recognise the need for the leadership that the mayor will be able to give. The four organisations named in the new clause—the London Arts Board, South East Museums Service, English Sports Council, now renamed Sport England, and English Heritage—have welcomed our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our intention to duplicate the work of existing organisations. The mayor will work closely with them and the White Paper referred specifically to a partnership model in respect of those four organisations. We entirely support the spirit of the new clause, but the creation of a single statutory form of appointment is neither practicable nor desirable because those organisations are all different. The details for appointment need to be worked out in respect of each situation. For example, English Heritage has a London advisory Committee whose members are appointed by its chairman. Sport England does not have a similar structure. English Heritage, the London Arts Board and the South East Museums Service have all offered to involve the mayor in appointments. I think that the mayor should appoint someone to London Sport, but that is a non-statutory body that advises the English Sports Council. An arrangement could be made, with the agreement of its members, and we would support that. We are committed to helping to find the right solution in every case and we are taking our proposals forward. In the light of that, I

hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only one question. The Minister will recall the wording in the White Paper, which implied that the mayor could make appointments to the Geffreye museum, the Horniman museum and the Museum of London. I appreciate that it has been decided that those museums will not pass to the GLA and that they will continue to have the same arrangements, but if they had been passed to the GLA, would the mayor have been able to make appointments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard what the Minister said and I shall not quibble if a provision other than one new clause is needed because of the different structures of the four bodies. I want to hear the Minister say that, at the end of the exercise that the Government are carrying out, the mayor will be given power to nominate members to the boards of the four organisations she described. If her answer is yes, I shall happily withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, but I did not hear his question and I wonder whether he would repeat it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand. I heard what the Minister said about work going forward. I appreciate that it may not be technically possible to use one new clause to provide the power of appointment to four bodies of different status and one that has now changed its name. None the less, will the Minister confirm that the proposition that was unqualified in the White Paper—that the mayor will be given power to nominate members to the boards—will be honoured, even if the Government have not finished working out how it will be honoured? The Minister could say, "Yes, we will honour our commitment and there will be a London authority nomination to the boards in their new form." We would not then press the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can again give the hon. Gentleman a clear commitment that the work is going forward with the relevant organisations to which his new clause refers. I have told him that there are difficulties due to the varying structures of the boards. I am not in a position to know whether it would be legislatively possible to provide that sort of power for the mayor because there may need to be a change in the legislative power that sometimes informs their structures. However, I shall inquire into the matter and will write to the hon. Gentleman with a copy to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked about appointments to the Horniman museum and the Geffreye museum. Both are companies limited by guarantee, and the mayor may therefore be granted the right to appoint two boards by a change in their memoranda and articles of association. We would aim to that achieve by agreement. That area is not one that would require legislative change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are happy to give the Government more time to work out the mechanics of the matter, but by the end of Report we will seek an assurance that the GLA will be linked to the four organisations and will be empowered to make an appointment. It is important that those organisations are linked with the Londonwide
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1598</span>
body. For example, it would be a nonsense if there were no representative of the GLA on the London region of the Sports Council. Accountability is clearly important in this area and we hope that the Government understand that. I shall await the Minister's letter with interest. However, the White Paper made a commitment and if the Government were to backslide on it we would have to return with further proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither the Government nor the four bodies that the hon.

As I said, I cannot give a categorical assurance today that the legislation in the Bill will achieve the desired outcome because there may be other legislative organs that we cannot change.

The Association of London Government made it abundantly clear that, in its judgment, the inequalities go further and that something resembling section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 should be implemented. Although I was unaware that we would be discussing this clause tonight, I tabled an amendment to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was prompted to speak tonight by the announcement that was made three weeks ago that Patti Boulaye, who has been a member of the Conservative party for the past 10 years, will stand for election to the assembly, although I should stress that the party has yet to recognise her candidacy. She participated in the 1987, 1992 and 1997 general election campaigns, supported my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) in his 1992 campaign, and has campaigned for Age Concern, Barnado's and a number of other leading charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the announcement of Patti Boulaye's candidacy, the press descended on her as if she were the leader of a political party. I have seen nothing like it for one individual. In some cases, her remarks were distorted into something deeply offensive. 	<i>The Guardian</i> accused her of being a prostitute and a supporter of apartheid. However, on meeting her, I feel sure that Government Members would describe her as charming, delightful and an asset to any political party. The way in which the press have tried to rip her apart in the past few weeks is a disgrace to the British media, and led 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> to suggest that it is the press that is facing institutional racism these days, not many of the

institutions that will come under the scope of the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention this because, whatever people may think—and we are going to have a debate in the House on Monday about the Stephen Lawrence inquiry—the issue has not gone quiet, and it is to a great extent inflamed by the British media. They will have to take responsibility for the consequences of the racial tensions in our society. It is right and proper that the Race Relations Act 1976 should apply to the authority, and I congratulate the Government for putting that provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 265(b) applies the Race Relations Act to the Metropolitan police authority. I believe that the Home Secretary has now endorsed the recommendation of the Lawrence inquiry that the Race Relations Act should be extended to cover the police force. Does the clause give the Government the opportunity, at a later stage, to give effect to that intention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the face of it, clause 265 is unexceptionable, and any reasonable person would wish the provisions of the Race Relations Act—or, at least, the effects of the provisions of the Act—to apply to the authority, the Metropolitan police authority and the London fire and emergency planning authority. What made me fearful was the briefing that I received on the subject from the Association of London Government. The association says that it strongly supports the requirement of clause 265 that the authority be subject to the Race Relations Act. However, it goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One important outcome of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry was the Government's acceptance of the Macpherson definition of Institutional Racism as: 'the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin.'"</p></blockquote>
That I think I understand, and no one could quarrel with that. The definition continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice".</p></blockquote>
I am not quite sure what unwitting prejudice is. It mentions "ignorance," although I cannot see that people can be held guilty for something that they do not know anything about. It mentions "thoughtlessness" which we can all be guilty of in one way or another—it is not especially confined to people who are racist in their attitude. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.'"</p></blockquote>
I hope that those attitudes, which make an issue where issues and problems very often do not exist, will not be enjoined upon the Greater London authority, the MP A and the LFEPA by the provisions of the clause.

The ALG briefing goes on to an extraordinary idea. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One option would be for the GLA to have a statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity along the lines of the equalities provisions of the Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This requires a public authority to 'have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity'"—</p></blockquote>
fair enough—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1600</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and 'in carrying out its functions … have regard to the desirability of promoting good relations between: men and women generally; between persons of different religious belief, political opinion, racial group, age, marital status or sexual orientation; between persons with a disability and persons without; between persons with children and persons without.' This is the most comprehensive piece of equality legislation on statute at present. The ALG would wish the Minister to consider the option of adapting these principles for the GLA legislation."</p></blockquote>
I am glad that the Minister has not done so, and I hope that he keeps the clause as drafted. Otherwise there would be a risk that employees of these bodies would find that their masters in the various authorities would perhaps pursue policies that they perceived as positive discrimination, that would favour one person over another on all sorts of spurious grounds. It could be a source of litigation and conflict. I hope that the Government will encourage good leadership by any means possible. That involves sensitivity, leadership by example and giving opportunities to people on the ground of merit; it does not involve the pursuit of anti-racist policies, which often cause greater divisiveness and unhappiness than a more natural approach that is based on sound common sense and an appreciation of the worth of every individual in an organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause will ensure that the GLA, the Metropolitan police authority and the London fire and emergency planning authority are covered by section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976. That Act states that it shall be the duty of every local authority to make appropriate arrangements with a view to ensuring that various functions are carried out with due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. The clause will ensure that the same duties that apply to all other local authorities will also apply to the GLA and to the police and fire authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Croydon, South for supporting the clause. However, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the case of Patti Boulaye. All Committee members at some time or other have suffered at the hands of the press, and legal defences are available. The hon. Gentleman was right to bring that case to the Committee's attention, and he might want to discuss it when we debate the Macpherson report next Monday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, it would be more appropriate to discuss the matter that was raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood in a more general debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that when the Home Secretary introduced the Macpherson report on 24 February, he gave a commitment to extend the Race Relations Act 1976 to cover all public services. That proposal is wider than the clause's provisions—it would cover the police's activities. We are seeking a suitable legislative opportunity to bring forward that proposal.

1998, I assure the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that we shall not simply sit by the Association of Local Government. That is not the intention that lies behind the clause. When the new authority begins, it will be subject to the same criteria that already apply to other local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISION OF INFORMATION, ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE BY FUNCTIONAL BODIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two questions about the clause. In view of the Committee's debates during the past two months, I do not understand why it is necessary. Time and again, the Government have rightly declared that they have established a balance of power between the assembly and the mayor, but we find in the clause that the balance of power between the mayor, the assembly and the functional bodies, is, in effect, completely thrown up in the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor is meant to be responsible for directing the functional bodies that are mentioned in the clause—they include Transport for London and the London fire and emergency planning authority. However, the clause will give the Secretary of State the power to say to those bodies that they can deny the mayor access to information that he might need to discharge his responsibility on behalf of Londoners. That seems outrageous. It is an extraordinary power for the Government to seek. I look forward to ascertaining from Ministers whether it is another element of cut-and-paste legislation, and where it exists in other legislation. Judging by other local authority legislation, it seems to be a new power, which is extraordinary given the Government's understandable commitment and drive to ensure that the mayor is a powerful figure who can deliver his or her strategies. This power denies the mayor that ability. How do the Government expect to use the power, and why is it necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can assure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that this is a necessary but modest provision. It is a safeguard, and it will probably not be used. If it is used, it will be used only in extreme circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic provision of the clause will allow the mayor to obtain information from any of the functional bodies. That is a natural process of the operation of the GLA. We expect a clear series of arrangements to be put in place to ensure that the obligation is met in a sensible and practical way. Full regard will he given to all the normal considerations of confidentiality of information, such as protection of individual personal records or, in certain cases, commercial confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain circumstances, however, the mayor might seek to abuse his powers by requiring one of the functional bodies to provide information that it would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1602</span>
improper for that body to provide. For that reason, the Secretary of State will have a fall-back power to intervene, which will give a degree of security and protection against such abuse. I do not expect such abuse to occur—I expect the normal procedures to apply, on a proper and well-understood basis, between the various parties. The power is a necessary safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the chief administrative officer of the GLA will exercise a similar role to monitoring officers in local authorities. He will therefore be able to exercise the whistle-blowing role if the mayor acts improperly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, in a sense, not recognising that the GLA is of a different type to a normal local authority. It will comprise two separate components—the mayor on the one side and the assembly on the other. The procedures need to define safeguards against the mayor using his powers—which are separate to those of the assembly—to require information that should not be revealed for reasons of confidentiality. As I said, I do not expect that to happen in any except the most extreme circumstances. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the need for a safeguard against such an eventuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier in the Bill, we moved amendments that would add safeguards. We were told that the eventualities that they were intended to meet were so unlikely that such safeguards were not necessary. The Minister now tells us that he cannot imagine a scenario in which the power under discussion is likely to be used. Why is the clause necessary? Will he give an example of circumstances in which the power might be used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be explicit. The creation of the new framework, under which the Metropolitan police will become responsible to the Metropolitan police authority—and where the mayor will have a relationship with the Metropolitan police for the first time—is a major and significant change. It is not surprising that, in some quarters, anxieties have been expressed that the mayor might choose to abuse his or her position by seeking information that it would be improper for him or her to obtain. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that those are legitimate fears, against which a safeguard is needed. The provision provides that safeguard, which will ensure that the procedure operates properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect the normal relationships between the mayor and functional bodies to be subject to protocols that will work smoothly without the need for such provisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that his concerns are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we may want to return to this clause because we are not entirely satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not quite clear that this is a Livingstone clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One wonders where the body might be. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is right and that it lies under the clause. However, I do not want to get into that game because I want to address the specifics of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the hon.

	<div class='title'>RESEARCH AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION: LONDON RESEARCH CENTRE ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is an open-ended snooper's charter. It gives the authority carte-blanche to carry out intelligence—gathering operations throughout London to the detriment of local authorities or any person within the capital. The authority can pass the information on to virtually any person or institution. We know of the misuse of focus groups in government where the polling is funded. That practice, which is an abuse of central government, could be followed by local government. We do not know the end use of the information. Furthermore, the Secretary of State can require the authority to carry out an intelligence-gathering function. That is disturbing. The clause is unsatisfactory and I hope that the Government will return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My contribution is more interrogative than pugnacious. I observe from the briefing of the Association of London Government that there has been a race between its discussions at official level with the Government office for London and our progress on the Bill. It is clear that we have won which, in a sense, means that we have lost. We have reached this stage before the conversations have concluded and before elected members have had a chance of seeing the Minister. It would be helpful if the Government could give the briefest report on the progress of those conversations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a technical point, what is the purpose of specifying
	<br><blockquote><p>"Research and collection of information: London Research Centre etc."</p></blockquote>
in the margin? The London Research Centre does not expressly appear anywhere else in the Bill, although clever people, such as Committee members, would realise that where clause 269(7) describes
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any scheme made for Greater London under subsection (1) of section 88 of the Local Government Act 1985",</p></blockquote>
it is referring to the London Research Centre. Clause titles in Bills should not be worded so that people who do not know their way around the history of London government cannot follow them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London Research Centre has been invaluable, but it is another body that we are about to consign to history. It has produced effective, regular and accessible work. The centre, which is funded by local government in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1604</span>
London, has provided a good service. We would not want to lose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefit of the London Research Centre, which is managed by London local authorities, is that it has been as protected as any body could be from producing partial information. What guarantee is there that the research and collection of information will be as free from political interference as we would want it to be? No Government, of whatever colour, have set a happy precedent. It is meant to be the Government's intention to have an independent statistical office and an independent information service. Will the process of researching and collecting information be independent of political manipulation? Politicians can of course use that information, but that is a separate matter. Will the Minister assure us that when the GLA is established that matter will not be subject to the political manipulations of the mayor or of the assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate on what may appear to be a rather obscure clause. I inform the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that while I accept that the Bill is written, of necessity, in parliamentary language, the notes on clauses make it perfectly clear that the subsection to which he referred will abolish the London Research Centre—it will be absorbed into the GLA. Like the hon. Gentleman, I pay tribute to the work of the LRC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely understand the Minister's point. However, someone who goes to a public library and picks up the Bill will see a reference to the LRC in the clause's title but not in the clause's text. That is hardly in the interests of clear legislation, and I want legislation to be clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's comments. Inevitably, the Bill has to be consistent with previous legislation. If it is necessary to repeal previous legislation, that must be done in an appropriate way. That is why the Bill appears as it does. The Local Government Act 1985 established the LRC. That body will be terminated, and it was necessary to express that fact in the way that the Bill does. He will appreciate that the notes on clauses make it easier for people to understand the impact of the clauses, which sometimes, of necessity, are expressed in complex language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LRC has performed an extremely valuable function for the 13 years since the abolition of the GLC. Its work is highly regarded by many people, and it is essential that that good work continues. I have spoken to—and paged—the chief executive of the LRC, and to others who are interested in its future. I have given a clear undertaking that we want the LRC to be absorbed by the GLA in a way that guarantees the continuation of high-quality research and ensures that that research is carried out impartially. We need to protect the interests of Londoners, who need to be reassured that information on important issues will continue to be collected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood misinterpreted the clause. Data on matters of huge importance to the Government, the GLA and the London
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1605</span>
boroughs must continue to be collected. Such information is an important prop and a necessary resource for policy development. That is the spirit in which we drafted the Bill. We guarantee that the transfer of the LRC to the GLA will be done with continuity and that there will be no loss of important data sets. Our approach is vital for good policy formulation in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey seem to be making the same point. However, the clause does not appear to contain any safeguards against the misuse of the information that is secured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to come to that. The Secretary of State has a reserve power in that context. I know that some Committee members—especially the Liberal Democrats—will not be happy about that because it involves giving a power for the Secretary of State. However, we believe that the reserve power is needed to guarantee the continuation of important data sets, which are essential for policy formulation and which are of interest to the boroughs and to others. Moreover, that power is a safeguard against the possible abuse of the important power to gather information, which must be used responsibly. The Bill contains a safeguard because it is necessary to have one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to hear about the safeguard, but we are less happy about giving it to someone who could be party political. The Minister should consider—we shall do so too—whether there are ways to safeguard the independence of information other than by involving party politicians, who may have the same reasons for interfering with the LRC as does the GLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the hon. Gentleman's rather pessimistic view of party politicians, I suspect that all Committee members would agree that it is right and proper that there should be a framework that guarantees the continued collection of data on an impartial basis to ensure the integrity of statistics available for policy formulation in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1606</span>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster rightly raised the question of the discussions between the Government, the ALG and representatives of the London Research Centre about future arrangements. As he noted, we have yet to complete all our considerations and we expect discussions with the ALG to continue. I am afraid that we shall therefore need to bring forward amendments at a later stage that will give effect to those discussions. They concern the principles—to which I have referred—of continuity, the essential maintenance of data collection for London, the integrity of the statistics and the continued safeguarding of the borough's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the resource to be effective, not only for the mayor and the assembly, but for the boroughs and London as a whole, it is right that further thought should be given to that and I apologise that our discussions have yet to be completed. However, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that we are acting in good faith with a view to getting the right result, and that we will bring forward amendments at a later stage. With that in mind, I hope that Committee members agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
