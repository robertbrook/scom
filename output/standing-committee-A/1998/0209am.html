<p><b>(Except clauses 1, 2,3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</b></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be back from a brief sojourn in Europe, only a small part of which was spent on business, the rest being spent on skiing.</span></p>
<p>I welcome Members to the sixth sitting of the Greater London Authority Bill. On this wonderful morning with its blue sky and crisp conditions—even with the sun shining on the Annunciator—I can tell the Committee that we have concluded our consideration of 50 clauses.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. As a relatively new Member of Parliament, I wonder whether I could ask for your guidance on the correct procedure as to what the Committee is supposed to be doing to uphold the rights of individual Committee members?<br><br>
Early in our proceedings, we discussed the selection processes for candidates for the mayoral position. In yesterday's <i>Evening Standard,</i> a campaign was launched called "Ken Livingstone's Right to Stand". As a new Member, I would have thought it was the Committee's job to protect the rights of its members, especially in regard to the authority that we are setting up. Would it be in order to suspend the sitting of the Committee to ask the business managers whether there is a way that we could protect its members' rights?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. It may be a point of and for debate, but it is not a point for the Chair. Therefore, there is no matter on which I can rule.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Winterton, after your sojourn round the European continent.<br><br>
The amendment would widen the range of people who would be required to come before the assembly. The Government's approach seems to be a narrow one that restricts the requirement to attend to only staff or past and present members of the authority. It is not in line with—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) please not carry on a conversation with a member of the Strangers' Gallery?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Winterton; I was provoked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is probably very easy to be provoked by the hon. Member for Ealing, North, but I am surprised that it is so easy to provoke him.<br><br>
The new schedule would include in the Bill a number of specified bodies that would be required to attend, give witness, and produce documents to the Greater London authority. That is in line with other legislation that has gone through the House of Commons during this Parliament. For example, schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 1998 specifies a series of bodies that could be required to attend to give evidence
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
to the Welsh Assembly. The bodies range from the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, the British Tourist Authority, the British Waterways board, to the Environment Agency—it is a long list, which I will not read out for fear of being accused of wasting time.<br><br>
There is a similar power in the Scotland Act 1998. That power is not as prescriptive, but it is much wider in its ability to call witnesses and documents. It suggests that the Scottish Parliament has the power to call anybody who performs duties and functions that relate to the responsibilities of the Scottish Executive.<br><br>
In those Acts, Parliament has given powers to new bodies that it is setting up across the United Kingdom, powers that go far wider than the narrow ones to call witnesses that are proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
The Liberal Democrats would like to see stronger powers for GLA. Those powers should be along the lines of those proposed for the Welsh Assembly—they relate to our amendment—or for the Scottish Parliament. Perhaps the Government would go further and give the authority Select Committee powers—to call people and papers—which would be much wider. The authority, and particularly the assembly, must have powers to get the information that it needs in order to hold the mayor to account.<br><br>
The Committee has debated the issue in various guises, and the Government have responded that the key role of the assembly will be to scrutinise, to hear debates, and to search through the reports of the mayor and others to ensure that the mayor is doing his or her job properly. However, in this clause, the powers of the assembly to take that scrutinising role are very restricted. The role of accountability that the Government suggest that the assembly would possess will be curtailed. The amendment is therefore vital to ensure that the assembly can do its job properly and can hold the mayor to account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction(Mr. Nick Raynsford)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also welcome you back, Mr. Winterton, from the slippery slopes of Europe to the slippery slopes of the Committee? We are pleased to have you with us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who wrote that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not venture on to the slippery slopes of Bromley and Chislehurst.<br><br>
The amendment is unacceptable. We agree that the assembly must be able to undertake proper scrutiny of decisions and actions taken by the mayor and staff of the authority and be able to ensure that proper use is being made of its resources. The categories of summonable organisations and individuals identified in the Bill are, therefore, those who will be responsible either for the allocation of the GLA's resources or for their use. As such they must be able to be held to account by the authority, to avoid abuse or to expose abuse if it occurs.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
When those organisations and individuals have a direct relationshinp with the authority—as members, appointees and staff—or where they have a contractual relationship with the authority or are in receipt of grant from it, that will be a reasonably straightforward exercise. When those direct relationships between the authority and the people in each of the categories defined in the Bill end, the assembly's powers to summons will be most necessary.<br><br>
The assembly should be able to summon the appropriate people following the discovery of, for example, the misuse of funds by the mayor; grant having been used for purposes other than those for which it was given; contracts that had been let illegally or not been properly fulfilled; or appointments having been made without proper regard to procedures or employment law. Individuals or bodies who might be at fault in such circumstances might not be willing to accept the assembly's invitation to meet it, if the invitation could not be backed by some form of sanction. The assembly would, therefore, be incapable of carrying out one of the most important parts of its job, ensuring that the public funds for which the authority is responsible are not misused.<br><br>
It is the view of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) that the GLA should be able to summon representatives of a wide range of publicly funded authorities, organisations and agencies—operating not only within London but nationally, judging by the list in new schedule 1—that do not have a direct relationship with the GLA in terms of its statutory responsibilities. We believe that that view is misguided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister says that. In the Act that sets up the Welsh Assembly, the Government specified bodies that had national powers. He has not answered the question that I asked in my opening remarks: why is that all right for the Welsh Assembly and not for the Greater London authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will recall—if he does recall the proceedings of the Committee on the previous 50 clauses—there are certain elements of the London arrangemnents that are not analogous to those for Scotland and Wales. They are different, because we have made appropriate arrangements for London. We should not slavishly follow exactly what applies elsewhere.<br><br>
We have devised a framework to ensure the proper exercise of the scrutiny functions of the GLA by the assembly. Those functions apply to the categories of people identified as having a direct relationship with the authority. I will deal with the wider issues in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that, unlike the Liberal Democrats, the Labour party does not believe that London is a nation, but accepts that Wales is?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. That is one distinction, and there are others. We are preparing what we believe is the right framework for London, to be exercised by the assembly as part of the GLA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on that point. The Government office for London, London Pride, London First, the London Arts Board, and the London pensions fund authority, are all obviously London bodies. The proposals moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton are relevant to them, so why should they not be listed? Those bodies have responsibility for London matters and the assembly must have the right to quiz them and call them to account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, he will realise the futility of his party's amendments and new schedule. As we explore the list in more detail, I will highlight one or two of the bits of nonsense in it. First, however, I make the general point that the assembly should not have a right to summon organisations irrespective of whether they have, or have had, a relationship with the GLA.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman must be aware that there is a serious penalty involved. Failure to attend will be a criminal offence—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three months' imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed; and that sentence should not be applied lightly. We deliberately propose that the sentence should apply only where there is a direct relationship between the GLA and the bodies that the authority will have the right to summon. Therefore, as I have already said, any problem of misapplication of funds or failure to fulfil contractual arrangements will be properly investigated.<br><br>
It would be inappropriate for the assembly, on a whim, to summon, with a criminal sanction for noncompliance, someone who had an interest in London—or indeed in other activities elsewhere in the country—where he or she did not have a direct relationship with the authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister reaches the list, will he confirm that, if the authority is obliged, as it is, to have a culture strategy, and it has sought the attendance of the London Arts Board—a relevant London body—and that body refuses to attend, there will be no sanction available to the authority to make it attend?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would depend. If the London Arts Board was in receipt of a grant from the GLA, or was in a contractual relationship with the authority to deliver services, the power of sanction would apply. As I have already said, that would ensure that the resources of the authority were protected and that any possibility of misuse was subject to proper scrutiny.<br><br>
As I shall make clear, the assembly will have a wider power to carry out investigations and inquiries. It will be able to invite attendance. There will not be criminal sanctions for failure to attend but, there will be the real
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
sanctions of adverse publicity, naming and shaming and other means of identifying a failure to respond to an invitation, which is different and distinct from a summons?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Coleman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith and Fulham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the reason why my hon. Friend believes it inappropriate to include items 24 and 25 on the list—the parking committee for London and the traffic control systems unit—as groups that may be brought before the mayor and the assembly, the fact that they were abolished more than a year ago?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an exceptionally good point. There will be more about that matter in a moment. The Liberal Democrats' list is very curious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the list reminiscent of the phantom items that appear on Liberal grumble sheets?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an extraordinarily good point. The case is indeed one of fantasy summonses, which we shall soon explore.<br><br>
We believe that the approach of the hon. member for Kingston and Surbiton is misguided. It would be wrong to make individuals and organisations that do not have a direct relationship with the GLA subject to sanctions that could result in their being convicted of a criminal offence.<br><br>
The GLA will have a close relationship, and cooperate, with many of the bodies and offices listed in new schedule 1. That will also be true of many organisations in addition to those listed. The authority would not be capable of doing its job properly if it did not establish such close relationships.<br><br>
The GLA will have a close relationship with items 8, 20 and 21 on the list—the London pensions fund authority, the London planning advisory committee and the London Research Centre. That is because, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbition will realise if he studies the Bill, responsibility for those organisations will be assumed by the GLA. Therefore, the power to summon will apply.<br><br>
The GLA will have an equally close relationship with the London Transport users committee, which the Bill will establish to replace the London regional passengers committee—item 15. If the hon. Gentleman studies the Bill, paying close attention to detail, he will see that clause 171 abolishes the London regional passengers committee and clause 172 gives the assembly powers to appoint the members of the London Transport Users Committee. The assembly will be in a strong position to keep those bodies under scrutiny.<br><br>
The fact that public funds are currently provided for the London tourist board means that that body will be subject to the power to summon. The assembly will, it must be admitted, have a more distant relationship with the London Docklands development corporation, item 11 on the list—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That one slipped in.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0186">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed—because that body was wound up in 1998. It is an interesting reflection on the acumen of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that, although the body covered his constituency, he has not noticed its passing.<br><br>
The difficulties that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has had illustrate the risks of compiling such lists and explain why we have decided not to do so. We will, however, table amendments to provide the Secretary of State with reserve powers to add to the categories of people who may be summoned by the assembly. That will be necessary to ensure that when, and if, additional functional responsibilities are given to the GLA, they too can be properly scrutinised.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that it would be wrong to make liable to criminal sanctions, organisations and individuals for which the GLA has no direct responsibility. As I have already made clear, when the assembly undertakes inquiries into issues affecting London, it will be able to invite the representatives of London authorities and organisations to contribute to its deliberations—but I do not think that they should be compelled to attend.<br><br>
When the assembly is examining issues of major public concern, it is likely that organisations, if invited, will find it difficult to turn down the invitation without being subject to severe public criticism and embarrassment. That sanction will always be available to the assembly.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendment is seriously flawed and should be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spotted that this was a probing amendment; I congratulate him on his perspicacity.<br><br>
I refer him to clause 25, which sets out the purpose of the authority. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Authority shall have the purpose of promoting economic and social development in Greater London and the improvement of the environment in Greater London."</p></blockquote>
That is a very wide purpose, and to do the job the authority should be able to call before itself witnesses and documents, to enable it to investigate their role in those specified aspects of the life of the capital.<br><br>
While the Minister has noticed one or two weaknesses in the proposed new schedule, his arguments have not tackled the amendments' underlying spirit. He made great play of the importance of the direct financial relationship between the assembly and the witnesses and documents that the Bill suggests should come before it. If the assembly is to promote the interests of London, however, surely it should also look at other groups working in the capital with which it does not have a financial relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Winterton, to our proceedings and back from the ski slopes.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton accepts, however ungraciously, the Minister's point about the absence of sanctions for groups with a tangential relationship with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
assembly. Why does not clause 49(2)(d) cover the sentiment behind his comments? It covers the assembly's wide power to investigate.
<br><blockquote><p>"any other matters which the Assembly considers to be of importance to Greater London."</p></blockquote>
With the sanction of publicity for non-co-operation, surely that provision fits the hon. Gentleman's intentions far more appropriately than his silly little schoolboy list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Liberal Democrats believe that the amendments and the subsection to which the hon. Gentleman referred go together. The amendments would enhance the assembly's ability to perform the functions that the Government intend it to carry out. In his intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) clarified the ludicrousness of the situation into which the Government are getting themselves. The Minister suggested that the London Arts Board would be accountable if it had a grant. What if it does not? What if it retains funding through grants from central Government, is otherwise self-funding and has its own cultural strategy for London while the mayor has a different one? Would that mean two cultural strategies in the capital? That would be nonsense. One could go through the proposed list, however imprecise—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pound</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And inaccurate—I thank the hon. Member for Ealing, North. One could point out other examples of various bodies that could have conflicting strategies. Such conflict would be against the spirit of what the Government are trying to produce. They want a coherent strategic framework for policy formation in the capital. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have to tell Committee members on both sides of the Room, but especially on the Government Benches, that I am finding it difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman who is addressing the Committee because of their conversations. I should be obliged if hon. Members would keep quiet to enable the Committee to hear the hon. Gentleman who is speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to conclude my remarks.<br><br>
Will the Minister make available to the Committee a list of bodies that the clause is likely to cover? That would enable the Committee to see which bodies are likely to be called by the assembly. He may wish to divide them into categories, separating those that he is sure will be called from those that are likely to be called, depending on the policies of the assembly and the mayor.<br><br>
The Liberal Democrats will not press the amendment to a vote, but we hope that we have raised a key issue. It is important for the assembly to have greater powers to call people to account so it can properly carry out its functions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pound</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Labour Members are of course tempted by the hon. Gentleman's argument, and are weighing in the balance the question of where their votes will go.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about the inclusive list in the proposed schedule. Item No. 25 of the proposed list is the traffic control systems unit, a body of which I have never heard, despite 20 years in London politics. There is, however, a body called the London control signals unit. If the hon. Gentleman meant the signals unit rather than the systems unit, can he confirm that to the Minister so that it can be included when he draws up his exhaustive list? If however, there is such a body as the London control systems unit, I plead as much ignorance as the hon. Gentleman who moved the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a very helpful intervention. If the hon. Gentleman wants to collaborate in the drafting of our amendments, we shall be happy to make use of his skills.<br><br>
I shall be interested to discover whether the Minister has taken on board, if only in spirit, the force of our arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has not understood the distinction that I tried to make between the assembly's power to invite and its power to summon.<br><br>
The assembly will have the power to invite the attendance of people who have a contribution to make to investigations and inquiries. That power will be backed up by the sanction of publicising a failure to attend. I cannot envisage a representative of the London Arts Board, for example, declining an opportunity to give evidence to the assembly about arts policy in London. That is inconceivable. There is a clear distinction between that power of invitation and the requirement, with a criminal sanction for default, that someone must appear before the assembly to account for malpractice or impropriety.<br><br>
That is why we have limited the categories. I do not propose to respond to the hon. Gentleman's request for a list of organisations that will be subject to the categories, for two reasons. First, we will avoid making the foolish mistakes that his party has made in listing strange bodies—I noticed the "London Borough of Grants Committee", which I had not come across before. Secondly, and more seriously, our approach is based on the principle that anyone who is, or has been in the previous three years, in a contractual relationship with the GLA, or has a financial relationship in terms of receiving money from the GLA, will be covered, as will anyone who has worked for the GLA or the senior staff of the functional bodies—and, of course, the mayor. That is the group to which the power to summon, backed by criminal sanction, should appropriately apply. The power to invite is far broader in its scope. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been very harsh on typists this morning. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 26, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Assembly may also require the Secretary of State or any person who has within the three years prior to the date of the requirement been the Secretary of State to attend proceedings of the Assembly for the purpose of explaining and justifying any guidance or direction given by him under this Act.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 56, in clause 53, page 28, line 28, before 'The' insert '(1)'. No. 57, in clause 53, page 28, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) If the Secretary of State issues any order under this section, he shall be required to appear before the Assembly in person to explain his reasons for issuing the order.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would ensure that the Secretary of State could be called to the assembly to account for his or her actions. We have heard in previous debates about the extent of the Secretary of State's powers over the GLA. The Secretary of State sets the budget in a detailed way—in terms of capping, minimum amounts and the ability to change the authority's budget calculations. The Secretary of State's tentacles extend over all such financial matters.<br><br>
The Bill contains provisions that allow the Secretary of State, by order, to overturn and prevent individual actions by the assembly and the mayor. A series of directions, guidances, orders and abilities will ensure that the authority's strategies are consistent with the Secretary of State's national strategies. Although the authority has been democratically elected, Ministers will have the power to stop the authority doing anything that it has chosen to do.<br><br>
As the Secretary of State is to have such far-reaching powers over the authority, it would make sense if he or she had to appear before the assembly to answer questions about the exercise of those powers. I am sure that the Minister will say that the Secretary of State will answer questions in Parliament, which is true. However, the Bill gives the Secretary of State huge powers over the authority. The Secretary of State could stop the authority exercising its powers. It is much more logical for the Secretary of State to answer questions in the assembly on the exercise of the powers that the Bill gives him, rather than simply answering questions in Parliament. We believe that these are extremely important amendments which would prevent the Secretary of State from abusing those powers.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 56 and 57 refer to clause 53, which gives the Secretary of State huge powers to restrict the information given to the assembly and the mayor. Such powers could clearly be severely abused. Amendments Nos. 56 and 57 would ensure that, even in those few cases, the Secretary of State told the assembly why he was restricting the information provided to the authority so that it could explain its policies to the people of London.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. To do so would give the Greater London authority far greater say and standing in doing its job, and would prevent a clouding of accountability. At present, the GLA's accountability is shrouded in mist because of the Secretary of State's powers to intervene.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
It is important that when the Secretary of State does intervene, and prevents the authority from doing what is has chosen to do, he explains his reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Welcome back, Mr. Winterton—we missed you.<br><br>
I do not think that we have endured such wearisome amendments tabled by those on the Liberal Benches for some time. [<i>Laughter.</i>] To use a phrase used by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I found his argument shrouded in mist.<br><br>
Liberal Democrat Members have an over-inflated idea of their own importance—which we have got used to—and of the importance of the assembly. They have an erroneous notion of the relationship between the Ministers and Parliament on the one hand and local government on the other. Quite candidly, it would be a monstrous usurpation of the powers of this place for Ministers of the Crown to be held to account by any body other than Parliament. Therefore, I hope that the amendment, which would require the Secretary of State to come trotting to the assembly every time that he issued guidance, will be rejected wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has tabled some pretty curious and silly amendments in the course of our consideration, but with this group he really surpasses his earlier efforts. As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr Wilkinson) so rightly pointed out, the proposal would cause a total confusion of lines of accountability.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to a clouding of accountability. I put it to him that if the Secretary of State's lines of accountability were confused by not knowing whether he or she was accountable to this House or to some other body, that would be a real recipe for clouding accountability. It would put the Secretary of State in an impossible position, not knowing to which body he or she was accountable. How could the Secretary of State answer to another body, knowing that the views of that body might be in direct conflict with the views of this House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that after May the Welsh Assembly will have no power to require the Secretary of State for Wales to appear in front of it? Is he saying that the Northern Ireland Assembly will have no power to require the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to appear before it? Will that also apply to the Scottish Parliament? If the Minister honestly believes that the only place to which the Cabinet Minister responsible for a region in England or a country outside England should be accountable is here—the United Kingdom Parliament—and never to the devolved parliament, no wonder the Government do not believe in devolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly has not learnt the adage that many of us learnt many years ago—I apologise if it is sexist—that no man may serve two masters. The divided lines of accountability implied by the amendment would create total nonsense. There is no way in which the Secretary of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
State could fulfil his tasks if his responsibilities were divided between the Greater London authority and this House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear with me for a moment. He may want to consider whether his amendment would be in breach of the privileges of this House, which have in the past been asserted against the courts when there has been a question about to whom Ministers should be accountable.<br><br>
The amendment is totally misguided and foolish, and I hope that it will soon be withdrawn. The Secretary of State will be accountable to this House—and, ultimately, to the courts. If the Greater London authority chose to challenge one of his decisions and secured judicial review, that would provide another route for challenging him. The idea that the Secretary of State should be answerable to the assembly is nonsense, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now recognise that and withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hole in the Government's argument is that the Bill gives the Secretary of State huge powers to intervene in the day-to-day workings of the authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there are more than 260 references in the Bill to powers to be given to the Secretary of State that will enable him or her to intervene before breakfast, lunch and dinner. Surely, when such powers are to be given to the Secretary of State, it is right that the members of the assembly should be able to ask questions of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
It is not a matter of serving two masters. The amendments do not suggest that the assembly should be able to sack the Secretary of State. Surely, the ability to ask questions of the Secretary of State and to probe the Government's reasoning would improve the accountability of the Greater London Authority.<br><br>
Under the Bill as drafted, great confusion will be caused among Londoners because so many people will be able to make decisions for London, and because the Secretary of State will be able to intervene. Londoners will not know who to hold accountable for the budget. The mayor and the assembly may agree a budget, but the Secretary of State may cap that budget or alter it in many other ways. That will confuse accountability, unless the Secretary of State can be questioned by the assembly about such interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that clause 53, which amendment No. 57 would amend, clearly implies that if there was a financial scandal in London, for example, half-way through the procedures to get to the bottom of the matter, the Secretary of State could change the rules about who could be summoned and what information could be required to be provided, in order to protect the party then in power on the Greater London authority?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend makes a powerful point, which demonstrates the inability of the assembly to hold the mayor to account with the powers given to it by the Bill. The assembly will be unable properly to undertake financial investigations if the Secretary of State chooses to intervene. We are unhappy with the Minister's reply, and believe that the Committee should divide on the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 385, in page 27, leave out lines 23 to 27.<br><br>
Like all other hon. Members, I welcome you back, Mr. Winterton. My hon. Friends were correct in saying that we had missed you. It is a great pleasure to have you back.<br><br>
At columns 288 and 289 of the report of last Thursday's proceedings, I said that my inquiry to the Minister in relation to Government amendment No. 241 to clause 37 was a paving inquiry into clauses 51 and 56. I have since discovered that clause 59 should also be included.<br><br>
There is an element of <div class='img'><span class='label label-warning'>img</span>
</div> <!-- img -->, or the Husteron and Proteron club, in the order in which events have been presented. That club existed at the university of Oxford in the 1920s. Once a term, its members lived their lives backwards. They would get up, have a whisky and soda and then play some bridge. They would end up by having porridge late at night. In the Bill, the fact that the advice that various people give the mayor cannot be requested comes before the provisions for appointments and for the terms and conditions of those who are appointed. I understand that Bills have to be constructed in that way, but that does not make them easier to understand.<br><br>
In reply to my earlier inquiry, the Minister agreed that the arrangement was a constitutional novelty. He did not, however, say—I would be grateful if he did so now—why there was no reference to it in the Green or White Papers, given that it is such a constitutional novelty for advice not to be available to everyone in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
particular unit of local government. I acknowledge, however, that the explanatory notes to the Bill refer to it.<br><br>
What we are debating has been referred to as a new category of local government with explicit separation of powers. I will not go into the history of the separation of powers in this nation, although interesting developments in the reign of Queen Anne may have affected constitutional history across the world ever since. That would, however, be too large a subject, which you would unquestionably rule out of order, Mr. Winterton. I want, however, to raise one point, particularly because I discovered that clause 59 absolves the special advisers from all the attendance duties that are laid on others. That makes them very much special advisers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to trespass on your patience, Mr. Winterton, but my right hon. Friend owes us just one word of explanation on developments during the reign of Queen Anne. My question bears heavily on this place and on the way in which we do business. Was my right hon. Friend contemplating that movement which tended towards ensuring that Ministers could not be Members of Parliament because the two roles were mutually exclusive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that you will allow me to utter the single word "Yes" in response to my hon. Friend, Mr. Winterton. I am, however, conscious that time's winged chariot is creaking over our shoulders. We must reach clause 118 remarkably soon, so I should say no more on the subject.<br><br>
As I was saying when my hon. Friend helpfully intervened, clause 59 absolves special advisers from almost any duty and therefore puts them in a particularly privileged position. I am surprised that the Government did not flag up—other than in the words of the Bill—this absolution, which will prevent the advisers' advice being available in public. Will there be any form of external audit for advice that is given to the mayor?</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. We are in danger of granting a very special status to these dozen individuals—they could be a dirty dozen—in the worse possible circumstance. If a mayor went seriously off the rails and became involved in fraudulent or corrupt practices, the very people from whom the assembly would most want to secure elucidation of the advice that they had given to the mayor would be those who had a special relationship with him and whom he had personally selected for his inner cabinet.<br><br>
I am critical of the Government's attitude. They would absolve from the duty of scrutiny those whom the assembly might most wish to question. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) has done the Committee a service, not least in reminding us of his superb knowledge of Greek—a knowledge that has long escaped most of us.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for the City and Westminster—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. He is the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Winterton. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster introduced his amendment with an elegant image, as always, although I was disturbed as to what malpractice the members of his obscure Oxford club got up to between their whisky and soda at midday and their consuming porridge—presumably courtesy of Her Majesty—late in the evening.<br><br>
The provisions concern advice to the mayor which, as I have made clear before, we believe should follow the Whitehall model, whereby advice that is given to Ministers remains confidential. The right hon. Gentleman is well familiar with that practice, which we consider to be compatible with a clear framework for scrutiny, in this case exercised by the assembly and, in the case of the Government, by the House of Commons. We are following that model rather than the traditional local government model, in which there is no division between the executive and scrutiny elements in the body—that separation was not appropriate.<br><br>
We are, however, mindful of the need to ensure proper accountability. That is why we have provided for all background papers to be made available and to be subject to the assembly's right to demand information; but to provide that the staff of the mayor's office and the staff of the GLA had to give evidence and produce documents relating to the advice that they had given the mayor would entirely undermine the Whitehall principle under which advice to Ministers must remain confidential. Thus we cannot accept the amendment; it would make nonsense of arrangements elsewhere in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a little more progress if I may.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked why we had not mentioned the measure in the White Paper. I shall be frank. At that stage in the evolution of our plans, the policy decision had not been made. We had not completed discussions on the detailed arrangements that would be necessary to ensure that the new operation worked smoothly and effectively. We did, however, make the matter clear in the Bill and in the explanatory note accompanying it, and I have been frank in explaining to the Committee why we have set this procedure in place.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked about the role of special advisers, whose number we have limited. There will be two political advisers, which mirrors the arrangements in local authorities. These provisions are closely modelled on local authority arrangements, under which special advisers are not subject to the normal appointment arrangements that would apply to other members of a local authority. Very similar provisions apply in this case.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
The mayor's cabinet comprises up to 10 members of staff who can be appointed by the mayor, though subject to the normal, proper, appointment-on-merit procedures. They will be in a distinct position because they will advise the mayor individually rather than advising both the mayor and the assembly, as with the rest of the authority staff. It is important to make that distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that this debate trespasses on the discussion that we will have on staff under a later clause, but it seems appropriate to ask the Minister this now—I honestly do not know the answer.<br><br>
Under the current powers, which magnify the concerns of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, if the assembly exercised its right under clause 56(2) to
<br><blockquote><p>"appoint such staff as it considers necessary for assisting the Mayor",</p></blockquote>
and if, for example, there was a Labour mayor and a Labour assembly or a Tory mayor and a Tory assembly, would there be any limit on the number of people who could be appointed? They would supplement by what seems to be an undefined number the two political advisers and the up to 10 other advisers provided for by clause 56(1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That particular question is not entirely relevant to this clause, but if the Minister will deal with it briefly, I am happy for him to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with it briefly. I remind the hon. Gentleman of the wording of clause 56(2):
<br><blockquote><p>"The Assembly, having taken into account…any views of the Mayor…may appoint such staff as it considers necessary for assisting the Mayor and the Assembly"—</p></blockquote>
not the mayor exclusively. Thus, those appointees are not in the category of the up to 10 members who are appointed to serve the mayor exclusively. That is the distiction. All other members of the authority will have a duty to provide their advice and services to both the mayor and the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One last question—I shall try to separate the debates, Mr. Winterton.<br><br>
Would anything under the confidentiality provision being explored by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster prevent there being appointed to any of these posts a spouse, partner or relation, and on terms and conditions that it was effectively left for the mayor himself to determine? In such a case, confidentiality would be a matter of much greater public concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks ahead to clause 56(6) he will see a clear requirement for all appointments to be subject to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which prescribes appointment on merit. Therefore any question of potential impropriety because of a personal relationship would be subject to the normal scrutiny of the appointment process. The only exception to that will be the two political advisers, who, in the same way as for other local government appointments, will be appointed without that requirement applying. That is totally
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0191">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
compatible with existing local government procedures. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.<br><br>
The final question of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster concerned external audit. We do not propose to set in place a procedure for external audit of the advice that is given to the mayor any more than there is a procedure for the external audit of advice that is given to Ministers. The two are exactly analogous. We based the whole structure on the principle that the mayor should be accountable and should answer for his or her decisions. Those who advise him or her should be able to do so with the benefit of confidentiality, so that the mayor will get full, free and frank advice, can take what he or she believes is the right decision, and then be answerable for it. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his response, and am in principle content to withdraw the amendment. I want to ask him one supplementary question, which I should have asked him before. Paragraph 3.44 of the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Appointments to the cabinet would be at the discretion of the Mayor alone and they would not be salaried posts. Appointments might include the Chairs of the LDA and TfL, the deputy Mayor and key members of the Mayor's office."</p></blockquote>
I am not certain whether the provision that we are discussing will apply to anyone other than the dozen—the 10 and the two—to whom we have already alluded.<br><br>
As I do not want to make a further speech, unless the Mnister provokes me to do so, let me say now that I shall have another question of a paving nature to ask later on as to whether the Government expect the pattern that is to be established under these arrangements to be applied to lots of other authorities as well. If so, the constitutional novelty and innovation that we are discussing is the greater, because it will apply to authorities up and down the kingdom. Although the Minister is right to say that the procedure that we are adopting here is analogous to that of Whitehall, we are creating a hybrid that is quite different from historical local government. I am sure that the Minister is conscious of that, but I feel that much of the rest of the country is walking into it in a sleep trance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the two points that the right hon. Gentleman has made. Refences in the White Paper to members of the cabinet who fulfil other salaried functions were designed to relate to posts that will not attract an additional salary as a result of being a member of the cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. That is not the point I am making. I am concerned whether those who are not members of the 12 are also absolved from rendering to the outside world the advice that they are given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, they will be in exactly the same position as other members of the authority's staff, who will be subject to the power of summons to the assembly and totally answerable to the assembly, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
not in any separate relationship. However, their advice to the mayor will be tendered under the principles that I have already described in respect of advice given by other members of the authority. The background papers and all the necessary work relating to the discharge of their responsibilities will be accessible and open to the assembly, but the private advice offered to the mayor will be subject to the Whitehall model, as I have already explained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but is he absolutely confident that he has legislative cover for what he has just said? As I understand it, clauses 37 and 51 refer to the particular people identified in clause 56—the two and the 10. Is he confident that everyone else who might be in the cabinet will be protected by the appropriate provisions of clause 37 and 51?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me take this step by step and try to do a better job than I have so far of clarifying the position for the right hon. Gentleman. First, there will be the two political advisers. They will not be subject to appointment on merit; they will be the mayor's personal choice. That is analogous to the position in other local authorities. Secondly, there will be the group of up to 10 members who must be appointed on merit, who will serve in the mayor's cabinet, and who will have a role distinct from that of other staff of the authority in that their loyalty will be exclusively to the mayor. They will be appointed to serve the mayor, not to serve the authority.<br><br>
The third category consists of al the other staff of the authority—and, indeed, people serving on other bodies, such as Transport for London, who are answerable to the authority. They will serve both the mayor and the assembly. They will be answerable to the assembly and they may be summoned to the assembly; and all the background papers relating to their work will be available for scrutiny by the assembly. However, where they are offering advice to the mayor, the provision of the Whitehall model will apply. The mayor will not be required to reveal the private advice that he receives from them any more than that from the 10 individuals who are separately designated as, in effect, the mayor's private office, or cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the Minister. However, I am simply asking—I am quite certain that he will satisfy me with a single sentence—what legislative cover there is for those other than the 12, to whom he has just referred?</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that we shall be tabling amendments to clarify that issue. The right hon. Gentleman has raised an important point, which we shall ensure is covered by amendments tabled later in our proceedings.<br><br>
The policy intention is to ensure that the mayor can receive the benefit of confidential advice, not only from the 10 members of staff who serve within the category appointed to serve the mayor exclusively, but from other members of the authority. Those members will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
rightly, at certain times, want to be free to advise the mayor in a free and frank way with the knowledge that such advice will not be available to the assembly on demand and therefore subject to scrutiny. That is the provision; it is totally compatible with the Whitehall model, and that is why we have included it.<br><br>
I hope that that explanation satisfies the right hon. Gentleman. I shall of course ensure that as and when we bring forward the appropriate amendments, I give him advance notice so that he is aware of how they satisfy his concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to catch your eye, Mr. Winterton, if that is possible after the Minister has finished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had finished my remarks, and am quite happy to sit down and let the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood catch your eye, Mr. Winterton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster for opening up an extremely interesting area of debate. However, I am not quite so satisfied with the Minister's teleological argument.<br><br>
The Minister seeks to suggest that the 10, who are appointed by merit under the terms of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, will owe a duty specifically to the mayoralty, not the authority. The mayoralty is part of the authority. We have seen that the nexus of cronyism can be particularly close and pernicious in kitchen cabinets. That was the allegation in the Harold Wilson years and it is, understandably, a matter of particular controversy even today. There is a tendency for those who, by virtue of political propinquity, latch on to a person in executive power to seek to exploit that position, sometimes most unscrupulously, and potentially in a corrupt manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument closely, but I have to tell him that I believe that it is more relevant to clause 56 than to clause 51. If he rises at that stage of our deliberations, he will certainly catch my eye and be able to make the contribution that he appears to be making now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the issue of evidence, and the requirement that the 12 produce the documentation? That could happen if the amendment were accepted. There could be suspicious circumstances in which a mayor will not have had to forswear his commercial interests, and the special advisers might have commercial as well as political interests which coincide with those of the mayoralty. For that reason, it is especially important that, for the assembly to do its job of scrutiny properly, it should have the power to require these persons to produce documents and give evidence. That might apply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
particularly to the two special advisers who will be appointed not on grounds of merit through a competitive examination, like the other 10 members, but by sheer virtue of their political friendship with the mayor. Such friendship can be the most corrupting influence, which is why my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster has done the Committee such a great service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that I would not speak again if the Minister satisfied me, so it is slightly churlish of me to do so when he has given quite a lot of ground. He will remember that he said that the matter was not dealt with in the White Paper because the policy had not been settled. It is not quite clear whether the Bill does not deal with it because of an oversight or because its policy has not been settled either. I should point out gently that the Minister did not refer to the tabling of further amendments last Thursday and did not do so today until a piece of paper was put in front of him; he gave the impression that everything was now in shape and that the policy was clear.<br><br>
I am not accusing the Minister of making up policy on the hoof or of thereby committing the Government to tabling further amendments to solve the immediate problem of lack of legislative cover. It seems, however, that we are not merely moving towards hybridity of a novel nature but towards providing for Chinese walls. The officials who sit in the cabinet will have to decide whether they are advising the mayor or doing something else. That is not a precise analogy with the civil service, which has hitherto been used as the bedrock of the Government's case.<br><br>
As I said, it is churlish of me to have to have risen again, and I am grateful to the Minister for having made clear the Government's intentions. I believe that the Bill will be improved thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman seeking leave to withdraw the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I am seeking to do. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee took two weeks to debate 50 clauses and now has one week to cover another 60-odd, I shall be brief. My speech for the clause stand part debate could almost be addressed to clauses 51 to 54 as a whole, as it will deal with a principle that apples equally to them.<br><br>
Conservative Members wish to proceed in the opposite direction to that proposed by Liberal Democrats, who wish to make the clauses more draconian and embracing and to widen their scope. We believe that clauses 51 to 54 are wide open to abuse. They make the authority a court, and are potentially a serious threat to human rights. They give committees power to summon current and former members of staff of the authority, functional bodies, contractors and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
their staff and bodies that have received grants from the GLA and its staff. Failure to attend will be a criminal offence.<br><br>
The provisions appear to derive from a formalised split between the authority and the assembly. In local government, local authority councillors, even those technically in opposition, run their assemblies and are entitled to meet officers, to obtain explanations and to cite documents. In the Greater London authority, however, the assembly does not make decisions, and its members' access to information is limited. That is why it has been given strong powers that are very much in line with those of United States Congressional Committees or of our own parliamentary Select Committees. The difference is the criminal offences that go with the provisions. Failure to attend a Select Committee of the House is not a criminal offence. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think that failure to attend a local authority hearing on receiving a summons is a criminal offence. He will be aware that the Bill contains obligations to tender contracts across the entire European Union. The clauses give the committees and sub-committees power to summon employees from an overseas subcontractor, or a disgruntled employee from a contractor, and gives a wide range of powers which could be abused by potentially megalomaniac sub-committees. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister shakes his head—perhaps I exaggerate. However, the point is that a sub-committee is being given powers which have never existed before. The Minister should justify that escalation of powers, which do not exist either in the House of Commons or in local authorities. As we suggested through amendment No. 195, contractors of grantees could be tied in contractually. There are many ways of skinning the cate without creating a criminal offence. Will the Minister justify the clause's escalation of the temperature?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the assembly the power to summon certain categories of people and to impose penalties in the event of people declining unreasonably to respond to the summons. The two Opposition parties have responded to that in completely different ways. The Liberal Democrats have sought to extend the power to summons to cover almost everyone whom the assembly might want to call before it. That is wrong and misguided, for the reasons that I have already explained. Conservative Members oppose the principle that a criminal sanction should apply for a failure to respond to a summons on one of the grounds set out in the clause. That view is potentially soft on malpractice and fraud: we cannot, therefore, accept it.<br><br>
We have defined the groups of people who will be subject to the summons—employees of the authority, the mayor or a former mayor from the previous three years, people who are, or have been in the previous three years, in receipt of grants and people who have, or who have had in the previous three years, a contractual relationship with the authority. Those categories were carefully thought through, and were not chosen lightly. They reflect the bodies with which the authority is likely to have a special contractual or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
financial relationship and where, if there were to be evidence of malpractice, it would be essential for the assembly to have the power to root it out. It is appropriate, therefore, for the power to be backed by the sanction of a criminal offence with the penalty of up to three months' imprisonment or a substantial fine. However, we would not regard that as being at all appropriate to bodies which perform functions in London and which the assembly wishes to invite to discuss matters in public interest or policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In earlier sittings we explored with the Minister's colleagues questions such as whether electoral law should be changed in terms of the age at which people could stand. We were, understandably, told that that is a matter for wider Government consideration. Can the Minister tell the Committee whether these provisions emerged from the same process of assessment as the parallel provisions in the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Scotland Act 1998 and those that are currently applied to local government in England?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will recall, his party attacked us a few minutes ago for not having adopted the same procedures as those that apply to the Scottish and Welsh arrangements. I made it clear that we developed the measures that we considered to be appropriate for London. They are not the same, although a power to summons exists for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. The provisions for London differ from those provisions and from the powers that are available to local authorities, which do not, to my knowledge, have the power to summon backed by a criminal offence. That is a measure of the uniqueness of the GLA, and it is uniquely for this organisation that we have devised, very carefully, the provisions in clause 51, to reinforce accountability and propriety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the Minister's argument so far, but he has still to come to the crux of the matter. Why is the provision necessary? The Minister said that it was because the GLA was an important authority, but that is not enough. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and I have both made the point that the povision is not necessary in local authorities. It is unclear from the Minister's words whether failure to respond to a summons is a criminal offence in Scotland and Wales. How can we leave the failure to respond as not being a criminal offence in a local authority when it is necessary to make it one in regard to the GLA?</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, we are breaking new ground with the GLA. It is not a traditional local authority, but a new type of authority. It covers a large area—much larger than Wales—where there will be a criminal sanction for the failure to respond to a summons. The GLA is a strategic authority that will cover the whole of London. It is appropriate for it, in pursuing the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
objectives that I outlined, to be able to summons individuals and to have the sanction of a criminal offence when they fail to respond to that summons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. When and if we divide on the clause, will not we be dividing on the powers to require attendance? We will not be dividing on whether criminal sanctions should apply to those who decide not to attend. There should be no confusion. We will come to potential criminal sanctions under clause 54.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me, although it may be a matter for clarification and debate. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee took note of what the hon. Gentleman said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood has raised a valid point. It is, however, difficult to debate the power to summons and the distinction between it and the power to invite, which I mentioned in response to Liberal Democrat amendments earlier, without dealing with the separate application of a criminal sanction to the power to summons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have the support of any independent authority for the propositions in the clauses? I ask that neutrally. Has an independent body such as the Neill inquiry or the Nolan Committee said that the Bill's provisions are the right way to go about matters? I appreciate that we are on new ground, but we are dealing with the constitutional reform agenda. It would be better if a non-governmental and less partisan authority supported the Government's proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may take that view. We happen to take the view that we set out in our manifesto. We are committed to a novel form of government in London and we are carrying that forward. We have consulted widely. As the hon. Gentleman will be only too well aware, the Bill contains immense detail. It would have been impossible to seek independent advice on every issue. We have done what we believe is right. The Committee will have to decide whether it agrees that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

<p><i>Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I move on to our next debate, I counsel the Committee that a tremendous amount of business has to be conducted and debated. I have no power to move the Committee on faster than it wishes, but I hope that we will ensure that all matters of importance receive proper debate. I merely proffer that as advice to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>

PROCEDURE FOR REQUIRING ATTENDANCE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the very reason that you have adumbrated to the Committee, Mr. Winterton—that all matters of importance should be properly investigated—that I wish briefly to speak in this clause stand part debate.<br><br>
The latter part of clause 52(1) contains wording that is at best unclear and at worst somewhat ambiguous. A committee or sub-committee of the assembly will of course have power to require attendance by a person or body. We comprehend that, but question the mechanism whereby that will be achieved. There is no problem with the fortnight's notice and so on. The problem lies in the specific wording of clause 52(1), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"if the committee or sub-committee is expressly authorised to exercise those powers by the standing orders".</p></blockquote>
Are those the standing orders of each committee, and will those standing orders be defined by the committee, or will they be defined by the assembly as a whole, or are they the standing orders of the assembly?<br><br>
I comprehend the wording that follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"by a simble majority of those present and voting at a meeting of the whole Assembly".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the assembly can require a committee or sub-committee to summon. However, I am not clear about who lays down the standing orders, whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
they apply to each and every committee and subcommittee, or whether they are to be decided by the assembly and/or each committee. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that for me and for the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat chary of welcoming you to our Committee, Mr. Winterton, after you have been here such a long time, but is is a pleasure to see you again all in one piece—given the activities in which you have been engaged.<br><br>
To responsd immediately to the question raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, it will be the assembly's powers to summon that may be transmitted to any committee or sub-committee, either within the standing orders or by a vote of the whole assembly. I trust that that lays the hon. Gentleman's concern to rest.<br><br>
The clause sets out the procedures that the assembly will be required to follow when it requires attendance at its meetings or the production of documents. Those procedures include the time scale within which the chief administration officer of the authority must give notice of where and when people are to attend, and the documents or types of documents that they are to produce.<br><br>
The clause also provides for the assembly's powers to summon—I emphasise this for the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood—which are set out in clause 51(1), to be exercised by a committee or sub-committee of the assembly, if expressly authorised by the assembly's standing orders, or by a simple majority of those present and voting at a meeting of the whole assembly. The power to summon will not be exercisable by any individual assembly member, nor by any member of staff of the authority. I trust that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

RESTRICTION OF INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once more the matter is important, and especially so in this instance. The clause will give a power to the Secretary of State in effect to prescribe a gagging order on an individual whom the assembly would, in exercising its functions under clause 51, want perfectly properly to summon and to interrogate. Similarly, the Secretary of State could prescribe documentation that the assembly might properly want to see.<br><br>
The clause contains an inhibition on the assembly's scrutiny function that could be fatal if improperly exercised by the Secretary of State. It is a sinister power that should not be contained in legislation. It is potentially malign, and I hope that other Committee members will have a similarly critical attitude.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to associate the Liberal Democrats with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who is entirely right. Will the Minister tell use whether the clause is in line with the recommendations of the Government's White Paper on freedom of information? It seems to fly in the face of the trend that the Government are rightly trying to uphold.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood pointed out, the clause enables the Secretary of State to make orders prescribing categories of information that a person summoned to give evidence to the assembly may refuse to give, and categories of documents that he or she may refuse to produce. The powers are already within the remit of the Secretary of State. Part VA of the Local Government Act 1972 gives to the Secretary of State power to add or delete any part of schedule 12A of that Act, which lists categories of prescribed information that local authorities cannot make public.<br><br>
In response to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I should point out that the Bill is within the Government's approach to the freedom of information Act. The assembly will need access to information relevant to the authority's functional responsibilities and to the management of its resources, but all access-to-information legislation recognises the need to protect personal privacy. For example, personnel information relating to a specific member of staff of a body summoned falls into the category of information resting within the powers of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The clause will ensure that such information can be excluded from the assembly's remit. Orders made under the power will be subject to the negative resolution procedure of the Houses of Parliament, as provided by clause 272. I trust that the clause will stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recall, Mr. Winterton, that you and I were most assiduous in attending the debates on the Bill that became the Local Government Act 1972, but its exact terms elude me now. I am grateful to the Minister for bringing them back to my attention. Unless the powers to which she referred are used for genuine reasons of national security, to stop information that could, for law enforcement or other such reasons, be sensitive to the Crown, I cannot comprehend why the Bill should contain them. A future Secretary of State might wish to cover up one of his or her cronies by prescribing documentation or by exempting such a sensitive person from a requirement to give evidence as a witness summoned by the assembly. I am still not happy about the clause, although in other days, back in 1972, such provision was seen to be all right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill contains another safeguard. Should the Secretary of State wish to exercise the powers, he or she will require a negative resolution of the House of Commons. The hon. Gentleman should be aware, however, that the Government do not believe that the powers would be exercised primarily in the matters to which he specifically alluded. Matters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
such as state security are of obvious importance. The element of personal and personnel protection is also important. Aspects of people's lives that in no way effect their ability to perform their functions should be protected. They would not wish such matters to be inquired into, and nor should it be anybody's business to do so or to ask questions about them. It is because of this aspect of protecting individuals while ensuring that they fulfil their obligation to the mayor, the assembly and the people of London that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 199, in page 28, line 37, leave out lines 37 to 42.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 200, in page 28, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(ba) knowingly makes a statement which is false'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is consistent with my remarks on clause 51 stand part. Clause 54 creates criminal offences for failing to attend proceedings, and so on. The offences are triable in the magistrates court with a maximum sentence at level 5, which is presently £5,000, or imprisonment for up to three months. We believe that that is unnecessarily draconian.<br><br>
The amendment would delete three of the offences set out in clause 54—failure to attend proceedings, refusal to answer questions and failure to produce documents. That leaves only the provision on tampering with documents, which makes the subsection far more acceptable in our view. The reality
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
is that if staff do not turn up to meetings, they can be sacked; if contractors do not answer questions, they can be fired; and if grantees do not produce documents, they can be subject to the terms of the grant.<br><br>
Amendment No. 200 would, I hope, make up a lacuna in the legislation. Oddly, while it is an offence to fail to attend proceedings or to fail to answer questions, it is not an offence to fail to attend proceedings or to fail to answer questions, it is not an offence to tell a lie. It is—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Government Whip wishes to carry on a conversation with one of his hon. Friends, I hope that he will do so in rather quieter a voice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that while it is an offence not to turn up as summonsed, it is not an offence to mislead the committe. The amendment would rectify the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We support the retention of the clause. That would follow from the logic of the earlier argument that there should be powers to require people to attend, and that there must therefore be a sanction. It is no good creating powers with no sanction—in life, that regularly proves unsuccessful.<br><br>
I have just one question, which alludes to the point that the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) touched on. Why did the Government choose the present tariff levels for the offence—namely, scale 5 and three months? I am not arguing against them, but it is extremely difficult to find appropriate penalties in criminal law and people feel aggrieved if we get them wrong. The penalties seem right, but I would be grateful to know where they came from. Do they have the full support of the Lord Chancellor's Department? Were they arrived at with advice from the Magistrates Association and the like?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If our parliamentary precedents are anything to go by, clause 54(1)(b) will be difficult to make justiciable. We all know what happens at Prime Minister's questions and when Ministers of the Crown are answerable to hon. Members at Question Times. What constitutes a refusal to answer a question? I beg that question and leave it to the Committee to judge whether the clause is appropriately drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the opening remarks of the hon. Member for Croydon, South because the amendments argue against the points that he made when he spoke to clause 51. He queried the necessity for creating what he regarded as new criminal offences. Yet, one of the present group of amendments, No. 199, would restrict the categories of offence for which the Bill provides while the other, amendment No. 200, would add a further category of offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for grouping the amendments, as the Minister knows. Personally, I would not have put them together.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Gentleman is not querying me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was precisely the point that I was going to make. It sounded suspiciously as though the hon. Gentleman was querying your decisions, Mr. Winterton. None the less, what is significant is the argument, not whether the amendments have been put together. The argument is somewhat paradoxical.<br><br>
In our earlier debate, I explained why the assembly needed to summon individuals and representatives of organisations with which it had or had had a direct relationship in the previous three years and why that power to summon needed to be backed up by effective sanctions.<br><br>
I also explained why we chose to limit the range of individuals and representatives of organisations that the assembly may summon and who, if they failed to attend the proceedings to which they were summoned or to provide the information for which they were asked, would be guilty of a criminal offence. That touches on the remark that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made about what constitutes a reasonable response to a question. We are dealing not with idle gossip, but with something about which the assembly is concerned and about which it requires direct answers. If the respondent fails to give a clear answer to the assembly's searching questions or clearly attempts to avoid a direct question, the assembly's suspicions will be confirmed. The sanction in the Bill will cause anyone who believes that the proceedings are just a way of filling in an idle afternoon to think seriously before refusing to answer direct questions.<br><br>
Because the range of summonable people is limited to those who have allocated or made use of the authority's resources, it is reasonable for them to be held to account for the use of those resources. The assembly must, therefore, be in a position to require witnesses to provide the accurate and honest information that it needs to carry out its scrutiny role. If witnesses fail to do that, it must be possible for them to be subject to some form of punishment.<br><br>
That is why—to respond to the hon. Member for Croydon, South—we have made it a criminal offence for anybody in the categories that we set out in clauses 51(2) to (5) to refuse or fail to attend, without reasonable excuse, the proceedings to which he or she is summoned; to refuse to answer questions that are properly put; to refuse, without a reasonable excuse, to produce documents that have been requested; or intentionally to alter, suppress or conceal any requested documents. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out, an offence under these provisions would attract a fine of no more than level 5 on the standard scale that is currently specified under criminal justice legislation as £5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months. We have undertaken wide consultations in respect of the drafting of the entire Bill, I point out to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the categories of offence and the proposed penalties reflect those to which the House agreed for the Welsh Assembly.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
Given the role of the assembly and the purpose for which the information is being sought—the GLA will, directly and indirectly, be responsible for a budget of in excess of £3 billion of public money—these measures represent the minimum level of sanctions that can reasonably be applied. Why should members or former members of the authority—the mayor or assembly members—refuse to attend and give evidence about the decisions that they have taken on the authority's behalf? Why should members of staff or former members of staff of the authority and the functional bodies be unwilling to attend or provide papers to the proceedings of the assembly? Why should organisations which are contracted to do work for the authority, or which have received a grant from the authority, not be required to account for what they have done using the authority's resources? All those categories of people will act on behalf of the authority and must, therefore, be answerable to the authority through the assembly.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South's proposal to amend the Bill by adding to the categories of offence.
<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly makes a statement which is false"</p></blockquote>
is unnecessary. Under the Perjury Act 1911, a person is guilty of a misdemeanour if he knowingly and wilfully, otherwise than on oath, makes a statement that is false in a material particular and has been made in any oral declaration or oral answer which he is required to make by, under or in pursuance of any public general Act of Parliament that is for the time being in force. I believe that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point, and although I shall consider it further, I ask him to withdraw his amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for her answer, particularly in respect of amendment No. 200. With regard to amendment No. 199, we made our point during the clause 51 stand part debate. The Minister referred to the apparent inconsistency between the two amendments and the amendments relating to an earlier clause. It is the Opposition's job to probe and to look for weaknesses, and that is what we are doing. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>No. 203, in page 29, line 21, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) Such guidance and any amendment to it shall not have effect until it has been approved by affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 55 gives the Secretary of State the power to issue guidance to the GLA about ethical standards for the mayor and the assembly. Amendment No. 202 would give the Secretary of State a duty—rather than the discretion—to issue guidance, and would require him to do so before the first elections. Given current concerns about standards in public life—I am thinking of Lords Nolan and Neill—and the scandals in various Labour-controlled local authorities, it is important that the GLA receives public guidance on standards. Amendment No. 203 would require the Secretary of State's guidance on ethical standards to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before coming into effect.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I welcome the clause and all the amendments—the Government amendments and those tabled by Conservative Members. It is important that there should be ethical standards early on; it is no good having them late in the proceedings. The Conservative amendment proposing that such standards be issued before the first election therefore seems correct.<br><br>
Our view has always been, and will remain, that we should allow the Greater London authority the power to raise its own resources, to spend them as it wishes and to do the things that it wants to do. However, we also believe that it is right to have a code of conduct. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood explored in a previous debate the rules under which people are to be elected. The job of this place is to set the parameters, within which come ethical standards. It is important that Parliament should decide on them.<br><br>
The Government should accept amendment No. 203, which was tabled by Conservative Members, because this is controversial and difficult territory, although the Committee on Standards in Public Life is gradually working through its agenda. The amendment would require Parliament to approve the ethical standards; it should not be for the Secretary of State to do so. It is clearly a matter for Parliament to debate and agree on—it must win the widest possible cross-party support.<br><br>
Amendment No. 386 proposes that the possibility of giving guidance be made a requirement, which is again important. One of the things that we have a collective responsibility for is ensuring that government at all levels grows in public esteem and value. Last week, when you were probably thinking of other things, Mr. Winterton, and were—presumably gratefully—spared British opinion polls, I saw a poll which confirmed that politicians stand at about 3 per cent, in the league tables of esteem in which professions are held in Britain. We have a huge task before us, and it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
important to establish ethical standards. I share the Conservative view that those standards must be laid down in advance.<br><br>
The truth is that in politics in this country—as in all countries—there is a constant temptation to unethical conduct, to which people in all parties have succumbed at different times. "Power corrupts but absolute power is much more fun" is the adage. People are tempted away from the first and towards the second.<br><br>
The Neill committee is well regarded. What discussion have the Government had with it about the clause? If such a discussion has not been held already, will the Minister undertake to ask the Neill committee to consider ethical standards for the Greater London authority, even if that cannot be done before the end of the consideration of the Bill? Given that we are proposing an order procedure, and given that the Conservatives are proposing, rightly in my view, that the matter should come before Parliament, it would indeed be possible to ask the Neill committee to do some specific work so that we could have its advice before we held our debate. I hope that that is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster might catch your eye first, Mr. Winterton, but no doubt he will have the last word on the matter in his usual expert way.<br><br>
I should just like to say what a pleasure it was to hear such succinct common sense from the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in support of amendments Nos. 202 and 203. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South tabled them and, in so doing, performed a great service for the House as a whole.<br><br>
It is important that before the first election campaign begins, the Secretary of State is required to lay down the ethical standards necessary for the authority as a whole, both the mayoralty and the assembly. I would not use the word "guidance"; I prefer regulations or rules. Such rules should, as amendment No. 203 makes clear, be approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses. That is exceptionally important. There is grave anxiety among the general public that the authority could prove to be a gravy train driven by the mayor at the expense of Londoners. There should be regulations to preclude the mayoralty—assembly men are different—from having any commercial interests whatever. The relevant interests should include not just commercial and shareholding interests, but interests that could appertain to the mayor's executive duties.<br><br>
From every point of view, my hon. Friends have done the Committee and the House a service. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment with good grace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 386, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey were complimentary. I also want to make some observations about the group of amendments as a whole. My amendment is consequential on that of my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
for Croydon, South, although I acknowledge that his has a temporal quality that mine does not. My amendment is an absolute observation.<br><br>
I am conscious of the Committee's limited time, so I will not read out enormous passages. I am, however, conscious of the White Paper "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People", which the Government issued last summer. Paragraph 1.14 referred to the old framework in which local government operated. Paragraph 1.18 stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Public confidence in local government is not supported by the current standards regime for the personal conduct of councillors and council employees. As the Nolan Report concluded, there is in local government a profusion of rules resulting in a growing lack of clarity in standards of personal conduct."</p></blockquote>
I will not read out paragraph 2.18, which is about beacon councils, or paragraph 3.29 which is about the Secretary of State's or Government guidance. It relates to decision-taking arrangements, rather than to the issue that we are discussing. It is clear, however, that the Government regard the matter as a serious item of agenda. It is, therefore, appropriate that it should be in the Bill and that we should discuss it.<br><br>
The Greater London authority should be subject to the same guidelines on ethical behaviour as every other local authority, even when those guidelines evolve, as they are patently intended to. I am concerned that there might be an element in the Bill's wording that will confirm what exists now and, in the process, pre-empt what may arise. I have been reinforced in the view that we should have sufficient flexibility—that the harness should be of leather rather than of iron. I am not an authority on such matters, but representatives of Waltham Forest borough council gave evidence to the Nolan committee about the conflict of interest in which they found themselves. Lord Nolan and his committee were highly sympathetic to their point of view. There was a similar case in 1996 in relation to Allendale borough council. The Secretary of State will have to turn his mind to problems that are raised in evidence to the Nolan committee before he can give guidance to anybody on how matters should be conducted. I am all in favour of our highlighting the issue, but we should allow sufficient flexibility in our proposals so that the issue can be revisited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In speaking to the amendments in my name, I want to explain in detail the approach that we have taken in drafting the clause.<br><br>
We place the highest importance on ensuring that the GLA is a model of probity and good conduct. That is consistent with the approach that we have adopted towards local authorities. As my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made clear in our White Paper entitled "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People";
<br><blockquote><p>"A new ethical framework will underpin the standards of conduct of all—councillors and employees—involved in local government".</p></blockquote>
We intend that, when it has been agreed by Parliament, the new ethical framework will apply to the GLA. I hope that that reassures the right hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
Cities of London and Westminster that we are not seeking to make separate provisions for the GLA from those for other local authorities.<br><br>
However, the legislation to give effect to that has not yet been published. We expect to publish the draft Bill shortly, and that will of course be open to debate as it proceeds through Parliament. In advance of that legislation, I am sure that the Committee will recognise the need for us to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for the GLA. That is why the provisions are necessary. That is why we have given the Secretary of State power to issue guidance to the authority on a range of ethical matters. That guidance will include disclosures and registrations of interests.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood expressed the view that mayoral candidates and mayors should divest themselves of all their financial interests. I am sure that Lord Archer will be somewhat perturbed at that suggestion; I cannot imagine that he would want to sacrifice the standard of living that he has acquired over the years by selling books, the merit of which is open to literary question but which have secured a great deal of remunertion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not make the remarks that I did in a desire to impose a spartan standard of living on those who might not find it congenial. The writing of books would not ipso facto preclude someone from exercising the functions of the mayor. I suggested that the same standards should apply to the executive mayor of London as apply to Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and I will not pursue the issue of remuneration derived from writing books or the quality of such books, for fear that it may cause embarrassment to potential candidates for the mayoralty.<br><br>
However, we are clear that there must be a proper procedure for disclosure and registration of interests, so that the mayor's judgment will not be subject to undue influence because of personal financial concerns. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood will recognise that difficult issues must be fully explored before the final details are published. For example, how far should we require a divestment of interests, as opposed to a procedure for registration—or, indeed, for the transfer of interests, so that the individual cannot derive benefit from them during his or her period of office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to push the Minister a little further on the central point just made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. Is it the Government's current view that the same rules should govern the mayor as govern Ministers when they take up office—namely, that they can do only that job and cannot gain directly or indirectly from any other employment during their term of office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware from our references to one potential candidate, difficult issues surround people who have secured royalties from activities in a previous life—should they be denied continuing access to those royalties? As I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
said, such issues must be addressed, and we will carefully consider whether there should be a requirement of divestment of interest or transfer of interest to an alternative mechanism, to ensure that the individual cannot gain any benefit during his or her period of office, or, in the case of other interests, whether they should simply be subject to disclosure.<br><br>
Those are complex issues which have exercised the minds of many people, including those currently involved in the Neill committee. They have exercised the Government considerably in relation to our proposed new arrangements for ethical standards in local government. We intend to propose carefully thought through and precise rules to govern the mayor, as well as the members of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful; I understand the Minister's position. He might like to reflect on a proposition. My party would be happy to seek to reach agreement with the Government on the matter, and I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South would be willing to do the same. Will the Minister at least undertake that this will be a matter for discussion and collaboration and that no announcement will be made unilaterally by the Government without their having sought the widest possible agreement?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that we would be only too pleased to receive and consider representations from him and from members of other parties on these matters. I would be perfectly happy to discuss them, if such a meeting was sought, before we satsify the conditions of the clause.<br><br>
I was describing the items that the guidance will cover. As well as the disclosure and registration of interests, it will cover voting in cases in which an assembly member has an interest in a matter; the establishment and functions of standards committees—which will reflect the proposals in the local government White Paper—and the prescription of model codes of conduct. In addition, the Government amendments will provide for the guidance to cover the exercise of functions by or on behalf of the mayor, the deputy mayor or any member of the authority's staff, where they have an interest in a matter in question.<br><br>
The amendments are essential to ensure that the guidance fully reflects the new structures of decision taking that we are putting in place. There must be a clear framework to secure high ethical standards of decision taking in a system in which many executive decisions will be taken by the mayor, or an officer to whom the mayor has delegated certain functions.<br><br>
The existing local government provisions are not well suited to the structure of the new authority because they are designed to govern the conduct of a corporate decision-taking body—the council. However, the GLA will be based on a seperation of powers, with an executive mayor and an assembly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
which will not have executive functions. That is why an alternative approach is needed, and that is what the guidance will provide.<br><br>
I stress that the best guarantee of high standards of conduct is transparency. We have sought to ensure that that applies throughout the Bill—through the requirements placed on the mayor to report his or her decisions, with reasons, to the assembly; through the assembly's scrutiny role, its power to summon and the requirement placed on the mayor to attend monthly public meetings of the assembly where he or she and his or her staff can be cross-examined; and through provision for direct public accountability via the people's question time.<br><br>
As for the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. I welcome his considered approach to the issue. I agree that it is important that the guidance is ready as soon as possible for an incoming mayor and assembly. There is a strong case for candidates for the office of mayor and assembly members knowing exactly what will be expected of them in terms of ethical standards when they come into office. We shall therefore have the guidance in place in good time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment is technically defective as the Bill always refers to "ordinary elections", which is a defined expression. The hon. Gentleman's proposal for a requirement to issue guidance before the first elections is therefore insufficiently precise. In fact, so that prospective candidates know precisely what will be required of them in terms of ethical standards, we believe that the guidance should be in place before nominations open. I give the hon. Gentleman my assurance that that will be done.<br><br>
I cannot, however, accept the hon. Gentleman's proposal that the guidance should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. As I have said, the GLA will in due course be subject to the new ethical framework. We intend that the general principles of conduct, which will form its basis, will be subject to approval from both Houses of Parliament. That is entirely right and proper. That is the safeguard, and having a separate procedure in relation to the guidance would therefore be unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking that the Minister gave a moment ago was very welcome, but I should like to clarify this point. Is he saying that there will be, laid before Parliament and agreed, general guidance to apply to other agencies including this one, and that it will be done before the nomination date for the GLA? If so, that will achieve what I think the hon. Member for Croydon, South was seeking to achieve through amendment No. 203—namely, that both Houses of Parliament have the opportunity to debate the impact of ethical codes of conduct on the GLA before nomination day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, I cannot absolutely give him the assurance that he wants because the legislation that gives effect to that has not yet been introduced. Subject to our proposals to introduce such legislation shortly and for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
it to pass through the House in an orderly time scale, there should be no difficulty in meeting the commitment that he seeks, which is that the general principles of conduct should be available. However, for reasons that he fully understands, I cannot give an absolute assurance on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I express my appreciation for what the Minister has said. I take his assurance at face value. Am I right in assuming that, all being well with the remaining passage of the Bill, the electors of London will know precisely the ethical criteria against which they will have to judge the mayoral candidates in terms of the interests that they are or are not permitted to hold?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am always delighted to give a short and pithy answer.<br><br>
With regard to the other point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, we have already spoken to the Neill committee about this matter and taken its advice. It would be difficult to refer it formally to the committee and to meet the time scale that I have outlined, because the committee has a large work load at the moment. We have waited some time for its advice on other issues, to which we referred in earlier debates, so a further reference would probably not be compatible with the wish—which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood shares—to ensure that clear guidance is in place before candidates are nominated to stand for election.<br><br>
We do not intend to make any further guidance, either from the Secretary of State or from the proposed standards board, subject to additional parliamentary approval on top of the approval that I talked about in relation to the general principles of conduct and the new legislation on local government. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 386, which was tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, I hope that I have already reassured him on one of the points that he raised and that I can reassure him on his other concerns and thus encourage him to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
I signalled our intention that the guidance should include those matters that are listed in the Bill. Indeed, we included a list precisely to ensure that guidance under clause 55(1) can include these specific and important matters. The right hon. Gentleman's amendment presupposes an acceptance of amendment No. 202, but I have already explained why we cannot accept that amendment. However, I repeat my undertaking that guidance covering the matters listed in clause 55(2) will be issued at an appropriate early stage before the nomination of candidates for the first elections. I therefore hope that both amendments will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister could provide one piece of elucidation. He explained why the Neill committee cannot provide advice to us before he issues the framework prior to candidates being

nominated. I understand that. I also understand why my amendment, being consequential on that of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, will fall.<br><br>
However, I pressed for there to be an element of flexibility. Do I take it from what the Minister said the the Neill committee will never be asked to give an opinion on this subject? If it is asked and gives an opinion later, will that be incorporated into the guidance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that we had already sought advice from the Neill committee. That is an on-going process in relation to the development of an ethical standards framework, which is the subject of our wider local government legislative agenda. There will therefore be a continued involvement of the Neill committee, but we cannot accept the proposal of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that there should be a formal referral for the reasons that I gave. I hope that that satisfies the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of clarification, why did the Minister's amendments seek to exclude the two special advisers from the ethical provisions which apply to everyone else, including the 10 authority staff whom the mayor himself will appoint? Why should they be exempt? Even if they are not going to be brought to account by the assembly, surely they should at least know that they are bound by the same standards of conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the members of the mayoral staff are subject to exactly the same ethical standards as other members of the authority's staff. We do not seek to exclude them from the requirement for ethical standards. For the reasons that I gave in answer to earlier debates, we seek to ensure that they are free to advise the mayor privately without being subject to the mechanisms for reporting and being answerable to the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister's gut reaction is right, which I deduce it might be, it is one that the Liberal Democrats support.<br><br>
I have one question, which follows on from what the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said. Ministers suggest that there have been and will continue to be exchanges with the Neill committee on such matters. Will they be put in the public domain at an appropriate early stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know of no problem with the hon. Gentleman's request that advice from the Neill committee on matters that have been discussed with it be made available. I will write to him about that if it would be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has dealt generously with the two amendments that I tabled. Given that the points that I wanted to make have been made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</span></p>

<p>Government amendment No. 248.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are constantly told in this Committee that the authority is a new institution, that it is radical, exciting, dynamic, thrusting and so on. If that is so, to whatever extent, I marvel at how the Minister has such prescience and clairvoyance that he knows exactly how the new institution is going to work. Not only does he apparently know how it will work, but, in his Bill, he lays down in enormous detail how it should work. The clause is all about the Minister's saying to the new, exciting, but as yet relatively unknown authority, "I, the Minister, know so much about how you will work that I am going to specify on the face of the statute exactly how many people will work in which office and for whom." That strikes me as being somewhat excessive. Another, more worrying point that strikes me is that yet again it runs counter to the other principle that the Minister keeps reassuring the Committee about—that the body will be fully accountable to the people of London through the elaborate and incomprehensible electoral process that he is wishing on us.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I do not think that we can have all those things mixed in together. We must go one way or the other. If the details of the authority are to be laid down in enormous detail, with the people of London sleepwalking their way through the elections, there will not be much to say about it: the all-knowing and all-powerful Government will lay down exactly what will happen; we will have a genuinely new democratically
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
accountable institution for which candidates will stand, and they will be held to account for what they do at subsequent elections. That is my preference, which is why I am opposed to the clause. It will run counter to what we are told repeatedly by Ministers is the purpose of the exercise.<br><br>
Few democracies are as mature as those that operate in London, which is where the assembly will be based. In a mature democracy, we should be able to say to the people, "You judge what has been done on your behalf."<br><br>
I do not know whether it would be right for someone to appoint 100 special advisers. I am suspicious of all special advisers—they are political leeches, unnecessary and usually counter-productive. That is my own prejudice. If I stood as a candidate for the assembly, I would say, "I will have no special advisers." After my first glorious term of office, I would say to the people, "Re-elect me because I have managed rather well without any of these ghastly people. I have saved you a lot of money in the process." However, that would be for me to say and for the electorate to judge. The Minister should not use the Bill to tell either the people of London or the people accountable to the people of London what they will have by way of staff or advisers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Might not the mayor want also to appoint people who are happy to give advice without any thought of remuneration? That will be impossible if this part of the clause survives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As ever, my hon. Friend has made an extremely perceptive point, and he is correct. I shall spare the Committee for now the further issues that are raised such as whether those appointments might be given a different name. For example, advisers might be called consultants. In that way, the mayor and assembly could have those accoutrements. If—heaven forbid—the Liberal Democrats' amendment gets its way, assembly men could have them as well. Then they could gather around them further teams of people—no doubt highly paid—called advisers. I cannot imagine anything more horrifying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the right hon. Gentleman's disparaging remarks about our amendment because it is in line with the point that he makes about the clause. Our amendment is not prescriptive and would allow assembly men to choose the type and numbers of staff that they would like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point and I accept it, but we go either one way or the other. I am alarmed by the thought of assembly members requiring staff and slightly more alarmed by the thought of those staff being paid for by the hapless London taxpayers, who I have no doubt will have to foot the bill for all this nonsense. I concede that the hon. Gentleman is right. However, if assembly members want loads of staff who are paid for by the taxpayer, they will be accountable to their voters for that at the next election.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
I am not impressed by the clause. My amendment would remove the prescriptive element from it and restore an element of genuine accountability to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not have put the case more ably than my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. We do not know what will be needed, and to try to specify staffing arrangements in the Bill now is quite ridiculous.<br><br>
Why does the mayor need all those people? Why does he need a larger private office than a Secretary of State or a European Commissioner? The staff appointed by the assembly under clause 56(2) will be at the disposal of the mayor, and some of them exclusively so. The culture of employed staff should be non-political and, to that extent, I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 281 seeks to ensure and to clarify that the assembly will have the power to appoint its own special advisers. Those advisers would not have to work for the mayor. The amendment would ensure that there was the power to appoint members of staff who were answerable to the assembly alone. The Minister seemed to suggest that any staff appointed under the clause would have a duty to work for both the mayor and the assembly. The line of accountability for those members of staff is therefore unclear. If the assembly is to hold the mayor to account, it is important for it to have its own core of staff who do not have to work for the mayor at the same time.<br><br>
The Minister may suggest that subsection (2) already provides for that—he may go back on what he said in a previous debate. However, the wording of subsection (2) is extremely vague. It is not clear whether the assembly will have its own dedicated staff. It is certainly not clear whether individual assembly members will have their own staff. We therefore feel that the mayor might come to dominate the staff, and assembly members might have almost no access to the important support that paid employees could give them in their job of holding the mayor to account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has focused on an aspect of the Bill that will be of great concern to Londoners, because they will have to pick up the tab if the powers in clause 56 are abused. The part of the clause that is particularly susceptible to abuse is subsection (2), which gives the assembly a proactive function. Instead of scrutinising the mayoralty and seeking to ensure that there is no extravagance on the mayor's part, the assembly would probably appoint more staff. That would have the cosily convenient result of enabling the assembly men to have more people working for them. Those people, once appointed, would work not only for the mayor, to try to make him more effective, but for the assembly, whose function is different from that of the mayor, in that it has a scrutinising as opposed to an executive power. My right hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I also agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). I spoke
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
earlier of a dirty dozen. Let us keep that kitchen cabinet down to two people. Two special advisers are enough for the mayor, and it escapes me why the people of London should have to pay for more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood congratulated the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst on as he perceived it, homing in on what is inherently unacceptable in the Bill. However, reluctant as I am ever to disagree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, the amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst seem somewhat schizophrenic.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 122 and 123 are directed at preventing the mayor from appointing either the two political advisers provided for in subsection (1)(a), or any of the 10 people who would act as his or her advisers, as is provided for in subsection 1(b). However, these amendments would also prevent the assembly from making any appointments of GLA staff at all. The assembly's powers to do so are provided for in subsection (2)(a) and (b), which the amendments would remove from the Bill.<br><br>
Although the amendments would prevent the mayor from making the appointments specified in subsection (1)—by leaving out lines 22 to 36—they would arguably imply a power for the mayor to make appointments under subsection (5), but without specifying the nature of those appointments or a limit on the number of people who would be appointed in that way. We do not believe that the mayor should have such unlimited powers—nor do Londoners.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has dubbed Londoners sleepwalkers, but Londoners have said very clearly what they want with regard to the mayor and the GLA. We produced the relevant documents, the White Paper and our proposals for the formation and the power structure of the assembly. I know that this will rub salt into the right hon. Gentleman's wounds, but Londoners voted overwhelmingly for our proposals—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even in Bromley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, even in Bromley. I also point out that those are appointments that the mayor may make. They are not a requirement; the mayor may decide that he or she does not require that number of people. However, given the power structure that we will create within the GLA, it should be open to the mayor to appoint staff. Clearly, however, there have to be guidelines on the numbers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) referred to the possibility of the mayor receiving advice from unpaid advisers. Indeed, the mayor will be required to consult widely, and not all those whom the mayor will have to consult will expect—nor will the mayor expect them—to receive payment.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst developed the idea of unpaid advisers and referred to consultants. Consultants were a favourite of the previous Conservative Government, but none of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
the consultants eschewed the possibility of being paid. They were all invariably paid—and very expensive they were, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has studied clause 56 carefully. According to the clause, if the mayor appoints someone as an adviser, that person will have to become an employee of the authority. That puts the whole matter into a straitjacket. It is for that reason—and others—that clause 56 is too restrictive and therefore ought to be amended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. An appointee is different from an adviser, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept that. The hon. Member for Croydon, South endorsed virtually everything that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said. However—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, everything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Not everthing." If that is so, I do not intend to enter into that private disagreement.<br><br>
Amendment No. 204, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, would reduce the number of advisers that the mayor could appoint to the mayoral office from 10 to two. We thought carefully about the direct support that the mayor, acting as a directly elected executive, would need. We thought about the nature of the support and the numbers of people that would be necessary to provide it.<br><br>
The political dynamic of the authority will rest with the mayor. Indeed, the political centre of the authority will be the mayor's office. Therefore, the office will need to provide the lead on policy. It will ensure that the strategies that are developed to implement the mayor's manifesto and to meet his or her statutory responsibilities are coherent. The strategies must adopt an integrated approach that reflects the purposes of the authority and an approach that means that each strategy has regard to all the authority's other strategies. To cope with those demands, it is essential that the mayor's office should be adequately
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
staffed by people whom the mayor can trust to take forward his or her agenda. They should have sufficient clout, within the authority, to take that agenda forward on behalf of the mayor.<br><br>
It is for that reason that we have made provision for the mayor to appoint two political advisers. They will be personal appointments made by the mayor alone. The mayor will also be able to appoint 10 other people to the mayoral office. The 10 posts will be advertised and open to competition, and appointments will be made on the basis of merit in line with the provisions of section 7 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.<br><br>
To ensure that the mayor cannot simply indulge in cronyism, we have also provided, as part of our transparency provisions, that the mayor must report to the assembly who has been appointed to each of the posts, and the terms and conditions under which each of the appointments have been made—for example, their job descriptions and salaries. The terms of appointment of those staff cannot extend beyond the term of office of the mayor in post at the time of appointment.<br><br>
If the assembly believed that there was any skulduggery in making the appointments, it would undoubtedly make sure that such doubts were made public. The assembly would also be able to cross-examine the mayor at its monthly meetings with him or her.<br><br>
I trust that the Committee will agree that those safeguards will ensure that the actions the mayor must take in making the appointments will be fair and open to scrutiny. The amendment to which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke would allow assembly members to appoint political advisers or other members of staff, subject only to any limitations laid down by the assembly.<br><br>
We considered whether the assembly, as opposed to individual assembly members, should be able to appoint political advisers. On balance, we decided against that. The mayor, not the assembly, will be the political pivot on which the authority turns.</span></p>
