Unfortunately, Macclesfield just lost out in the last minute of its match against Burnley, which was a thriller according to the newspapers. Macclesfield lost 4–3, so it was a high-scoring game as well. However, I was going to refer not to football but to the Derby. I was going to say that our situation is perhaps rather like that of the jockeys and their horses as they come round Tattenham corner and see the finishing post not so many yards ahead.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Good morning, Mr. Winterton. It is good to be here for the Committee's last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 19 would impose a duty on the Greater London authority to ensure that it performed its functions with regard to equality of opportunity for all people. It would require the GLA to publish an annual report that set out the steps that it had taken in pursuance of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1608</span>
arrangements in subsection (1) and to assess how effective they had been in promoting equality of opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quickly perused the White Paper again on the train this morning, and it is quite surprising that only paragraph 3.33 refers to equality issues. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The GLA will be a local authority under the terms of the 1976 Race Relations Act",</p></blockquote>
which we debated last Thursday in respect of clause 265. The paragraph goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will have a duty to make appropriate arrangements with a view to securing that its functions are carried out with due regard to the need to remove racial discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups."</p></blockquote>
The Bill already contains clear responsibilities in respect of the Race Relations Act 1976, but we would like it to contain provisions to deal with the broader issues of equality of opportunity. That is what the new clause would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government will be able to take on board the new clause and the duty that it would place on the authority in delivering its functions and discharging its business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I address the new clause, I offer you my commiserations, Mr. Winterton, on the unfortunate defeat that Macclesfield suffered. The consolation from your point of view is that I suffered an even greater disappointment because the Cobblers also lost, but by a larger margin. As a result, Macclesfield is no longer bottom of the second division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would place a specific duty on the GLA to make appropriate arrangements with a view to securing that it exercised its functions with due regard to the principle that there should be equality of opportunity for all people. It would also require the authority to publish a report that contained an assessment of the effectiveness of those arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) for raising this important issue. As he knows, the Government are committed to equal opportunity for all. We are as committed to that in London as we are in the rest of the country. Although the hon. Gentleman found only one reference in the White Paper, it was a clear reference representing a clear commitment. All the way through the process, in the Green Paper and thereafter, we have made it clear that we want to ensure that in our multicultural capital the authority responds to all sections of the community and promotes equal opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a new authority, the GLA will have to observe the existing framework for equal opportunities that is imposed on local authorities. The GLA will be made subject to the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976—as the hon. Gentleman has already indicated—the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. It will also be expected to carry out its functions, as do all local government and central Government bodies, without discrimination on the basis of gender, race or disability. More specifically, many of the Bill's provisions will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1609</span>
ensure that the GLA gives equal opportunities the importance that they deserve. The provisions on consultation and openness are especially important in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has already discussed part II of the Bill, which sets out the requirement on the authority to consult in carrying out its policies. Following our debate, the Government undertook to consider those provisions further. We will return on Report with suggestions as to how we can more effectively carry through the existing commitment to ensure that there is meaningful consultation with all sections of the community in London. The Committee has also discussed the Bill's provisions on openness. The GLA will be fully accountable and open to Londoners. Provisions such as the mayor's monthly question time and the twice annual people's question time will ensure that the GLA is open to questions on all aspects of its policies, including equal opportunities. The assembly will have an important scrutiny role, and will have the power to mount investigations on any issue that is of interest to Londoners. That includes scrutinies of the mayor's functions, and would certainly allow for an investigation, or series of investigations, into equal opportunities if the assembly wished it. Those provisions will ensure that Londoners are fully aware of the policies that the GLA is pursuing and will allow them to hold the mayor properly to account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the GLA will be made subject to the new best-value regime. Best value will require local authorities to put equality at the heart of their policies in delivering effective services and functions. No authority could be said to be truly effective if it discriminated against one section of the community, or in favour of another, in its delivery of services. That point was made very clearly by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Housing during consideration of the Local Government Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Government are fully committed to equal opportunities and that the GLA will have to act in accordance with them. Nevertheless, the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raises important issues that deserve further consideration. Although it cannot be incorporated in its present form, we should like to give some further thought to the matter. As I said, we shall return on Report with further conclusions about the duties on consultation. In that context, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that positive response. However, the imposition of such a duty should not be viewed as impacting only on the way in which the authority consults. It must cut across all its activities—the conduct of its business, the way in which it treats the citizens of London and its staff and members, and the conduct of the relationship between the mayor and the functional bodies and the appointments that take place in that respect. I look forward to seeing a long and detailed amendment encompassing all the useful
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1610</span>
concessions that the Minister has made during the Committee's proceedings. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 20</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EU COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"The Assembly shall elect two of its members to be amongst the representatives from Greater London to be included in the Committee of the Regions of the European Union.".—	<i>[Mr. Edward Davey.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following: amendment (a), leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Assembly shall elect two of its members to be amongst"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>and insert "The Mayor shall appoint".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. It is with great sadness that I rise to make what may turn out to be my penultimate speech in the Committee. I also share your sadness about the result of your team against Burnley. My team, Notts County, is in the same division as Macclesfield and has suffered similarly during the season. We are grateful to Macclesfield for occupying a position below us in the table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 20 is very important, because the European Union Committee of the Regions, while a relatively new body, has the potential to become extremely important within the EU. Given recent developments, and the Prime Minister's pledge for root-and-branch reform, the institution could be part of that reform process. The new, innovative body in London which will be representing the region of Greater London should have a role to play, and such a provision should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will remember, Mr. Winterton, that in the previous Parliament the Committee of the Regions was included in the Maastricht treaty. Indeed, the previous Government suffered one of their few defeats when, during passage of the Maastricht treaty Bill through the House, it was deemed by Parliament—against the Government's advice—that those to be appointed to the Committee of the Regions should be elected politicians on bodies such as local councils, county councils or district councils. That was an important development, which was widely welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee of the Regions is very important: it increases the EU's democratic legitimacy, and we have recently seen how important that is. It is also, in many ways, the democratic embodiment of the principle of subsidiarity, which I think that all members of the Committee will agree is important. The Committee of the Regions enshrines regionalism within the EU, and as part of a federalist structure which is being developed. It has the potential to become a second Chamber to the European Parliament—it is already seen by some as an embryonic second Chamber. It is, following the Amsterdam treaty, a consultee of the European
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1611</span>
Parliament; it is already, following the Maastricht treaty, a consultee of the Commission. So its powers have been enhanced, and are being actively developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) is not in his place; I was sure that he would support the new clause. I know that he is a great "Americophile" who would like to see such a development in the EU, because it has similarities with the way in which the structure of the states work in the federal structure of the United States of America. However, I am sure that some of his right hon. and hon. Friends will be supporting the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) makes a sceptical comment from a sedentary position. I am shocked: I thought that this was something that the reformed Conservative party would support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause focuses on the appointments process of British members of the Committee of the Regions. When the Committee of the Regions was being developed, the appointments process was quite a contentious issue, at both the European and United Kingdom level. It was solved at the European level by deciding that the process should he decided by the member states—the principle of subsidiarity. In the United Kingdom, as I have already said, there was some debate between the then Government and Opposition, and the Opposition eventually won, so that the people serving on the Committee of the Regions were elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local government is involved in the nomination process. The European international panel of the Local Government Association puts forward nominations to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which then talks to the Foreign Office. The LGA has set down a number of criteria that it uses—such as political balance, regional distribution, gender balance, continuity of members who previously contributed significantly to the Committee of the Regions, and types of authority—and asks the political groups on the LGA to propose various members of its elected councils across the country. Each political group has a number of nominees in proportion to the votes cast in local elections. That is a fair way of going about the nomination process. At the final stage, the Foreign Office and the Council of Ministers ratify and approve those nominations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to develop that process. We want to ensure that Greater London has a specific role to play and that there are representatives from Greater London, at least two of whom are elected by the assembly. Surely that is a way of enhancing subsidiarity and democracy, and of ensuring that London's voice is heard on the Committee of the Regions. Representatives of London should be able to make a positive contribution to its debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Ministers will welcome the new clause, and that they may even accept it. The Government made fairly positive noises about new clause 19, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam so ably
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1612</span>
spoke, and said that they would return to it because of the strength of our argument. 1 look forward to support from all Committee members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Committee's previous sitting, I have been to Ireland. That has no relevance to anybody but me, save that I should like the Committee to know that I have returned prematurely in order to sit under your chairmanship, Mr. Winterton, for a final day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You alluded to Tattenham corner, Mr. Winterton. As it was you who introduced it into the debate, I hope that you will not rule my remarks out of order. Its mention affords me the opportunity to refer to Viscountess Davidson, who sat in the House as a Member of Parliament and then went to the House of Lords. In her closing years, she was the president of a body within our party—a party to which you, Mr. Winterton, obviously have no allegiance while you are in the Chair. She would get up immediately after Lady Thatcher, the then Prime Minister, had spoken, and say that the lady further down the table had made an extraordinarily good speech. Everyone would laugh, and only those who knew Viscountess Davidson well were aware that she had not the faintest idea who the Prime Minister was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She had total recall, however, of Miss Davidson the suffragette throwing herself under the King's horse at the Derby before the first world war, because she had been standing next to her on the rails. She could recount every single aspect of the event. It was a major disappointment to me that I could not persuade the BBC to interview her, as that recollection should have gone on tape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the dismay that all Committee members feel about leaving your company, Mr. Winterton, later this morning, I hope that no hon. Ladies on the Government Benches will feel any inclination to commit suicide in the closing stages of the race.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned my visit to Ireland because I cannot recall why I tabled amendment (a). I am even mildly surprised by it, as it runs counter to amendments of mine concerning the Metropolitan police, which I spoke to in previous sittings. There is no point in my saying a word more about the amendment. The disadvantage of my confession for the Committee, however, is that I would be sad to leave with a whimper rather than a bang. Although I have spoken more than 200 times during our proceedings, I fear that I may speak once more before we finish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Winterton, back to the Chair. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), I earnestly hope that no hon. Member will feel impelled to commit suicide before the end of the sitting, unless perhaps yet another speech is made by the Liberal Democrats. It is uncharacteristic of my right hon. Friend to have amnesia in this final, 26th sitting. He has shown remarkable recollection of all the historical precedents that have illumined his contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised that the Liberal Democrats have tabled the new clause, which betrays their whole attitude to the capital. They talk of subsidiarity, but they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1613</span>
happy to go along with a Brussels regional structure the sole purpose of which is to build up the strength and influence of the regions of the European Union as against the nation states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proud capital city should have no part of that. Our capital city—that is, the central part of it, the City, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster of course represents—has the highest per capita income of any part of the European Union. We have no need to defer to anyone in the European Union. As I see it, the task of the GLA will be further to enhance the inherent superiority of our capital over other capitals in Europe, and over the tentacles of the European Union structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) had the grace to refer to that glorious day when we won an amendment to the Maastricht treaty for democracy, insisting that representatives sitting on the Committee of the Regions should be elected. The Liberal Democrats have espoused that honourable precedent, which we set. Nevertheless, the function of members of the assembly will be to scrutinise the mayor, not to go gallivanting off to Brussels. I know that the moules and frites at the grande place will be seductive, but the duty of members of the assembly is here, looking after their constituents' interests and those of the capital as a whole.

The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has undoubtedly broadened the terms of today's debate by referring to the European Union. Until today, that role in Committee has been reserved for the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, although he kept his 100 per cent, record by referring to his perspective on that body. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton also referred to the only debate suffered by the previous Administration on the Maastricht treaty. The hon. Gentleman was not then a member of the House, which is why it is understandable that he may have forgotten the crushing defeat inflicted on the previous Administration over the imposition of very high levels of value added tax on domestic fuels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not going back to debates on VAT or the Maastricht treaty. The new clause is tightly drawn; I must say that it was with some difficulty that I allowed it for debate at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1614</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret the amnesia of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. However, I am sure that all my colleagues, especially my female colleagues, would not regard the sacrifice of Emily Davidson as a suicide. We are all grateful to her and fellow suffragists, without whose commitment, sacrifices, endless work and suffering of extraordinary privation, we should not be sitting in Committee or on the Benches Downstairs. I am sure that we all welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to her and all her colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, the new clause would ensure that two of the United Kingdom representatives on the EU Committee of the Regions were GLA members. Regrettably, I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that we cannot accept the new clause, not least because in two respects it is contrary to the provisions of the Maastricht treaty—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> First, the effect of the new clause would be to reserve two of the United Kingdom's 24 seats on the EU Committee of the Regions for members of the GLA. However, the Maastricht treaty provides that members of the Committee of the Regions should represent local and regional interests and act independently in the interests of the European Community as a whole. They have no mandate to represent a particular area or region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, only national Governments may recommend possible members of the Committee; as the hon. Gentleman said, the final appointment is made by the EU Council of Ministers. It would not be acceptable for the GLA to have a statutory power to recommend members of the Committee of the Regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am therefore unable to accept either the new clause, tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, or the forgotten amendment to it, tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I note, however, that as GLA members will be members of elected authorities, it would certainly be possible for them to be recommended for appointment as British representatives on the Committee of the Regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of my response, I trust that both the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw their new clause and amendment respectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I think hon. Members who have sat through the Committee's proceedings and listened to the speeches of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster would agree, he could never go out with a whimper. I hope that he will speak again. In my view, the right hon. Gentleman has made our proceedings far more interesting and entertaining than they would otherwise have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood extended the notion of a little Englander to a little Londoner. His isolationist tendencies were yet again on show. If the hon. Gentleman wants to reconsider the new clause, he should know that in no way did the Liberal Democrats table it because we want to defer to the rest of Europe. Rather, it would ensure that London was able to give the benefits of its experience, wealth and long traditions to the other regions of the European Union.

No one would intend or wish assembly members who might be elected to go gallivanting off to Brussels. I am sure that their budgets and expenses would be closely controlled by the assembly and that there would be no flying back from Brussels while sending the car through the tunnel. I would imagine that there would be clear control of expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister noticed that there was a degree of probing in the new clause. Of course we knew that there were problems with respect to the Maastricht treaty, but we wanted to tease out how the Government felt about them. Both the Minister's arguments could be dealt with if the Government were minded to come back at a later stage with their own new clause. She said that the new clause was wrong because UK members of the Committee of the Regions were appointed by national Governments, but perhaps that that rule could be reformed; it is not written into the Maastricht treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We applaud the Government's great commitment to the regions of this country, whether in the setting up of the regional development agencies, devolution or, indeed, the Bill. I should have thought that a logical extension of that introduction of regional government would be for regional government to become more proactive at the EU level. I hope that the Government will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it is important, and was written into the Maastricht treaty, that members of the Committee of the Regions are independent and are not mandated. Of course those are important principles, but I do not understand why the Government could not return with a draft that required the members elected from the GLA to maintain independence in their performance of their duties on the Committee of the Regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may want to respond, but I wanted to place on record that her arguments against the new clause could be taken on board and properly dealt with. However, I do not want to divide the Committee on the new clause, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the new clause in principle, if not as drafted. It has good precedent. The GLA should be allowed the same power to promote private Bills in Parliament as the Greater London council and its predecessor, the London county council, had throughout their existence. That right continued unbroken from 1888, when the LCC was created, until its abolition in 1986. Not only the London government but local authorities could promote Bills—that power has continued. The GLC promoted Bills almost every year for general London purposes and on behalf of individual London boroughs, when requested to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the GLC was abolished—a matter that we debated in Committee—one thing that was retained was the right of London boroughs to promote private Bills on a pan-London basis. Indeed, that has happened regularly. Westminster city council has, on behalf of itself and of London government in general, promoted six London local authorities Bills that have reached the statute book during what I call the interregnum. One local authority is promoting a seventh London local authorities Bill, which is currently before Parliament and has just received its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1617</span>
Second Reading in the Chamber. These Bills deal with issues such as cross-London parking, street cleaning, the licensing of pubs, clubs and bars, and concessionary fares, which have been one of the more substantive and controversial matters. The controversial City of London (Ward Elections) Bill is also before the House at the moment. It had a somewhat heated ride through the House of Commons only a few weeks ago. I hope that the Government will say that it is entirely appropriate for the new London government that we are creating to be given the power to promote private Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pray in aid just one other argument. The Government promoted the Government of Wales Bill in the House in this Parliament. During consideration in Committee, the leader of Plaid Cymru, the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), tabled an amendment. Although Ministers did not accept his proposal in Committee, they came back on Report with a redrafted version of the amendment that gave the Welsh Assembly the power to promote private legislation through Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, historic London precedent and recent Labour Government parliamentary precedent for the new clause, and I hope that it will find favour with Ministers and the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I in no way oppose the new clause that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) moved. I want, however, to say two things. First, since 1986, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the City of Westminster has taken the lead in providing pan-London legislation. As I said earlier, I shall be in no way distressed when responsibility for sponsoring such Bills on the Floor of the House is taken away from me and given to somebody else on behalf of the GLA, if that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second observation is that, not for the first time in this Committee, the Liberal Democrat party is a little behind events. The hon. Gentleman used the briefing that the ALG provided for us. He referred to the Second Reading of a London local authorities Bill. It had its Third Reading last week, and I was present when the Speaker read out Royal Assent. It comes as no surprise to me that the Liberal Democrats have not kept up because one needs absolutely fingertip control over the passage of legislation. It is, however, probably sensible to set the record straight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for introducing the new clause. That is certainly true in respect of subsections (1) and (2), and I will touch on subsection (3) after my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have worked closely with the ALG on developing provisions for local Bills, and we are grateful to it for its constructive approach. In principle, the Government agree that the GLA should have powers in relation to local and personal Bills. We intend to table amendments on the issue later in the passage of the Bill. They are likely to provide for full consultation with the assembly and—very importantly—the boroughs. However, in keeping with our general approach and contrary to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1618</span>
approach and contributions of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends in Committee, the mayor should make the final decision on such Bills, not the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) is somewhat more confusing. It would prevent the authority from applying to the Secretary of State for orders under the Transport and Works Act 1992. Such orders constitute the necessary statutory authority for railway and tramway schemes, and extend, for example, to local authorities, Railtrack and London Regional Transport. If the GLA and TfL were unable to apply for such orders, they would not be able to take forward the construction of new underground lines and so on. They would also lose their ability to object to applications for orders made by other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the Committee that the Government's proposed amendment in respect of local Bills will take account of the need for the GLA to have appropriate powers to apply for orders under the Transport and Works Act 1992. In the light of my remarks, and with the clear commitment that we shall propose amendments in relation to the issues raised, I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should tell the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that I am happy to stand corrected. His remarks proved the folly of accepting a brief that arrived on my desk after the sitting had started and which I did not have the chance to check. I was aware of the details concerning the passage of the City of London (Ward Elections) Bill. The right hon. Gentleman and I participated in the debate of that Bill. I was not present to hear Royal Assent being read, however, and I accept his remarks about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for her response. The drafting of the new clause is intended only to be helpful. Word for word, it is the drafting accepted by the Government in the Government of Wales Bill. I should have thought that something accepted by the Government such a short time ago might just be accepted by another Department, only a year later. However, if the Bill is to include provisions to facilitate London transport-and we are sceptical about the Government's ability to let responsibility for transport go to the GLA—we are happy to consider with the Minister a different drafting for subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was troubled by the Minister's suggestion that the Government's new drafting would give power to promote Bills to the mayor instead of the authority. It would be completely unnecessary for the mayor to have such powers—they should go to the authority, which is the government of London. There is not a government of London called the mayor or the assembly—it is the Greater London authority. It will of course be right for the mayor and assembly to consult one another. I hope, however, that the Government's new clause will make it clear that the authority and not the mayor or the assembly, will propose Bills. If nothing else, it is important to the outside world that the authority speaks, and that the mayor and the assembly are only component parts of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam drew attention to the explicit reference to the Greater London authority contained in clause 1. We do not want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1619</span>
the new clause to contain any equivocation about that. The authority should promote Bills, and nobody else. I hope that the Minister will give immediate reassurance on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 29, which is headed "Exercise of functions: general principles". Subsection (1) of that clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any function transferred to, or conferred or imposed on, the Authority by or under this Act or any other Act (whenever passed) shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, be exercisable-
	<ol>
	<li>(a) only by the Mayor acting on behalf of the Authority;</li>
	<li>(b) only by the Assembly so acting, or</li>
	<li>(c) only by the Mayor and Assembly jointly so acting."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
There is not something that is called the "Greater London authority" acting outwith the mayor and the assembly. Throughout the Committee's proceedings, the Government have made it abundantly clear that we perceive the mayor as the relevant exercising authority in respect of issues such as those under discussion, because of the mandate conferred on the office by all of the people of London. The assembly will have the powers to scrutinise. The idea that there is another authority called the Greater London authority is not valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to cross swords with the Minister so late in the Committee's proceedings, but her defence was one of the weakest that I have heard so far. Clause 29 is about who can exercise the functions of the authority, not what is the authority. The clause does not change the fact that there is one Greater London authority. Furthermore, clause 1 makes it clear that the authority is the body corporate. It is not the lord mayor of Westminster, the mayor of Southwark, the mayor of Sutton or the mayor of Kingston upon Thames who promote Bills, but the royal borough of Kingston upon Thames, the London borough of Sutton, the City of Westminster or the London borough of Southwark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nonsensical for the Government to try to pretend that this should not be a function of the Greater London authority. I cannot believe that the ALG would he happy about the role of the mayor. Clause 29 states that the mayor can act on behalf of the authority. The mayor may be given certain powers to sign something, as may the assembly. However, the clause makes the point that we are making, rather than the point that the Minister was seeking to make, which was that the mayor and the assembly jointly so acting are required, or can be required, for certain functions. That should be an authority function. If the Minister tries to propose a new clause saying that it should be the function of the mayor, we shall give her a very hard time. I hope that she will accept that although the Government may want the mayor to do everything and to marginalise the assembly, the promotion of legislation should, above all things, be a function of the authority. I hope that she can reassure me about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was truly nonsensical, albeit somewhat predictable, was the hon. Gentleman's argument that there can be an authority without any functions—that it could be merely some amorphous label. That is entirely typical of the Liberal Democrat approach to many aspects of local government. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1620</span>
whole purpose of having an authority is that there should be functions to be carried out by that authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already pointed out to the hon. Gentleman how the authority is structured and how its functions will be carried out. The mayor is the executive in this respect, and it is entirely right and proper that the power to propose or oppose Bills should be within the mayoral remit. The assembly's role is to scrutinise. We have already said that consultation and openness will clearly be required, as they will in regard to all the mayoral functions. The idea that a pan-European strategic approach to tackling and solving the problems of London can be created by something called an authority, which has no powers, no executive and no definable functions, is regrettably predictable given the Liberal Democrats' approach to local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister is talking complete nonsense. We did not argue that one can have an authority with no functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not argue that one can have an authority with no functions. Of course it has functions—we have spent 26 sittings of the Committee debating them. What we are saying is very clear—the authority, rather than any of its component parts, should promote legislation. I shall not withdraw the new clause; I hope that it will be put to the vote and the Government will be proved wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have debated many matters of great regional and national importance—unarguably, the police authority for London, the fire service for London, the transport
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1621</span>
service for London and regional development for London—but one of the great issues for many people in our capital city is that they should be able to have their own little bit of land on which they can grow what they want for their use and sometimes for their consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may not know this—even you may not know it, Mr. Winterton—but Greater London is the only place in England where there is no statutory duty on local government to provide sufficient allotments to meet the needs of the community. Local authorities in every other part of England have an obligation to do so imposed on them by law. It is because there is no such obligation in London that my hon. Friends and I tabled the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although hon. Members may not think of the provision of allotments as a huge issue, it is a matter of some concern in each of our boroughs. Over the years that I have been a Member of Parliament, I have been lobbied regularly on behalf of constituents who want improvements to their allotments or more land for allotments, or who have been troubled at proposals to remove allotments. I understand that there are about 36,000 allotment plots in Greater London and that there is a significant waiting list for them. I know that a lot of allotments come under threat on a regular basis. My hon. Friends and I see the new clause as the only remedy for the fact that there is no obligation on London local government to provide allotments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to our proposals. Whatever our different views about all the component elements of the Bill, Liberal Democrat Members, the Government and Conservative Members have tried to ensure that London government is given a responsibility to provide those services which are not covered elsewhere. Although this may appear to be a self-contained and small issue, it is not covered elsewhere and therefore properly falls to be dealt with by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of allotments is linked to planning, which is a subject that we have discussed at length. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam explored the issues between the GLA and local boroughs; exactly the same sort of interrelationship is required here. In our view, the Greater London authority ought to be the lead body in ensuring that there is a strategy for the adequate provision of allotments across London. It cannot be left to local authorities because parts of our metropolitan area such as Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Southwark and Westminster—some of the most densely populated boroughs—may not be able to make enough provision within the borough boundaries for allotments for their own residents. It may be necessary to have a cross-borough boundary strategy. Boroughs may need to work together to share allotment spaces, manage the use of vacant land and work out a strategy to protect land from residential development. Some pieces of land are cross-borough boundaries, by definition. That may be better dealt with by a Londonwide strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two other arguments in favour of the new clause. The Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs produced a report called
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1622</span>
"The Future for Allotments" only nine months ago in June 1998. Unusually, it had an extraordinarily glossy and pictorial cover, such as I had never seen before. The Select Committee made it clear that all sorts of issues are not being adequately addressed. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe there is a need for urgent action to protect existing allotment sites."</p></blockquote>
It recommended having a provision that simplifies, updates and enhances existing allotments legislation. It said that there needs to be more explicit planning guidance
	<br><blockquote><p>"particularly since allotment land is the principal category of urban green space which is being eroded."</p></blockquote>
It recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'statutory' allotment sites should be clearly designated within Unitary Development Plans and Local Plans. 'Temporary' sites should be marked with their final intended use along with an approximate date for the change of use."</p></blockquote>
It also recommended that there should be guidance on the role of allotments. Above all, the Committee made it clear that there needs to be clear designation and procedures on proposals for sale and also on apparently small matters-the sort of things that my constituents come to me about, such as the provision of water and adequate fencing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the GLA should be responsible for those things?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being difficult, as he frequently is. Perhaps he does not think that people in his borough are interested in this. I challenge him to talk to all the people with allotments in Harrow and find out what demand there is. Then he would know that people with allotments are concerned that there should be running water and fencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because there is at present no borough responsibility, we have a chance, through the Bill, to develop a strategy and ensure that there is a responsible authority. There is a horticultural society in Bermondsey and Rotherhithe that has been badly served by the local authority, partly because it has no responsibility. 	<i>[Interruption]</i> Does the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) want to intervene? If so, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Siobhain McDonagh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mitcham and Morden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I began my political career on the allotment sub-committee of Merton borough council. I say to the hon.

The local authority attempts to do a good job in promoting allotments, looking after them and encouraging people to take them. The problem is that people just do not want them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. I am sorry that I put the hon.

This is exactly why we need a London-wide approach. If the hon. Lady's borough, which I do not know well, has a surplus of allotment provision, and my borough, which I know well, has a deficit, there may be scope for making sure that, between us, we have enough provision across London. If London is not going to have enough land in one place, there needs to be a London-wide approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Internationalist speaks again. I would have hoped that by the end of this Committee, he would have taken a more Londonwide view of life. The answer is in the new clause, if the hon. Gentleman would read it. It is a simple proposal of words of one syllable, almost. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Greater London Authority shall be responsible for preparing a strategy for the provision of sufficient allotments to meet all reasonable demand in Greater London."</p></blockquote>
As there is insufficient provision at present in some parts of London, someone needs to address the issue. The Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs recommended that that should be dealt with. The Government accepted the need for action; we are taking the first legislative opportunity to ensure that something is done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good the hon. Gentleman, pointing at the new clause. It is not for us to prescribe the detail; the Government have often resisted that elsewhere. The hon. Gentleman has argued against overprescriptive provisions. The proposal is simple: allotments that are not the responsibility of local government should be the responsibility of London government. If the hon. Gentleman does not support that, I hope that he will put that on record, because I am sure that his constituents will be interested. I hope that the Committee will support the new clause, so that it can at least be further considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first came to London, I lived next door to an allotment—not in Merton, but in Richmond, just down the road. I have no doubt that the value of allotments to city and urban dwellers is much appreciated. However, the Liberal Democrats are wrong on this occasion. The mayor is the wrong person to be deciding strategy on allotments. The London boroughs, for which our party is prepared to stand up, should draw up that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled by the Liberal Democrat approach because a new clause that you did not select, Mr. Winterton, called for parish councils to be established in London. I am sure that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will be aware of the Government's proposals in response to the Select Committee report that parish councils take over allotments. I therefore find it odd that just when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1624</span>
allotment policy is being allocated to parish councils, the hon. Gentleman should propose that it should go the mayoral level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman says, there is a Select Committee report, in an unusually glossy cover. In it lies the key to a possible compromise between the Government and the Liberal Democrats, it proposes that PPG3 for London and the unitary development plans be amended to take on board an allotment strategy at borough level. Boroughs draw up UDPS, but—this is the compromise—they must conform with the mayor's spatial development strategy. The decision should be made at borough level; it is not for the mayor to tell boroughs how to draw up their UDPs. That is where the Liberal Democrats are wrong, and where we differ from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down, I wonder whether I may be allowed to tell my short football story of the day, Mr. Winterton. Prompted by the story that Macclesfield lost 4-3, I am reminded of the occasion on which Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 6-1 at Crystal Palace. The editor of the 	<i>Croydon Advertiser,</i> who is a passionate football fan, returned to the office to see how the sports sub-editor had written it up. The headline read: "Palace Get Six of the Best". He put a line through it and changed it to "Palace in Seven-Goal Thriller". I suggest that the editor of the Macclesfield paper writes up his story similarly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McDonnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hayes and Harlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Points have been made largely by the representative of allotments in Croydon, South. Many of us will have much sympathy with the principles and intent of the new clause, but a point has correctly been made about the rightful locus for decision making on these issues. As a former allotment holder and someone who is organising a seminar on allotments in my constituency, I did not want the Liberal Democrats to be seen as the only champions of allotment holders—especially as their relationship to gardening is probably listening to "The Archers" once a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee report was excellent and made a number of detailed recommendations. As I see it, the current position with regard to the Government's allotment proposals is that there is an understanding of the possible need to legislate on the responsibility to promote allotments, but at the appropriate level of local government. That may well be parish or borough level, but I would not have thought that it would be above that. However, any proposals from the boroughs or parishes would have to be linked to the overall strategy on the environment which the mayor will have to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, in advance of any legislation or the potential for legislation, there is an on-going discussion with the Local Government Association on guidance and codes of practice. As yet, the outcome has not been agreed or even tested as workable. If at some stage we discovered that the guidance and codes of practice developed by the LGA on behalf of the boroughs and other local authorities across the country were not practical or workable, I hope that the Government would legislate to ensure that the responsibility for promotion and protection was with the boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1625</span>
I have some sympathy with the development of parish councils within London. Perhaps they will come to reflect the old urban district council structure, which was below the boroughs and existed before the boroughs came about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest as the tenant of an allotment in the London borough of Hillingdon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be concluding the Committee's proceedings as we began, because the devil is in the detail—this time in the horticultural detail. I had hoped that the Liberal party would rise above such matters and perhaps join us—as, sadly, bombs are falling on Serbia—in digging for victory. But no, they are digging for detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have not even produced a new clause that makes sense. How will the Greater London authority meet "all reasonable demand"? Who will judge what "reasonable demand" is? My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) made it clear that the boroughs are the eminently appropriate bodies. I do not see how a spatial development strategy could sensibly cover allotments. Furthermore, the proposal would be inherently bureaucratic, inasmuch as it would take the preparation of a strategy from the local level—the borough or perhaps even a parish—up to the mayoralty, which is clearly crazy. If the mayor is to have a responsibility, perhaps it should be to visit allotments from time to time to present awards. In that case, who knows—the mayor might some day award a trophy for the prize turnip to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pick up on some of the comments of the hon. Member for Croydon, South and some Labour Members. It is entirely right that until London is parished and we can elect parish councils to deal with local matters affecting the lives of Londoners, the operational issues affecting the running of allotments, their precise location and their equipping are properly in the realm of local government—that is, the London boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The location of allotments, however, and the general sufficiency of their provision across London ought to be dealt with through the spatial development strategy, not least because of the intensification of pressure on the use of land in Greater London. That will arise, at least in part, because of the Government's understandable desire for greater densities of urban living to promote sustainability in Greater London. Therefore, an SDS needs to include policies that give guidance to local authorities on drawing up their UDPs in respect also of allotments. That would ensure that authorities safeguard allotments, and that they play a part in the sustainable development of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was absolutely right to have tabled the new clause. It is, however, also the case that London boroughs should conduct the management, running and provision of allotments until parishes come to London.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1626</span>
The mayor and the assembly should provide the overall strategy for such issues, just as happens with other matters that are dealt with through the SDS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to wonder whether the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood would grow brussels if he had an allotment. When we look back on our proceedings, we will probably see that the new clause has taken up more time than many far more important things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rose for two reasons. First, I want to counter the typically juvenile approach of the hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He seemed to suggest that if we were against his pretty little clause, we were somehow against allotments in London. That is facile, but not untypical. In Harrow, there is a vibrant allotment users group, which uses allotments to some degree. There is, however, an intense surplus. Whatever happens, however, matters must be dealt with at borough level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Liberal Democrats had got beyond such things, but they really have reached the depths when they legislate on the basis that things have not happened at the appropriate level in the way that they want, so they will stick something in the Bill until they get something better. If that is their approach to legislation, thank heaven that they have never come anywhere close to running this nation. I would warn colleagues who dabble with them in other, assorted regional forums that that is an incredibly fatuous approach to any legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the arguments about parish councils, and I am not convinced by them in regard to London. As regards basing parish boundaries on old urban district councils, the old UDC boundaries are, uniquely for Harrow, the current borough boundaries. That would not be the approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion that allotment users should somehow be bussed from the depths of Deptford and Millwall out to Kent and Harrow Weald is absolute nonsense. So, too, is the idea that someone sitting in what my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) calls the glass testicle should determine whether we retain allotments in west Harrow or Harrow Weald. The same goes for the idea that—if the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has his way—such a person could determine the sort of fencing around allotments and whether water was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to the last amendment in our proceedings, I hope that we will accept the Liberals' foresight and take the amendment on board. It really shows the level that they are at—they have managed to spot that an "h" has fallen out of a "which". The word "wich" is in the Bill, and they have amended it to "which". That is the extent of their assistance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are coming to that amendment. I hope that we can deal with the present matter as quickly as we will deal with that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That amendment reflects the extent of the Liberal Democrats' support and helpful approach to the Bill. The new clause is absolute nonsense and should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) in his comments on the new clause, which is a classic Liberal Democrat new clause. It responds famously to Professor Parkinson's observation that the nuclear device goes through on the nod and that we then have a long argument about the bicycle shed. The bicycle shed has already played a part in one of my comments on an earlier Liberal Democrat amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sufficiently prudent to make it clear that I am not against allotments. I also have no intention of getting into a discussion about the other uses of outer London space for inner London boroughs. I am mindful of a letter that appeared in 	<i>The Times</i> after Lady Porter had sold some cemeteries. The correspondent to 	<i>The Times</i> wrote to the editor, "We shall look back on this as a golden age where you can go up to town with half a sovereign and buy three cemeteries and a copy of your noble paper."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that this is a classic Liberal Democrat new clause. It is also an example of classic symmetry. During the Committee's first sitting I referred to the Local Government, Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill of nearly 20 years ago. During the proceedings of the Committee that considered that Bill, we heard massive eloquence from Lord Hattersley on the subject of allotments and how totally improper were the Government's proposals for them. The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) has just driven an Exocet through the arguments that Lord Hattersley deployed. Having waited for nearly 20 years, I shall have great pleasure in telling my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King), who led for the Government in that Committee, that he was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As on every other occasion, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South on the admirable way in which he has led for the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to put the record straight on the speech by the hon. Member for Harrow, East. As usual, it was peppered with references to "facile" and "fatuous" comments and, as usual, failed to make his case. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam had dealt with all the hon. Gentleman's arguments, but he had clearly failed to listen to what my hon. Friend said. That made his contribution to the Committee of even lower quality than that to which we have become accustomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the new clause that hon. Members are failing to appreciate is that it could result in a much greater take-up of allotments across the capital. I should declare an interest—I am, like the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, a member of the Maiden and Coombe horticultural society. Last year, I had the pleasure of awarding the prizes at its spring event. I have learnt from my dealings with the society how valuable is the work that it does, and how valuable allotments in Kingston are to that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a few allotments in Kingston that are not used, and the society would be delighted to see them in use because it would enhance the work that it does and ensure that those allotments are protected for the future. It would be eminently sensible if a Londonwide strategy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1628</span>
could be developed to ensure that surpluses could be shared out with boroughs, such as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, where there are deficits. That is why we tabled the new clause. I am sorry that this sensible, practical way forward, which was intended to safeguard the future of allotments in central London, has failed to catch the attention of Committee members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting new clause in that, like many things that Liberal Democrat Members bring before the Committee and, indeed, before the world, there is within its great, composted mass, a scintilla of sense and sanity. It contains a miniscule point that is worthy of consideration by my hon. Friend the Minister when she responds: that is, that a central register or list of availability of what we in west London call leisure gardens—I am myself a plot holder—is not a bad idea, because there is a problem of supply and demand. However, we do not need a measure of the type of new clause 102.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own leisure garden is amply serviced by a very good composter called the "little rotter", which has existed for many years on a diet of Liberal Democrat newsletters. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Consequently, the quality of the tilth is so exquisite that I could probably grow mangos on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many members of the Committee will know, the one committee of every council that had to exist by statute was the allotment committee. There did not have to be a housing committee or a social services committee, but there had to be an allotments committee. My first days on the council were on the allotments committee as second substitute. It was the peak of my civic achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some interesting points here. It is worth putting on the record that those of us in London, even in outer London, treasure and value allotments. In fact, I know someone who operates a golf club on his. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friend the Minister, who may already be inclined to do so, to consign this proposal to the little rotter. However, the idea of having a central list or register might be a sensible and sane solution, despite the fact that it originates from the compost heap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I refer to my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden, the hon. Member for Croydon, South, my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell), the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, my hon. Friend the Member for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1629</span>
Harrow, East, the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound). Their contributions, based as they were on a clear foundation of knowledge of the situation regarding allotments in their own constituencies, totally refuted the argument of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that local authorities in London have no interest in, or commitment to, allotments or allotment holders. The contributions of the various members of the Committee not only set the record straight but afforded a great deal of amusement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of allotments to London and Londoners is undoubted. There are practical difficulties, because allotments are not always where people would like them to be. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North spoke about the possibility of a central registry of allotments, highlighting those that were available, and that that should be devised by the boroughs for the boroughs. I hope that the boroughs would examine such a proposal. However, there are clearly practical difficulties in such a proposal, not only in the distances that might have to be travelled from one borough to another by the would-be allotment holder. But as we are considering making ever greater use of our inner cities and urban environment, it would surely be wrong to take away from the future residents of a particular borough the possibility of having an allotment because it had been given to a resident of another borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is central and essential to all the arguments that contested the proposals of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and the Liberal Democrats is that to remove from the powers of the local authorities the decisions with regard to allotments and their apportionment—how they can best be advertised to local residents, and how local residents can be encouraged to take them on—and to put such decisions in the hands of the mayor is absurd. It is particularly absurd given that it comes from a party that has always claimed a deep and overriding commitment to the principles of subsidiarity, yet now appears to wish to remove this decision-making process from local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much reference has been made to the excellent report by the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs on the important issues of allotments and allotment provision. The committee concluded that allotment provision should be subject to local decision-making. The Government strongly agree with that conclusion. We totally refute the arguments of the Liberal Democrat party. We hope that in the light of what has been virtually a consensus of opposition to the proposal, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the interest shown in the issue. That has been reflected, and I shall seek to make my remarks about the way forward consensual across the Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South said that when he first came to London he lived next to an allotment. He is overtaken in his claim for proximity only by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1630</span>
predecessor of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, who contributed to a debate on London docklands when she was a Member of Parliament. She said something like, "My claim to speak in this debate is that I very recently flew over docklands, and I therefore think that I have something appropriate to say about it".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a broomstick?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She did not say in or on what. Anyway, she has now flown back, and has not been seen recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument was never that London government should take responsibility for the provision of allotments. It is very simply that because specific London boroughs do not have adequate provision as has been shown by the hon. Members for Harrow, East and for Mitcham and Morden and others, other boroughs have a surplus, there is logic in trying to consider the matter on a Londonwide basis. I have heard no argument against that approach. The very welcome Select Committee report—the Minister was right about this—came up with a recommendation. Paragraph 110 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were disappointed to be told by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State that allotments are essentially a local issue. We believe that the provision of allotments is a national issue."</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words, but those of the Select Committee. If provision of allotments is a national issue, by definition it must also be a regional issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington, who said that we will need to find the best level at which such matters should be managed. That is a growing view in London, and is probably a majority view in Committees such as this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London should have another tier of government, which, as with allotments, is the one thing that it cannot have; it should have a parish and community council tier. You will be aware, Mr. Winterton, that a proposal for such a tier was tabled for your consideration in the hope that it might be selected for debate. You ruled that it fell outwith the scope of the Bill. I am sure, however, that the hon. Members will return to the matter. There are functions appropriate for a parish and community council, one of which might be the management of allotments. Liberal Democrat Members did not and do not argue that allotments should be managed at a local level; we simply believe that a strategic view of such matters should be decided on a Londonwide basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's suggestion that there is a strong view against the proposal, I am encouraged by her recognition that the issue that it raises is important. I hope that the Government will speedily consider the Select Committee report and the reply—the Mininster's Department is the one involved. I hope that we will ensure that allotments are more secure, better used and better supported in the days ahead than they have been in the past. On the understanding that that is the way in which the Committee wants to proceed, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise you, Mr. Winterton, that I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes no reference to the London Pension Fund Authority. The Minister sent us all a letter on 24 March containing frequent references to financial provisions—which is what the clause is about—and to pension arrangements. Although the Minister indicated that the Government would be tabling new amendments, as we are in Committee, I should like to raise a brief question, to which he might be able to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London Pension Fund Authority deals mainly with the pension arrangements of ex-GLC and ex-ILEA staff, as well as administering pensions on behalf of the London fire and civil defence authority and a few London boroughs. However, there is no mention of that authority in the Bill. The Government stated in answer to a written question on 24 March that they intended to table amendments providing for the GLA to take on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1632</span>
responsibility for the authority. As I am an honest man, I have to say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that I have not yet seen the Government's written answer; I must plead that I have been away in Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear how the extra cost of the proposal will be funded—no amendment has yet been tabled. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister could clarify how any extra costs would be funded and how the accumulated pension costs of civil servants transferring to the GLA will be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The London Pension Fund Authority, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, has done an extremely effective job in looking after the interests of former GLC pensioners and others from the bodies that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. It is a cost-effective and well-run operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the London Pension Fund Authority should come within the ambit of the new Greater London authority. However, we wish to see the minimum disruption of an operation that is working effectively and well; we therefore propose to table an amendment at a later stage bringing the LPFA within the framework of the GLA. Any financial implications will be spelled out then. I must point out to the right hon. Gentleman that the LPFA, with which I have had quite regular contact, is extremely well and efficiently run and its costs are kept to an absolute minimum. I would expect that to continue in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause 277, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to a remarkable moment, which I think that members of the Committee will approach with mixed emotions: relief at the ending of what by any measure has been a mammoth event but sadness at the prospect of no longer being able to listen to the pithy comments that have enlivened our proceedings on so many occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent more than 100 hours considering the Bill, and 1392 amendments have been tabled to it, of which about 100 were proposed by the Government. It does not, therefore require a great mathematician to work the proportion tabled by the Opposition. I have not researched which of the Opposition parties had the lion's share; I suspect that there may be bets on that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has had the opportunity to scrutinise every aspect of the Bill. Our procedure and timetable ensured that in respect of no part of the Bill was the Committee denied the opportunity for debate or to move and discuss amendments. It has been an interesting and useful experience in orderly procedure and has ensured thorough debate of a long and complex Bill without parts being squeezed out, as so often happened in the House of Commons in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has benefited significantly from the Committee's work and our broad approach. We have created a new authority and a new mayor for London. They did not exist 100 years ago, although they may have existed 500 years ago; they will, however, exist next year. That has been confirmed through the Committee's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority's main structure and functions have been confirmed, but we have debated and considered several constructive amendments that sought to amplify some of the procedures and improve some of the arrangements. Apart from the amendments that have been made, we have agreed to take away several others for further consideration. We will return to the House later with our considered responses to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can now look forward to the Bill's further passage. The reprinted Bill will be even longer and will be in excess of 300 clauses and 27 schedules. It will undoubtedly take the House a significant amount of time to consider all that has been done in this Committee on Report, and I am sure that members of the Committee will contribute fully on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1635</span>
I look forward also to the other place considering the Bill. I am certain that, in doing so, it will be mindful and appreciative of the Committee's careful and thorough scrutiny. It will also appreciate the extent to which the Bill honours a manifesto commitment and the fact that it was endorsed by the people of London in the referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to all members of the Committee for their perseverance and attentiveness throughout our proceedings. It would be invidious to single out too many members of the Committee individually, but it would be wrong if I did not mention just one or two who have enlivened our proceedings. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who has led throughout for the Opposition, for his thorough and persistent questioning and his judicious approach. He has not pressed amendments that he felt were unnecessary, but has sought to find out the facts where there has been ambiguity and to gain a greater understanding of what the Bill will achieve. He has pressed issues that he strongly believed needed to be pressed. He has fulfilled his role admirably, and the Committee owes him a considerable debt. I am grateful to the other members of the Conservative Opposition, who have enlivened our proceedings in a variety of ways. Sadly, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is not with us—[HON. MEMBERS: "He is here."] I am delighted that he is present because he worried me during our previous sitting when he did not vote with the official Opposition on some issues and his face indicated a measure of agreement with our opposition to long lists and bureaucratic procedures. I began to wonder where his loyalties would be if the Committee continued much longer. Perhaps it is as well that it is coming to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong not to mention the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, who has, in his inimitable style, given us a great deal to think about and left us all wiser than we were when the Committee began its proceedings. We are all wiser and better informed about obscure matters of Greek poetry, the lesser known poems of Sir Alfred Austin, and the activities of an enormous range of people—not least members of the right hon. Gentleman's family. That was all relayed with the engaging and humorous style that we have all appreciated enormously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had persistent contributions from all three Liberal Democrat Members; indeed, there have been moments when I have wondered whether one of the principles of Liberal Democrat life is never to say something once if it can be said three times. I thank the hon. Gentlemen for their support for many of the principles behind the Bill, even though they still have some way to go in being educated as to the merits of the mayoral system of government. Indeed, their opposition to it left me wondering at times whether their party should not be called Conservative. That issue will no doubt be debated on future occasions. However, the Liberal Democrats have brought acute observation to many aspects of the Bill, and have spoken about matters of great importance in a way that has helped us to improve it. I am grateful to all of them, and even forgive the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1636</span>
for a remark that he made early in the Committee's proceedings, when he described areas further to the south-east than his own constituency as being halfway to Dover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friends for all that they have done in support of the Bill throughout its passage in Committee. I single out for thanks the Minister for Transport in London, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate, who has borne a huge volume of pressure and work and who has given unstinting support throughout the passage of the Bill. I am grateful to her and to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), who has also given sterling support. She attended sittings regularly despite the fact that Home Office matters were on the agenda for only part of our proceedings, for which I am grateful. I am grateful also to the Government Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd), the Lord Commissioner to the Treasury, who has ensured that the Committee is coming happily towards the end of its consideration after more than 100 hours of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends on the Back Benches have enlivened our proceedings with many contributions. Every one of them has contributed at some stage, and they have given us the insight provided by their understanding of issues affecting their constituencies. Some have simply given us insights into the sum of human wit and happiness. I am grateful to all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give our real thanks to the Clerk for all the guidance that he has given us throughout our proceedings. Consideration of the Bill has not been easy, and has involved many complex issues. We have touched on the edge of hybridity at various moments, and he has guided us with extreme skill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also hugely grateful to the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers for their work throughout our proceedings, which have been recorded with the immense accuracy that is always characteristic of their work. We are very grateful indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee would not have been the same, Mr. Winterton, without your deft hand guiding it. It has been an enormous pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. It is not the first time that I have had that pleasure, and I hope that it will not be the last. You have given to our proceedings a style and panache that all hon. Members have valued. You have been tactful in allowing us to stray occasionally from the paths of righteousness, but have never allowed us to go too far. You have brought us back into order whenever the need arose with judgment and good humour. You have ensured that we conducted our proceedings in a good-natured way—I believe that this has been a very good-natured Committee. Despite differences and disagreements, there is something enormously important about a system of government that can allow civilised debate and understanding between people who are all here to ensure that we do the best for our city and for our country. I believe that that owes a great deal to your contribution, Mr. Winterton, as Chairman. I thank you for all that you have done, and I ask that the Bill be reported to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1637</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the Minister's kind remarks addressed to all concerned in the Committee's proceedings. I agree with him about the passage of the Bill with one exception, which I feel obliged to point out. Opposition Members registered protest about the fact that four clauses about the transfer of London Regional Transport to the authority and its integration with public-private partnership were not debated at all in Committee. It will be very much a part of the mayor's role to solve London's transport problems, and not to have debated in Committee the relationship of London Underground to the authority is a weakness and a matter of regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his kind remarks about my role. The Opposition have endeavoured to push the Government to justify their actions and decisions, and we believe that the Bill will leave the Committee in a better form than that in which it entered it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I personally thank you, Mr. Winterton, for the way in which you have handled and conducted the Committee. It is a difficult balance to achieve, but you have managed to be firm without being authoritarian. You have managed to be good humoured and to retain balance in Committee. That has made the Committee much more enjoyable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also convey my thanks to the Clerk, David Lloyd, who has unfailingly provided helpful and constructive advice—telling us what we can and cannot do. That, too, has been much appreciated. I am grateful on my party's behalf to the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters, whose good, reliable service has always enabled us the next day to have a hard look at exactly what was said to call the Government to account for their remarks. That reliable service has been much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate Government Committee members on their discipline; I believe that the Whip had something to do with that. I am not sure whether during the 18 years when we sat over there we were quite so disciplined as they have been; they are entitled to be at ease in their own skins in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the luxury of three Ministers in Committee. I am not sure that a Conservative Government would have left all three here all the time. Nevertheless, it has been an advantage always to have a number of Ministers on hand to respond to our questions. We appreciate the way in which they have handled our inquiries—they have sometimes been a bit more fiery than at other times, but by and large the Committee has been conducted in good humour, and Ministers must take much of the credit for that. I am especially grateful to the minister for London and Construction for the balanced way in which he has responded to all our inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all had a bit of fun on the Opposition Benches. The Liberal Democrats have joined us in opposing a number of matters; we have differed on others. We have a maxim in my family: "Why use a rapier when a bludgeon will do?" I cannot think of any better justification of the strength of that maxim than to look at the Liberal Democrat party. They go about things
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1638</span>
in their own way, and I say best of luck to them. However, I feel that 80 years out of office is beginning to leave its mark. Nevertheless, this has been a good natured, constructive Committee; you have played a large part in that, Mr. Winterton, for which we thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start where the hon. Member for Croydon, left off, by thanking you, Mr. Winterton, for your authoritative and characteristically personable chairmanship. You have brought with you your experience of this place, and we have thoroughly enjoyed your chairmanship. Please pass on our thanks to your colleagues, who have filled the gap when you have not been here. I also warmly associate myself with the thanks that have been given to the Clerk, David Lloyd, and to the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers, all of whom have served us beyond the call of duty, as Clerks and 	<i>Hansard</i> writers always do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the Minister for London and Construction and the hon. member for Croydon, South, I say thank you on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. We have had a positive and constructive relationship throughout, as we had before the Committee, and will, I am sure, continue to have on Report. Our party, like that of the Minister, wants Greater London government to be back in democratic hands. We have been clear about that; we have had differences about the detail, but not about the substance. We have therefore strongly supported the idea of legislating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to make the point that we have also—despite one or two rough moments—had a happy and co-operative relationship with the Labour and Conservative Whips. We certainly think that a timetable procedure almost without exception works well and is a far better procedure than the hit and miss system of the past. One or two matters have fallen outwith the proposed timetable, but by and large we have been able to debate the matters that we wanted to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are in Oscar-giving mode, may I say to the other Ministers that they have clearly been eminent supporting actresses. This is not meant to be a reflection on age, but the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department would clearly get the new actress award, new to the Front Bench as she is. It is good to welcome her. The Minister for Transport in London has been longer in ministerial office. We thank them both for the work that they have done to respond to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our award for the best performance goes, as so often in this place, to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. Not only did he manage to keep up the best actor position under normal circumstances, but he also did so when he lost his papers and once when he lost the reason for his amendment. That shows that experience counts for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For best production team, I nominate my hon. Friends the Members for Sutton and Cheam, for Kingston and Surbiton and for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake), who all supported me. I was the only member of this Committee who also served on the Committee stage of the Bill that abolished the GLC. At that time, my nearest supporting cast member was my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock). However, the Liberal Democrats are getting nearer all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1639</span>
I should like to add to our support team. They are not members of the Committee, and they are not civil servants—therefore, they toil, in many ways, for less reward. It may not be usual, but I am going to name them—Andrew Morgan, Hannah Gardiner, Stephen Knight and Simon Hunt, in particular, have made sure that we have been looked after very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been disagreements, and the hon. Member for Croydon, South has referred to some of them. We have disagreed that this has gone from regional to local government. We have disagreed on the restrictions to the power of the authority and, in particular, of the assembly. We do not like the fact that that power is capped, and we have severe reservations about the Government's proposals for London Transport. But the consolation is that the Bill sets up government for London, rather than abolishing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is much longer than that which led to abolition of the GLC. That contained 106 clauses and 17 schedules. This Bill is many times longer, but the product will none the less be worth while. We join other members of the Committee in saying that even though the result may be imperfect, it will be far better than the current arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unusually, Mr. Winterton, I shall take a couple of moments to thank you on behalf of the usual channels from all parts of the Committee for your co-operation, and the role that you have played in the effective management of our Committee. To save time, may I also ask you to convey similar thanks to Mr. O'Hara, Mr. Benton and Mr. Stevenson for the occasions when they oversaw our proceedings? Incidentally, I think that they wound up with a disproportionately larger share of the late evenings than you did, Mr. Winterton, which is a testament to your judgment in these matters. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise also because the hon. Member for Croydon, South provoked me when he told his football story about Crystal Palace football club. I have been a supporter of Crystal Palace for getting on for 40 years. In the early 1970s, when I had a season ticket, the team had a centre forward of somewhat agricultural characteristic who none the less was ever present, save for one particularly bad-tempered Saturday in a match against Bolton when he managed to get himself sent off. His name was Gerry Queen and he was a minor Scottish international for a time. The headline on the back page of the 	<i>News of the</i>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we move towards the end of this Standing Committee, I thank the members of the Committee for their generous and very kind remarks about my chairmanship. I shall certainly pass on to my fellow Chairmen, Edward O'Hara, George Stevenson and Joe Benton not only my thanks for their contributions but the Committee's thanks for the role that they have played in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate all members of the Committee for taking through, in more than 100 hours of debate, a very complicated and long Bill. All the contributions that have been made from both sides of the Committee have been very worthwhile. I congratulate Members on both the Government and the official Opposition Front Benches, and Members from the minority Opposition party, on the role that they have played. Perhaps I may be allowed to pick out the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for the immense amount of history that he has brought to our debates. That has informed us greatly about government and about London, which is what the Committee has been all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
