<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Greater London Authority Bill</h1></div>
<p>(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</p>
<p><i>[Continuation from column 742]</i></p>
<p>8.30 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been caught unawares, Mr. O'Hara, and have not quite marshalled my thoughts other than to say that clause 163 is a failure in terms of developing power to the people of London and their elected representatives. It starts from a situation in which the Secretary of State has the last word and goes round the houses and back out the other side to that, once again, the Secretary of State has the last word. That is why we intended to divide the Committee on the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dealt comprehensively with the point that the hon. Member for Croydon, South has just made when he first made it. I can understand that he did not like hearing what I said, and particularly disliked that it was factual to the point of being barbed.<br><br>
I shall address my main remarks to the contribution of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He asked five questions about clause 163, some of which related specifically to the powers of the mayor. First, he asked whether the mayor's powers would be sufficient to buy in additional services; the power to modify services would be included in that. Secondly, he asked if the mayor could buy in completely new services as well as additional existing services. Thirdly, he asked whether the mayor will be able to buy in extra frequencies. The answer to all three questions is yes. As we made clear in the White Paper, the mayor will have to pay for those services, and the franchising director will retain the final say in advising the mayor on how his or her requirements can best be met. That will be done in the context of the three criteria that are set out in clause 163(5).<br><br>
Fourthly, the hon. Gentleman asked about the consultation between the franchising director and the mayor on timetables. We intend to table an amendment at a later stage that will place a duty on the franchising director to consult the mayor about the level of provision of services within London. Such consultation may, of course, include timetabling issues. In addition, the GLA and Transport for London will be consulted on timetable changes by the train operating companies under the terms of their franchise agreements.<br><br>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the mayor would be able to introduce a package of additional services in London without intervention by the Secretary of State—for example, on the Chelsea-Hackney line. I can confirm that the mayor will be able to do so, subject
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
to the franchising director, in line with subsection (5), and the financial constraints to which I have already referred. I trust that I have satisfactorily answered the hon. Gentleman's Questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The pause for reflection, or the cause for reflection, was clearly helpful. If the Minister is always to be as helpful after dinner as she has been today, we must arrange our timetables accordingly. Liberal Democrat Members had intended, for the first time in the Committee's proceedings, to abstain. Now that we have heard the Minister's reply, however, we shall vote that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not having risen before my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. I was in 1 Parliament street when a great procession of police trucks drove across Westminster bridge at a major pace. That caused me to be one minute and 30 seconds late in getting back into the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pound</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was noted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My remarks are addressed to my Whip.<br><br>
When the Committee discussed clause 136, I looked forward to clause 163. The Minister was kind enough to recognise that I had done so, but at the time I said that I thought that the clauses had a degree of inconsistency with one another, because the franchising director was to have the ultimate power under clause 163. I did not pick the Minister up on her remark, and I do not mind it in the least, given the current hour.<br><br>
The clause has brought us to the reality of the mayor's powers vis-à-vis the franchising director. There is no point either in blinking or pretending that the provisions are not as they are. There is a genuine problem, because of the limits on the mayor's powers.<br><br>
I shall make one final plea. Before the sitting was suspended for dinner, the Minister referred to the Government's inheritance from the previous Administration, as she does very occasionally. I allow her one or two such remarks a day, because they are a form of therapy, and we need to keep her going if we are to get through the Bill. I have referred to my father's association with the Southern Railway. I reflect with interest on what British Rail did to the Southern Railway after 1948, when the railway was remarkable and was making all the profits of the private companies before nationalisation, which were subsequently transferred into looking after other railways. Much of the inheritance of which the Minister spoke derives from strategic and policy decisions taken after 1948, which drained what became the Southern region funds and put them elsewhere. The cattle truck mentality goes back to that era.<br><br>
I remember when I was growing up sitting in a deck chair watching the Southern Railway Cricket team play at Raynes Park, with Mr. Rogers the traffic superintendent sitting in a deck chair next to me with his back to the embankment. He never looked at his watch, a piece of paper or anything except the cricket. If a train rumbled past on the embankment behind him, however, he would say either "One minute late" or "Two minutes early", quite clearly having a metronome in his head.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke about the line between Waterloo and Basingstoke. He referred to the example of Surbiton. Trains on the Waterloo to Basingstoke line have no difficulty in stopping at Wimbledon during the tennis fortnight. All of the problems referred to by the Minister related to why it is impossible to inject extra resources. If enough money is available from the passengers to whom it is convenient to get on and off at Wimbledon, however, the system is capable of being adjusted. That is why the Bill runs the risk of raising Londoners' expectations. They might believe that with the mayor all the problems will be resolved. Hon. Members who are Londoners know that the train system operates much further out than the scope of our own considerations. We need to convince our constituents and Londoners that under the relative powers of the mayor and the franchising director, the benefits that they will receive from the Bill and the new arrangements will be relatively modest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I have been at some pains to point out the difficulties inherent in transforming surface rail services within and without London at the behest of the mayor, for reasons that I have defined more than once. I have made it abundantly clear where I believe the blame lies. I was interested in that brief history of the Southern Railway. I remember travelling on another line at a time not far distant from the era to which the right hon. Gentleman referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is not that old.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would be surprised.<br><br>
I distinctly remember the poor service that was being provided even then. That reminds me of the point that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made about setting standards far too low for the services that we expected after benighted privatisation. I trust that I am accurate in this, but one of the reasons why there was so little money to spare for investment immediately after the nationalisation of our railways was that sizeable amounts had to be paid year on year to the previous owners of those railways. That said, I hope that the clause will stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

Clause 164</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
AUTHORITY AND TRANSPORT FOR LONDON NOT TO BE RAILWAY FRANCHISEES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 880, in page 83, leave out line 28.<br><br>
This is a simple amendment, which would take out of clause 164(2) the second category of authority—Transport for London. Clause 164 is one of those funny clauses that amends an Act in which there is another list. This is a probing amendment. It is more a question of the Hackney-Chelsea line or the north Woolwich line than of the Raynes Park express.<br><br>
We want to explore whether inserting the reference to Transport for London in the Railways Act 1993 would preclude the railways in London from having TfL as their contracted operator after the creation of the Greater London Authority. I shall give one example, and I should be interested to know how it would work.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake), who looks after transport issues generally for my colleagues and I in London, has identified railways lines on which the tube could be run. An interesting prospect has just resurfaced in the press, and I hope that we would all sign up to it in principle and take it forward. It relates to the creation of something that this week's Sunday papers called the "Rail M25 for London". We could create an orbital railway by adding one mile in east London to the existing lines round London. The price would, on all estimates, be considerably lower than that for one mile of the wonderful Jubilee line extension, which is currently being dug through the constituency of the Minister for London and Construction and through mine, which contains the largest section. The estimate for the additional mile was £350 million.<br><br>
It would be a good idea to have flexibility. It would be a good idea for the railway operators, the strategic rail authority and the franchising director to be able to commission from Transport for London that, if necessary and appropriate, the underground could run on those tracks.<br><br>
8.45 pm<br><br>
This is not an identical parallel, but I expect that you are aware, Mr. O'Hara, that in Brussels, the tram above surface becomes the metro underground. It is the same in many other cities. In Manchester, the new metro railway line acts effectively as a light railway. It is not the conventional old railway; it is run, in part, through the same stations and on the same track, although sometimes on the old tram track and sometimes on new lines. Such flexibility seems entirely desirable. Other bodies are also keen to see such flexibility.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wellington has committed us to supporting the idea of an orbital railway. We had a regional party conference the other week, to which he put a paper and about which, I am sure, all hon. Members read voluminous reports. My hon. Friend committed us to that project in a paper called "Capital Gains: new transport for London". It is a cost-efficient and logistically sensible way of using the different networks together.<br><br>
Can the Minister give us some encouragement? We would need to delete this reference to Transport for London if we were to allow the tube, for example, to be a franchisee in the new Greater London authority in the wonderful century to come. I hope that that is possible, and that the amendment, at least in principle, can be accepted. We are quite happy to sit in a dark room doing the drafting later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try and respond positively, briefly and concisely to the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. We do not envisage Transport for London being a franchisee. That would be inconsistent with the general structure that we propose for Transport for London, and that is why we will not accept the amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made the perfectly sensible proposition that the underground and rail surface trains could run a joint operation, over a common area of track. We envisage a framework under which such an arrangement could be entered into, although Transport for London would not be the franchisee. We certainly want a flexible framework, and we want to encourage close co-operation between the underground network and those responsible for surface trains. However, we do not wish to accept the amendment, which would create an anomaly. Transport for London would change from a body that predominantly procures surface rail services into one where the relationships were confused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued. I understand the argument. Does that mean that the Minister would contemplate allowing London Underground to be in a franchise in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the whole arrangement relating to London Underground will be the subject of the public-private partnership. We will undoubtedly be debating that further later this evening. It would be wrong to anticipate that debate, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not envisage a situation in which TfL would be precluded from arranging a sensible operation to make joint use of track, along the lines that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. However, we do not envisage TfL being a franchisee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This becomes mysteriouser and mysteriouser. I do not want to spoil everybody's fun for the debate on PPP. The Minister appears to be suggesting that the principle is accepted that the tube might run on lines otherwise used for the railway service. I was in Rickmansworth the other day, where tube and surface trains run along the same track.<br><br>
I am not trying to trap the Minister into making a definition that would embarrass him. Is he saying that in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
London it would be possible for the underground, or whatever it was called, to be the agent for travel—however that was defined, and whether it was a franchisee or not—on lines that might otherwise be operated, or under the direction of, the strategic rail authority? I am trying to ensure that we are agreed on the objective that the SRA will, if appropriate, be able to use the tube as part of its strategic planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To help the hon. Gentleman, the current arrangement between Harrow and Amersham involves Chiltern Railways as the franchisee with London Underground having use of the track; London Underground will be changed by the public-private partnership, but we envisage a similar flexibility to ensure a sensible joint operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that assurance. The Croxley link is a case in point, whereby London Underground could operate metropolitan services straight through to Watford Junction, along the Railtrack line. Can the Minister assure us that funding would be forthcoming for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but I cannot anticipate the mayor's decisions on funding. I can say that we want to put in place a sensible arrangement that will allow joint working, where appropriate, to optimise the use of Railtrack and underground networks in London. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and that he will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats are reassured—although we do not know what will happen. A common view of the matter exists and there are many opportunities to be taken. The east London line extension northwards to link with the Hackney-Chelsea line and southwards to Lewisham and Croydon are good examples of cheap, value-for-money options.<br><br>
On the basis that we are at one on the objectives, even though the Government have not worked out the structure of the proposals—we will come up with lots of good schemes for the Government's consideration—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful for a sentence or two to explain what transitional arrangements the Government envisage. The franchise arrangements will continue before the creation of the GLA and of Transport for London, and the clause appears to suggest that they should continue until the end of their contract period, which seems logical. Could the Minister confirm that that implies that the power to renew the contract will come into force the end of the

existing arrangements, but that the power to vary does not have to wait until then? That power, which was referred to earlier, could begin on day one if that were the intention of the GLA.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that we are about to consider new clauses that deal with PPP requirements, I trust that it would be in order for me to say a few words on the matter. I hope that the explanatory notes on PPP amendments have helped the Committee.<br><br>
Notwithstanding the exchanges between the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and myself this morning, good progress has been made since my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister referred to PPP on Second Reading on 14 December. As the Committee knows, the Government have tabled a number of amendments to PPP, which we shall debate this evening.<br><br>
The new clauses have two main purposes. First, and most importantly, they will ensure that passenger services continue, whatever may happen to an individual PPP contractor. We do not expect a PPP contractor to become insolvent or deliberately to take steps that would make it difficult for the public sector to regain full
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
control of vital pieces of equipment. However, we must be prudent and ensure that the strongest possible legal safeguards are in place to deal with the consequences of such events, and to prevent them from happening in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if the Minister sketched in the background to how a PPP contractor will be set up and the context in which it will operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be helpful if the Committee were examining the detail of individual contracts, but we are not. The purpose of the new clauses is to establish a legal framework to ensure that, once the PPP contracts are in place, public services will not be reduced through, for example, insolvency on the part of a PPP contractor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to be difficult, nor am I probing into the nature of a PPP contract. I know what a privatisation is; I know what a nationalisation is; and I think I know what a PPP is. However, will the Minister tell us what a PPP is, so that we can put the new clauses into context?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat for the hon. Gentleman's benefit what has been said several times in the public domain. What we know as London Underground—or London Underground Ltd.—will be divided into three infrastructure companies. The operating company, which will transfer to TFL, will be responsible for passengers as we will regard them—the day-to-day running and provision of services. The three companies will be presented to the market. Potential PPP contractors will be able to bid competitively for those infrastructure companies. We will not examine the details of the contractual arrangements in Committee.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
It is proposed that the contracts will run for 30 years and that there will be tight specifications about outcomes and performance levels. When we reach the amendments relating to PPPs, which we shall do shortly, we shall discuss the absolute guarantee that, at the end of the contract, all assets will immediately be returned to the public sector. As we have said previously, there is no possibility of key assets being sold or of the introduction of a process of privatisation.<br><br>
In essence, that is the shape of our proposal. We shall discuss it when we set out the legal framework and the changes that are needed to introduce PPP contracts. I trust that that answers the hon. Gentleman's questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the operating company be a subsidiary of TFL, and will the three infrastructure contracts be with TFL?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The operating company will be part of TFL—it will be part of the integrated transport infrastructure, in which the mayor will have an interest. A separate Corporate body will not be involved. I do apologise—I have forgotten the hon. Gentleman's question about infrastructure companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will infrastructure contracts be with TFL?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. As we have already said, our proposal, with regard to the definition of best value, is that the Government, who began the PPP process, will conclude that process. We shall later discuss the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
possibility of assessing the delivery of outcomes during the 30-year contract. We assume that the contracts will, in effect, be signed by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's explanation of the background is helpful, but it would have been better if a Special Standing Committee had been convened. We could have questioned experts on PPPs before enacting the Bill.<br><br>
Will the operating leases for the three infrastructure subdivisions be the same? Do the differences in the relevant line networks mean that there will be variations in the contract? Will the Minister explain before Parliament any deals that she makes, or does the Government's proposal involve a cosy little arrangement that will not have to be reported to the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am not clear what the hon. Gentleman means by variations in the contract. We have made it abundantly clear that the infrastructure—tunnels, tracks and signalling, for example—will involve three infrastructure companies, which will cover the whole infrastructure of the underground network. Three contracts will be presented: one for each infrastructure company, and it will be for the market—those who wish to be PPP contractors—to bid competitively for the companies. I am happy to say that much interest has been expressed, of necessity, the contracts will not vary in quality or with regard to the desired outcomes relating to improvement, maintenance, modernisation. We will see the improvements on the underground that should be introduced. It is highly unlikely that there will be any variation in the length of time for which a contract will run, because a sizeable amount of work will be involved. In that context, there will be no variation at all, although there may be variations within the infrastructure companies of the work that needs to be done which will be defined by London Underground Ltd. There will be variations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that there is no reason why one company should not take out three operating leases? The lines are very different. For example, deep lines differ in character from surface lines and the requirements for infrastructure improvements vary enormously. Could not one company enter into three separate deals according to the characteristics of the tracks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be entirely up to the bids that we receive. It is highly unlikely that one company exclusively will be able to propose a bid that contains the guarantees and improvements which are necessary before a contract is agreed. We are committed to ensuring not only the best possible outcomes but the best value for the public. It is my understanding that competitively it is better to have more than one person competing for contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I continue with the point that I was making. The Minister confirmed that the contracts will be between the Government and the contractor. Will the contracts at any stage be transferred to Transport for London?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not wish to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but, as I said, the Government are committed to seeing through the process. However, the contracts will transfer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Straight away?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see no virtue in delay, so I imagine that it will happen straight away.<br><br>
The second main aim of our new clause is to ensure that the process of implementing the public-private partnership will take place as efficiently as possible and that unnecessary costs are avoided. As I said to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, PPP contractors will be required to meet demanding performance specifications which will be set by London Underground and written into their contracts. Those requirements will be comprehensive. There will be special arrangements for major projects such as line upgrade, resignalling schemes and major station developments. As far as possible, performance requirements will be specified in terms of output. Payments to the contractors will be linked directly to performance. For example, they will lose money for every minute of delay attributable to infrastructure problems. The amount will be based on the impact of the delay. Detailed work is taking place to develop performance specifications for each line and station.<br><br>
It is the working assumption of London Underground and the Government that PPP contracts will last for 30 years. The need for flexibility over that period will be included in PPP arrangements. The mayor, through TFL and London Underground, will be able to use the variation clauses in the PPP contract to make additional improvements to the tube infrastructure beyond those specified. The mayor will also have some scope for setting priorities within what will be contractually specified.<br><br>
The mayor and the PPP contractors will need to review future requirements from time to time. The PPP contracts will therefore set out procedures for periodic reviews which will be held every seven and a half years. The seven-and-a-half-year review cycle clearly means that not every mayor will have an opportunity to take a more wide-ranging look at future needs over and above the flexibility built into the contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What will happen if it is not possible to reach agreement during a seven-and-a-half-year review? Will the contract end?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall touch on that later. An arbitrator will deal with disagreements between the PPP contractor and the mayor. We should like the periodic reviews to be carried out in a spirit of partnership. The arbiter will be appointed by the Secretary of State on the request of either the mayor or a PPP contractor. The arbiter will be given statutory powers and duties, and we shall introduce amendments on Report setting out what those powers will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh no.<br><br>
On point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The situation is that not even the clauses that we are discussing are in their final form. The Government now say that they will table more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
amendments on Report. What is the point of the Committee sitting tonight and debating clauses that will not be used?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is a complaint, but it is not a point of order for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that this strikes me as crying wolf once too often. We are considering a vast range of detailed new clauses. I have given the Committee an assurance that, on Report, we shall introduce an amendment relating to one particular issue. I am sure that no one is under any illusions about the length or complexity of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had no illusions at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the illusions from which the hon. Gentleman and his party suffer received their come-uppance in May 1997.<br><br>
However, as I was saying, we intend to give the arbiter statutory powers, and we shall table amendments on Report setting out what they will be. We envisage the arbiter having three main duties. First, to secure the provision, maintenance, renewal and improvement of the underground infrastructures. Secondly, to promote efficiency in provision, maintenance, renewal and improvement of the underground infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are these the amendments the Government will introduce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to take literary criticism from a sedentary position, but if the hon. Gentleman really wishes to assist both the Committee and, indeed, the future improvement of transport in London, I am happy to listen to his ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best thing the Minister could do to help transport in London would be to work out what she wants and, when she is ready, introduce it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I hope that will be included in the record because we have just heard from the hon. Member for Croydon, South that he and his party are prepared to allow the situation regarding London Transport to deteriorate year after year. The Government have introduced a long and complex Bill. However, we are not prepared to allow London to endure, for another decade, the lack of attention, stewardship and investment that Londoners are currently having to live with, and which are the legacies of the previous Administration.<br><br>
To continue with what I was saying, the third of the arbiter's main duties will be to enable an efficient PPP contractor to finance its activities at the rate of return that it bid in the initial competition, and to carry out its obligations with reasonable certainty.<br><br>
The arbiter will, therefore, have a role that lies somewhere between the arbitrator of a contractual dispute and a utility style regulator. That recognises the unique nature of the public private partnership. Very importantly, though, the arbiter will not set investment priorities for the underground. That will be a matter for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
the mayor and for Transport for London. The arbiter's role will essentially be to set a fair price for the improvements that the mayor and Transport for London wish to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Londoners were led to believe that they should turn to the mayor if the improvement of services was not forthcoming, because the mayor would be accountable. Now we are told that the arbiter, who is accountable to no one, will set fares. Operators will complain that they are too low; passengers will complain that they are too high, and it will be a muddle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far from being a muddle, this provision guarantees that the services that London wants will be delivered by the mayor and Transport for London. The arbiter will have a statutory responsibility to arbitrate in the event of a disagreement between the mayor and a PPP contractor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the punchline will be that the arbiter will be the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pound</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not a bad idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, its a very bad idea.<br><br>
Before the Minister's trailer for clauses that we are yet to see ends, will she tell the Committee why the period of 30 years was chosen? Moreover, are we again creeping towards an over-300-clause Bill, which the Government were trying hard to prevent some weeks ago?</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is asking a serious question. I have already said that the Secretary of State will appoint the arbiter: certainly, the arbiter will not be the Secretary of State. As for the length of the contract, it is based on London Underground's assessment of the period for which it will possible to run services and carry out long-term development and improvement of the underground, and on the need to guarantee long-term stability of funding for the underground system.<br><br>
I said that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister had stated on Second Reading that London Underground would proceed to restructure its business in the first half of this year. London Underground Ltd. will therefore become primarily an operating company, although it will have important safety responsibilities, and will remain wholly in the public sector. I have already touched on the pre-infrastructure companies.<br><br>
As for safety, it is of primary importance that the good safety record is maintained and improved through the public-private partnership. Safety of passengers and staff is a top priority, and the PPP will go ahead only when the safety of the new structure is absolutely assured. I assure the Committee that Her Majesty's railway inspectorate is fully involved in monitoring the development of the PPP. Any changes that could affect the safety of the network will have to be approved by the inspectorate, which is a vital safeguard that should reassure all tube users.<br><br>
The Committee is understandably concerned about whether Transport for London can afford the PPP, about which I shall make four points. First, the modelling
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 755</span>
suggests that TFL will be able to fund PPP. That is not to say that TFL will not need grant for its other transport activities, but the modelling suggests that grant should not be necessary to fund the underground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We told you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have always made that abundantly clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh no you have not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes we have. Secondly, the modelling that I mentioned is not based on reasonable assumptions or conservative goals. It assumes a real increase in fares after 2001, and a 1 per cent, real increase in fares next year and in 2001. It is also based on fulfilling London Underground's aspirations for high quality and much improved tube system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say it was based on a decrease in fares?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I said it was based on a 1 per cent, increase next year and in 2001.<br><br>
Thirdly, our aim is to avoid paying further grant if possible, but that is not a prerequisite of concluding the public-private partnership. If it represents good value for money, central Government grant to TFL will be based on the assumption that part of the total will be needed to meet London Underground's payments to the PPP contractor.<br><br>
Finally, I should add that we will not do a deal for a PPP at any cost. The scheme is not based on an ideological belief in the superiority of the private sector. We would not waste money on holding a competition if we did not expect to receive bids representing better value for money than the alternatives. I know that Committee members would like to see the financial modelling that I have mentioned, in order to judge for themselves whether the PPP is likely to be affordable. We have thought carefully about releasing the information, especially following a request from the Transport Select Committee in its report on the PPP last year. To be of any use we would need to release a large amount of material, much of which would be helpful to bidders. That would prejudice London Underground's negotiating position in the PPP competition, so we shall not release that modelling.<br><br>
London Underground is continuing to develop the PPP structure and the contract and performance specifications for its implementation. Such matters cannot and should not be rushed. As my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced on Second Reading, the Government will not be pushed into announcing a detailed timetable for the PPP publication. That would immediately put the public sector at a big disadvantage in negotiation with bidders. Contrary to the comments of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood from a sedentary position, there is, as there has always been, a great deal of interest in the public-private partnership proposal, and I repeat that for his benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the justified criticism about the price at which some of the railways were sold off under the previous Administration, will the Minister say what procedures the Government are committed to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 756</span>
for ensuring that any disposal to the private sector is independently valued as good value for money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I look at previous examples, it would be entirely possible to furnish a Select Committee with the relevant documents. We are at the stage of competitive bidding, as the hon. Gentleman is aware, and I have already touched on why it would not be appropriate to release the modelling at this stage, but it would be entirely possible for it to be examined by a Select Committee on the understanding that such examination would be privileged.<br><br>
We have made it abundantly clear that after the creation of the GLA and the Assembly, although advice to Ministers is usually privileged and remains so, all the background papers will be available for scrutiny. There may need to be requirements on the grounds of commercial confidentiality with regard to the Assembly, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are considering the creation of a deal concerning the public-private partnership of which the Government can be proud and which will also produce benefits in a vastly improved transport system in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady confirm that the eventual cost to the operating companies of acquiring leases could be made known to an inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee, so that the matter would be open to parliamentary scrutiny and so that Londoners would know that public assets would not be flogged off at a ludicrously low price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the scandalous examples of the previous Administration in doing precisely that—selling off national assets at a fraction of their real worth—it is certainly this Government's intention that the public-private partnership will be something of which we can be justifiably proud. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that his concerns are unfounded and misplaced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Public Accounts Committee can inquire into the PPP costs and obtain the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a procedure to go through and if the Minister has finished, we can proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr O'Hara. I spoke at such great length that I had forgotten the reason for rising to my feet. It was to present new clauses 36, 37 and 38, which are largely technical amendments.<br><br>
New clause 36 introduces a new definition of the word "disposal" into section 9 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984. London Underground will be using their powers under section 9 of the 1984 Act as the means of transferring to the private sector PPP contractors the assets and contracts which the contractors will need to start fulfilling their contractual obligations from the beginning of their contracts. Section 9 does not define the term "disposal", and it might therefore be interpreted as a once-and-for-all sale with no intention to re-acquire the business or its assets. However, as I have said, PPP contracts will be for 30 years only, after which the public sector will resume full responsibility for the network's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 757</span>
infrastructure, and/or the assets needed to run services will transfer back to London Underground. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The original transaction passing assets—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background noise is getting too much. If hon. Members are bursting to say something, I am happy to give the maximum opportunity to contribute to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
The PPP company will therefore certainly not be a once-and-for-all disposal. New clause 36 defines a disposal widely enough to enable assets to be transferred under section 9 in the knowledge that, unless they have been replaced by newer, better assets in the meantime, PPP assets will return to London Underground at the end of the contract.<br><br>
New clause 37 is a technical amendment arising from the creation of Transport for London and our proposals for a public-private partnership for London Underground. London Transport and its subsidiaries are currently exempted from the access, franchising, closure and licensing requirements that apply to railways under the Railways Act 1993, except where London Underground and a train operating company run their trains over the same tracks.<br><br>
However, the 1994 exemption order needs to be amended, for two main reasons. First, it exempts London Transport by name, so it must be amended if it is to continue when underground services are provided by Transport for London. Secondly, it requires amending if it is clearly to exempt PPP contractors when acting to fulfil their obligations under a PPP contract. The exemption would in future also apply to the docklands light railway, once it becomes a subsidiary of TFL, effectively replacing its existing exemption.<br><br>
New clause 38 is intended to clear up an anomaly which arose from the Railways Act 1993 and which could make it unnecessarily difficult for TFL to promote projects that integrated the uderground with the national rail network. That potential problem does not affect any of the existing services operated by London Underground. The new clause provides that, notwithstanding the mayor's transport duties, TFL and London Transport, TfL and LT may enter into regulated access agreements under the Railways Act 1993.<br><br>
The new clause also adds to the duties of the rail regulator and the Secretary of State under section 4 of the Railways Act a requirement when exercising their powers under part I of that Act to have regard to the ability of the mayor, TfL and LT to carry out their statutory functions. We believe that that is a sensible solution, which is supported by the rail regulator as well as by London Transport.<br><br>
I therefore commend new clauses 36, 37 and 38 to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed to debate the Second reading of the new clauses, I draw hon. Ministers' attention to new clauses relating to chapters VIII to X of part IV, which are at the end of the list of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
amendments. They are printed out of order on the amendment paper. We shall debate new clauses relating to chapters I to VI of part IV and we shall have the opportunity to deal with new clauses relating to chapters VII to X at the appropriate point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the real truth. We now know why the Government were so keen to debate the new clauses this evening. All the newspaper presses have gone to bed: there is no way that the story can make the newspapers for tomorrow morning.<br><br>
We have just heard that the Government's plans for a public-private partnership are in absolute chaos and are a shambles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNulty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understood it only too well.<br><br>
May I first, Mr. O'Hara, welcome your indulgence in allowing the Minister to speak for the majority of the time about amendments that she has yet to table? We have heard of shadow railway authorities; we are now speaking to shadow amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says no. She has been talking about arbitrators at great length and says that these are amendments that she will table on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred to one issue, which was with the arbitrator. The bulk of what I spoke to the Committee on leads directly to the clauses that the Committee is about to debate.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My impression was that the Minister spoke for the last two or three minutes on those points. However, we are grateful for her explanation in response to out questions, it is the first time that we have had a chance to question Ministers in this way on this subject.<br><br>
I want to start with the statement that there will be one operating company, which will be part of TfL. That confirms the press releases that we have had a chance to read—that the operations will remain in the public sector. Why does the Minister think that the public sector is best qualified to run London Underground? We know that the Government do not trust London Transport to manage the Jubilee line project, for example. We know that private management had to be brought in for the docklands light railway. There would be a wry smile on the faces of many people if she could persuade us that the current managers of London Underground are those best equipped to run it for the next 30 years.<br><br>
My second question relates to the nature of the 30-year contracts. The Minister said that they would have flexibility and she spoke of three features—that they would have variation clauses, that the mayor would have the power to vary the clauses within the contractual terms and that there would be reviews after seven and a half years. My understanding of a contract is that it is something that is agreed by two parties. If they are not of the same mind, there is not an agreement. If a party enters into a contract and the mayor then wants to vary the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 759</span>
contract but the contractor does not agree, there is not a meeting of minds. Therefore, there is not a contractual relationship.<br><br>
Likewise, the Minister says that there will be reviews after seven and a half years and that an arbitrator will arbitrate in disputes on the reviews. That presupposes that the arbitrator has the power to make an award against one of the parties. A party cannot withdraw from the contract if he does not accept the arbitrator's decision: the arbitrator retains the parties in a binding agreement. Therefore, it is not a review. There is a disputes clause, as it were.<br><br>
My final point on the contracts is this. How can the Minister or the Government say at the beginning of a 30-year contract what the state of technology will be in, say, 20 years' time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Precisely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From that, I anticipate that the Minister will say in response that that is the purpose of the reviews and variations. But what if the parties cannot agree? In that case it is not a review; the arbitrator will simply impose his powers on one unwilling party. If a property clause has reviews in it, the contract ends unless there is agreement.<br><br>
The final point is that of finance., The Minister made four points. She said that the Government would give a grant to TFL to help it to meet its obligations under the PPP. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I stand to be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we have made abundantly clear is that there may be a need for a grant but, based on the model that has been examined for the PPP contract, we are not looking to provide a grant for that matter. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have been at pains to present, in the light of the Government's clear commitment to see the PPP contract through from beginning to end, LU financing as a black hole because the PPP is not coming on-stream as speedily as they presupposed. We have always made it clear that we would never allow London Underground to drop into a black hole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. What will happen if there is an insufficient revenue stream from either TFL or other sources available to the mayor to meet the TFL's obligations under a PPP?<br><br>
The Minister also made the point that there will be a 1 per cent, real fare increase next year and in 2001. What will be the fare structure thereafter? She knows that there is a figure of retail prices index minus 1 per cent for the railways. Will such a clause be included in a TFL PPP arrangement?<br><br>
The Minister said that she considered letting Committee members look at financial information relating to the PPP, but she concluded that it was confidential and not appropriate for disclosure. Is it possible for us to observe, in a closed room, contractual information which we will not be able to take away and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
therefore not be able to disclose to bidders? I would be happy to sign the Official Secrets Act because it is highly relevant information. If she is to have constructive opposition to a novel form of contract, she needs to be pressed and probed as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that Her Majesty's Government now realise how easy it is to make promises on the hustings and how difficult it is to put them into sensible legislative effect if they have not been thought through. The idea of a PPP to run London Underground is seductive, but those who have experience of lease operations know that it is the most difficult form of contract to negotiate and the most fraught with risk. Those who take PPPs on are likely to demand stringent conditions to ensure that they get a proper return. That will be costly for those who have to use their services.<br><br>
The Minister is clear that the operating leases will be for 30 years, but there is no certainty that the companies will be satisfied with that. In many respects, 30 years is a short period in which to obtain an adequate return for the investment that is required to modernise and improve London's underground infrastructure. It appears on first sight that LRT will have to pay exceedingly high charges to the infrastructure companies. However, the arbiter has to be introduced into the equation, because Londoners will not be prepared to pay exorbitantly high fares, which is the only way that the charges can be passed on to passengers. Operating companies will face a lower return than is normal in commerce. Consequently, they will not be prepared to pay for the leases the sum that the Government have anticipated. I am sure that the Government will therefore need to supply a grant to make up the difference.<br><br>
However, once the principle of supplying grants to make up the difference is conceded, obtaining them will become an annual event. Operating companies will go cap in hand to the mayoralty, to the Government and to all and sundry who can be lobbied. Droves of Londoners, who will suffer bad services and high fares, will insist that the Government cough up the money. However, we have been told that PPPS will obviate the need for Government grants, that there will be no black holes in the future and that London Underground's future is secure.<br><br>
It is extraordinary that the Government, who are more or less two years into their term of office, should bring to the Committee great tracts of new clauses that alter their proposals for the most important of their manifesto pledges for London. They had not worked out their proposals in advance, but the response from the marketplace meant that they had to rethink their approach. Moreover, they are legislating on the hoof. They have told us that even if the new clauses are agreed to, they will ask us to accept yet more amendments on Report. It is very nice having a large majority, but if Labour Members do not use their critical faculties to influence the Government and to ensure that they fulfil their election commitments to Londoners, Londoners will soon desire a different parliamentary balance—and rightly so. In the meantime, they will have the opportunity to cast their votes in the mayoralty and London assembly elections.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 761</span>
I feel sorry for the Minister. Candidly, any Minister who tried to present an effective legislative framework in these uncertain circumstances would be out of his or her depth. The circumstances are uncertain because the Government opted for a third way—an indeterminate fudge—which has neither the merits of outright privatisation nor the clarity and accountability of nationalisation. London's travelling public will get the worst of both worlds. Labour Members appear to be mute on this subject, and I suppose that we will have to accept the new clauses in the knowledge that they will be overtaken by events and replaced by further new clauses on Report. Indeed, the process may begin all over again in the other place—who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not clear from the Minister's remarks whether the Government are totally confused about their PPP plans or whether they are legislating on the hoof. Perhaps Committee members should give them the benefit of the doubt. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] If right hon. and hon. Members are patient, they may be happier with my subsequent remarks.<br><br>
The Minister made one welcome comment: she said that the PPP contracts will be reviewed. When my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) made that suggestion on Second Reading, she dismissed it. She said that the proposal was nonsense and that it would be impossible to make such contractual arrangements and to review them. However, the Government have already gone back on their strong objection to the Liberal Democrat position. We are delighted that they have admitted that technological and other changes mean that the contracts will, by their very nature, have to be reviewed. That is a welcome step, but for each step in the right direction, they have taken 10 steps back.<br><br>
The Minister described the rather complex process whereby the Government first negotiate the contract with private sector contractors. She said that only the Government would carry out those negotiations, but Government new clause 41 allows the mayor to designate PPP contracts and perhaps she will clarify that in due course. She said first that negotiation of contracts would be limited to the Secretary of State and the Government, but then said that the contracts would go to the mayor every seven and half years who would be able to review them and set the investment priorities. Those priorities could be different from those originally agreed and if there was a dispute the arbitrator would come in.<br><br>
9.45 pm<br><br>
That rather complex system of negotiation has been sprung on the Committee tonight with no forewarning. The implication is that it will massively increase the costs of the PPP process. One of the major worries for a private sector company entering negotiations is the risks involved in such contracts—construction risks, such as tunnel collapse and electrical faults within the system, with which the operator of the infrastructure will have to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 762</span>
deal. Those are inherent, but there will also be funding risks. The Government are now adding more risks with the possibility that the contract will have to be renegotiated, with an arbitrator coming in and changing the contract.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the contracts will be completely open ended? If unforeseen problems arise—for example, electrical problems or a sudden deterioration of the cement in the tunnels—the contract will be open ended, the arbitrator will have to find in favour of the contractor and the people of London will have to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Those risks were inherent in the PPP structure before tonight, but the Government have now added another risk, because the arbitrator can change the terms of the contract. What happens when risks are added to risks? The costs ratchet up. Compared with the public sector—the simple nationalised option—the costs will be extreme. The Minister said that the modelling would not be published and I am not surprised. She said that that was due to commercial confidence considerations, but we know that that is not the reality. We know from Peter Ford, the former chairman of London Transport, that the PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis, from which most of the modelling results were taken, put the PPP option at the bottom of the list. On 6 May last year, he was asked by the Labour chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs:
<br><blockquote><p>"Could you tell us what the cost of modernising and maintaining the underground infrastructure by means of these proposals would be in comparison with the cost if London Underground had remained entirely within the public sector."</p></blockquote>
Mr Ford replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"The options that have been picked were towards the bottom end of our list just on a pure financial analysis. The difference between the public sector option that we advocated and the options that have been selected to go forward was of the order of £1 billion over 25 years."</p></blockquote>
We now know, because Peter Ford has told us, that the Government will not let us see the modelling because it would show that their proposals are ludicrous. From what the Minister has said tonight, they are even more ludicrous and expensive. The Minister did not tell us whether she had put the proposals to all the interested parties to whom she keeps referring. During a debate in the Chamber, we heard of a <i>Construction News</i> report recently that the 100 or so intimate parties about which the Government keep telling us are not that interested and do not believe that PPP will work. I wonder whether they know the new conditions and risks that the Government are talking about tonight. Have they been consulted? What is their reaction? Is Railtrack, which has advocated long leases, happy to have its contract reviewed four times during the life of that contract? If the Minister says, yes, that will be very interesting. I hope that she will tell the Committee the reactions of other interested parties.<br><br>
I thought that we would deal with the pros and cons of PPPs at a later point, but the Minister is trying to sell them to us now, so now is the time for that debate. From my point of view, she has made her problems appear even worse. Conservative Members have asked what will happen to the PPP framework if the revenue from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 763</span>
fares falls and congestion charges are not in place? That is a fair question. What will happen if those revenue streams are not there and the money runs out? We do not know. Presumably, either the trains will stop running—which the Government are unlikely to accept—or fares will have to increase massively.<br><br>
The Government made an important announcement this evening that fares will increase by 1 per cent, above the rate of inflation in the next two years. However, that increase may not prove sufficient. Fares may have to rise much higher than that, otherwise the Government might have to inject the public sector subsidy to which the Minister referred, and on which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood picked up.<br><br>
In the comprehensive spending review, the public sector contributions to London Underground for the years 2000–01 and 2000–02 are set at nil. In the light of the Minister's comments this evening, will the comprehensive spending review therefore have to be revised to make the PPP plans work? The matter is fundamental to the Bill that we are being asked to enact.<br><br>
I am a new Member of Parliament, but I am staggered by this evening's proceedings. We are trying to agree a legal framework for contracts to run the whole of London's transport system for the next 30 years, yet information that is crucial to our deliberations has been given to us immediately prior to the debate. That is scandalous. Had you called the Minister to order, Mr. O'Hara, I would not have been surprised. If "Erskine May" does not deal with such points, it should be revised. I am a member of the Procedure Select Committee and perhaps I shall make that recommendation to the chairman, who is one of your colleagues, <i>[interruption.]</i> In criticising "Erskine May" I am not criticising you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
The Minister talked about the centrality of performance indicators to the Government's vision of the way in which the PPP plans will work. They will last for 30 years and will be revised every seven and a half years. It will be interesting to find out how the contracts will set them. Will the performance indicators deal with things that people really care about, such as the smoothness of the ride and level of security at stations? Such things are difficult to define. Perhaps they will be similar to those that LT strives, but tends to fail, to meet year on year. What will happen if the PPP contractors fail to meet those difficult performance indicators? Will penalties be imposed on them? Will their fees be reduced? Will the financial quagmire that I outlined earlier be made even worse?<br><br>
The Government use vague, pleasant-sounding phrases, but they give us no detail. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey says from a sedentary position, they do not say where the cash will come from. For once, I am in total agreement with the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip—Northwood. The Government have not thought through the PPP plans. They are legislating on the hoof and I suspect that all Committee members are totally
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 764</span>
confused about how to make the proposals work. As we begin the main debate, I hope that the Government will go a little slower and give the Committee more information so that we can do our job.<br><br>
We are discussing new clauses 36 to 38—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh my God, he is only just getting started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) is worried that I am about to make a long speech on the new clauses, but he will be pleased to know that I am not. However, I want to ask the Minister one Question about them. New clause 36 adds a new subsection to section 9 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984. I have no problem with the new clause, which is sensible and somewhat technical. However, I noticed that Section 9 of the 1984 Act refers to giving London Regional Transport—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the usual channels want to conduct business, will they please do so outside the Room, not across my face?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. O'Hara.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 9(3) of the 1984 Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising those powers London Regional Transport may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, provide for employees' share schemes".</p></blockquote>
As a result of their discussions with various interested parties, or as part of their general thinking on such matters, do the Government envisage any role for employee share schemes using the powers in the Act?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The contributions from the hon. Members for Croydon, South, for Ruislip—Northwood and for Kingston and Surbiton seemed to be especially appropriate. I was reminded of the story about the person who listened to a complicated explanation and said that he was none the wiser. The reply to whom was, "No, but you are hopefully better informed." I have never heard such an exercise in overinflated imagination as that to which the Committee was subjected by those hon. Gentlemen. Certainly, they should be given a couple of marks for having overheated imaginations, but their allegations are unfounded. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton alleged that a former chairman of London Transport announced that the public-private partnership was way down on London Transport's list. In fact, London Transport found that PPP would offer significantly better value for money. The best way in which I can deal with those extraordinary contributions is to touch on the central supporting issues and then deal directly with the specific questions asked by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.<br><br>
First, the Government's proposals for a public-private partnership, as a way of attracting to London Underground the vast amounts of money that are needed to carry out modernisations, have been warmly welcomed and endorsed by the people of London. The alternatives presented to them, such as privatisation, received a categoric thumbs down: that was clearly not what the people of London wanted. We have made it abundantly clear that the Government will introduce PPP despite the attempts of the hon. Member for Kingston
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 765</span>
and Surbiton and, I believe, also the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood to perpetuate the ill-founded stories that they read in newspapers that the private sector is not interested in PPP because nothing could be further from the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm whether she anticipates there being any level of grant during the lifetime of the PPP, other than the usual sources of revenue, such as ticketing or from the mayor's other revenue streams?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to grants to transport for London. Clearly, a grant will continue to be paid to TFL, but there will be no specific grant from central Government for the purposes of serving the PPP. That leads me on to my next response to the contributions that we have heard.<br><br>
As the Government have consistently said, we began the process and we will complete it. Best value is of overriding and primary importance to us. The idea that entering into contracts will create a morass of uncertainty for the private sector—</span></p>
<p>10 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.30 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was attempting to make clear how disastrously wrong Opposition Members are in their unwillingness—or perhaps incapacity to understand what I have said about the public-private partnership and the Government's approach and attitude to it. We have made it abundantly clear that the Government will carry the public-private partnership through, and that we are always concerned with best value. We know that our proposals have the support of the people of London, who categorically turned down the previous Administration's privatisation proposals. Given that Administration's lamentable stewardship of the underground for at least a decade, no Exchequer in the world could find the amount of money that the underground system so desperately needs through exclusive recourse to the public purse.<br><br>
I shall touch briefly on some of the questions that hon. Members asked. I have already touched on the erroneous statement by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton with regard to London Transport's approach to our proposals for the PPP. He also asked questions about fare rises. As I am sure he will understand, that will be a matter for the mayor. I did not announce fare rises; I announced fares that were deemed to be part of the modelling for the financing of the PPP.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not all computer buffs and this is an important matter. Did the Minister not say that we could expect fare rises of 1 per cent, above inflation for the next two financial years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was responding to a question from the hon. Member for Croydon, South, and I referred to the financial modelling that was inherent in the choice of the PPP. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That modelling assumed a 1 per cent, increase in fares in 2000–01.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 766</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is becoming difficult for the Chairman to hear contributions and interventions. There should be more silence in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to intervene again. Do the hon. Lady's comments not imply that those figures are, in common parlance, guesstimates, on which the models for the expected returns from the PPP process and operating companies are based? Those figures are not an assurance to Londoners that they can expect fare increases at that level. Given the black hole mat we have identified, the likelihood is that fare increases will be much higher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, what the Opposition perceive as a black hole is the gap between the conclusion of the PPP and the mayor taking over Transport for London. Under the present Government, the people of London have seen fares on the underground increase by precisely 1 per cent, above inflation. That is in marked contrast to annual increases under the previous Administration—on one occasion, the increase was nearly 10 per cent. The previous Administration made promises, year on year, that fares would be frozen, but year on year those promises were categorically broken.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South also mentioned responsibility for fares. Under the infrastructure proposed, fares will be the responsibility of the mayor. He also asked whether the Government believed that a public company would be the right body to administer the operating company. He referred as an example to what he perceived as bad management on the part of London Underground. I found that a somewhat hasty, rushed judgment, given that the new chairman and the new managing director have been in post for only a short time. It is an indication of the deep opposition still felt by those on the Conservative Benches to anything with the word "public" in it. As we know, they are totally and categorically opposed to public service, to public companies. Anything with the word "public" in it is anathema to the hon. Member for Croydon, South.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then referred to the reviews over seven and a half years and linked them to what he saw as an unpicking of contracts, because there will be an arbiter. That matter was also of some concern to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. When we say that there will be a review of the contracts, there will be a review. The hon. Member f or Croydon, South himself touched on one of the reasons why there might need to be a review.<br><br>
We are talking about contracts that will run for 30 years. The hon. Gentleman referred to technological improvements. They will undoubtedly come on stream. A contractor may well be able to say to the mayor at the end of the seven-and-a-half-year review, "The plan that I proposed in our initial contract used this form of technology. We now have a more advanced form of technology. It will be cheaper and more efficient. Would you like me to do it?" The mayor would be unlikely to turn such a proposal down.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0409">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 767</span>
There will also be a requirement on the mayor, within the 30-year contracts, possibly to prioritise certain aspects of the improvements on the network, as they come on stream. The idea floated from the Opposition Benches that an arbiter, or arbitration in a commercial situation, is utterly unheard of is absurd. We are also considering an arbiter only being called upon if there is outright disagreement between two parties.<br><br>
There was much concern about the revenue stream. We have already touched on the fact that there will be no direct grant to the PPP contracts, but there will still be a requirement for other transport activities that will be part of TFL. We have—it is in the Bill and we shall come to the clauses later—the possibility of a dedicated revenue stream to the mayor via hypothecation of congestion charging and a private, non-residential levy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman barks "Tax" at me from a sedentary position. Could I point out, as I am sure his memory has allowed it to slip, that the proposal for congestion charging and a private, non-residential parking levy was part of his Government's Green Paper? That Government considered the possibility, but did not manage to take the amazingly radical step that this Government have taken of ensuring that any such revenues raised will be hypothecated: they will be spent 100 per cent, on improving transport for London.<br><br>
In the light of my response to Opposition Ministers' questions, I ask that the new clauses be accepted as part of the Bill.</span></p>
