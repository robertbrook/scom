	<time>Tuesday 9 March 1999</time>
	<p>	<i>(Afternoon)</i></p>
	<p>	<i>[Part I]</i></p>
	<p>[MR. JOE BENTON 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Greater London Authority Bill</h1></div>
	<p>(Except clauses 1,2, 3, and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we commence the proceedings, I suggest that we take a break from about 7.30 pm to 8.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Benton. This morning, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) raised a slightly dubious point of order. Nevertheless, Mr. Winterton was pleased, in the interests of historical accuracy and information, to listen to the hon. Gentleman talking about the number of amendments that had been tabled and about whether it was a record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done some research and have established that more than 1,100 amendments have been tabled to the Bill so far. If we add the amendments that were discussed on the Floor of the House, we discover that some 1,128 amendments have been tabled. That appears to be an absolute record in terms of comparable legislation from this Department. A total of 1,014 amendments were tabled to the Local Government Act 1986, which abolished the Greater London council, and 976 amendments were tabled to the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which introduced the community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are clearly sailing into the record books, but I have a disappointment for Opposition Members. In recent weeks, they have increasingly stridently voiced their concern about the number of amendments and the difficulties that they have encountered because of them. Opposition Members are, however, largely to blame. Of the more than 1,100 amendments that have been tabled so far, a mere 101 were Government amendments. More than 900—in fact, almost 1,000—were Opposition amendments. It is entirely in the Opposition's hands whether they slow down our race into the record books.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. I want to make two brief points. First, if my general recollection from this morning is correct, I am the only veteran of the Committee that considered the Bill that abolished the GLC. That Committee lasted long enough, but the Minister has confirmed my sense that, in terms of amendments, this one is longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1056</span>
My second point is that the Minister tries to blame the Opposition for the number of amendments—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, he tries to attribute them to the Opposition, but he did not quite answer another question. How many lines' worth of amendments came from the Government as opposed to the Opposition? The longest, most detailed and most complex amendments have come from the Government. We are happy to consider them, but they could have been put in the Bill in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. Surely it is generally the case in the House and in Committee that it is the Opposition's job to seek to amend Bills. I did not realise that it was the Government's job to amend their own Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have had sufficient on that point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Provisions supplementary to paragraph 16</i></p>
	<p>17.—(1) Before making any regulations under paragraph 16(2) above, the Secretary of State shall make an assessment of what he considers to be—
	<ol>
	<li>the likely amounts of net proceeds of charging schemes; and</li>
	<li>the potential for spending such net proceeds on relevant transport purposes which provide value for money.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Before making any such regulations, the Secretary of State shall consult the Authority.</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State may issue guidance to the Authority, Transport for London and the London borough councils with respect to the appraisal of whether any applications of net proceeds of a charging scheme for any purpose provides value for money.</li>

	<li>The Secretary of State may at any time vary the guidance under sub-paragraph (3) above.</li>
	<li>In determining for the purposes of paragraph 16 above when the initial period there mentioned begins or expires in the case of any charging scheme, regulations may make provision as to circumstances in which—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the same charging scheme is to be regarded as continuing in force, notwithstanding the making of amendments or the revocation and replacement (with or without modifications) of a scheme; or</li>
	<li>a different scheme is, or is not, to be regarded as coming into force.</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a pleasure it is to see you back in our Committee, chairing our deliberations, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we adjourned, I had just begun detailing the applications of net proceeds that are to be raised from road user charges and private non-residential parking levies. I intend to set out the arrangements in some detail; I trust that that meets with your approval, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1067</span>
On Second Reading, the Government made it abundantly clear that for at least the next 10 years, every penny of the net proceeds of charging schemes introduced in the Greater London area will be ring-fenced for transport expenditure, and that those arrangements would be reviewed only after 10 years. To put the Government's commitment to hypothecation beyond question, we propose that the arrangements for the application of the net proceeds should be written into the Bill. Paragraph 16 of new schedule 8 makes it clear that all schemes proposed by the mayor or boroughs within 10 years of the GLA's inception will retain 100 per cent, of net proceeds for transport expenditure for 10 years from the implementation of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have included a power to enable the Secretary of State to guarantee the retention of such proceeds for such expenditure for more than 10 years from the implementation of a scheme. That could be especially valuable if, for example, the mayor wanted to undertake a PFI-type deal, and the private sector required a guarantee that the revenues would be available for more than 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the fact that there is a reference in the new schedule to the minimum period. We can argue about whether it should be longer, but we welcome that reference. I accept the Minister's point that the new schedule allows a 10-year period to begin at any time during the first 10 years after the authority comes into existence, and then to run for 10 years—for more than 10 years from next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, will the Minister confirm that paragraph 17 of the new schedule gives the Secretary of State power to stop the money remaining with the GLA if he or she decides that any change in the scheme constitutes a new scheme? Therefore, once the first scheme is put into operation, the only way to guarantee the revenues is for no new incoming mayor for 10 years thereafter to change it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not correct, because any new scheme introduced by a new mayor would take precedence over a preceding scheme. Clearly, there would have to be agreement with the Secretary of State with regard to the broad brush of schemes presented to him by the mayor. We are not expecting the Secretary of State to have to dot every "i" and cross every "t" of the detail of a scheme, but there must be a safeguard to ensure that best value is achieved in spending such revenues to achieve the mayor's transport strategy. Before the completion of a 10-year scheme, an incoming mayor who wanted to introduce an entirely new scheme would have to present it to the Secretary of State for broad-brush approval, but the new scheme would then take precedence over any preceding scheme. It would be deemed to be a new scheme, and would therefore run for 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the second point about a new scheme taking precedence over an old scheme. However, paragraph 17(6) of new schedule 8 as drafted states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1068</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining when the initial period begins or expires regulations"—</p></blockquote>
which will be laid by the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may make provision as to circumstances in which the same charging scheme is to be regarded as continuing in force or a different scheme is, or is not, to be regarded as coming into force."</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State does not deem the second scheme to be a new scheme, that gives him power to foreshorten a 10-year guarantee of revenue funding under the first scheme, and not necessarily replace that funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the powers of the Secretary of State with regard to regulations. Before the Secretary of State could make regulations, he would have to consult the mayor. It would also be necessary for the affirmative resolution procedure to be accorded to such regulations. A Secretary of State would not be able to prevent any changes, but if he or she does not approve of them to the first instance, he or she will be able to tell the mayor that the Government do not deem them to be delivering best value, and to ask for a scheme that the Government can approve. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to intervene a third time. I do not wish to delay her, but I should tell her that the Liberal Democrats believe that the power as drafted gives to the Secretary of State the ultimate say on how long a scheme can fund transport. The Committee will return to the matter, but we disagree about the interpretation of the paragraph in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested in the hon. Gentleman's more detailed arguments about the matter. The purpose of the powers is to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot foreshorten the 10 years of the scheme. The hon. Gentleman referred to circumstances in which a scheme is changed, and becomes in essence a new scheme. If it is a new scheme, it will again be eligible for the full 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now explain the use of net revenues. The new schedule makes it clear that revenue from authority and borough charging schemes will be spent on any measure that directly or indirectly supports the mayor's transport strategy. That strategy will set out how the mayor intends to promote and to encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within Greater London. Providing for charging revenues to be spent on any measure that can help to deliver the objective contained in the transport strategy will ensure that maximum transport benefit is obtained. That means that charging revenues can be spent on cyclists and pedestrians as well as on public transport, which reasserts and reaffirms the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose that a regulation-making power should establish arrangements for the retention and use of changing revenues after 10 years. I have already explained how such regulations could be introduced, in response to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The regulations will cover arrangements for schemes introduced after the first 10 years of the GLA. I should emphasise, however, that they will not have any impact on the guarantee of 100 per cent, retention during

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1069</span>
a scheme's initial period, for schemes started within the first 10 years of the GLA. Paragraph 16 of the new schedule makes that absolutely clear, although I know that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey disagrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before making regulations, the Secretary of State is required to assess how much money will be raised from new charges in future and the potential for spending mat revenue on value-for-money transport purposes. The Secretary of State is also required to consult the authority before making regulations, which will ensure an informed decision. As I said, regulations will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to ensure that only genuinely new schemes attract the 100 per cent, hypothecation arrangements. For example, we would not want a mayor to introduce a scheme in year one of the GLA's lifetime and to seek to make an inconsequential amendment in year nine, arguing mat the revenues should be hypothecated for 10 more years. The new schedule therefore allows the Secretary of State to make regulations determining what constitutes a new or amended scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 18 of the new schedule covers arrangements for how net revenues for charging schemes are to be apportioned between the authority, Transport for London and die boroughs. That enables, for example, net revenues from borough schemes to be paid to the authority or to Transport for London. The mayor will decide how me net revenues are to be split, but in all cases the revenues must be spent on schemes that support the mayor's transport strategy. It is necessary to allow moneys from borough schemes to be paid to me authority, Transport for London or a neighbouring borough because a borough charging scheme could divert traffic into other boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are three or four different conversations going on, which is not fair to me Minister or to other members of the Committee. I must insist that background noise is kept down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Benton. I was referring to the potential that is inherent in hypothecated revenues for a mayor who wishes, for example, to extend London
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1070</span>
underground by introducing a new line. The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) looks as if he wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made it quite clear that the money is ring fenced for 10 years. Frankly, we would not have me scheme at all, but we accept that we are to have it, and that that is progress. The Minister has spoken in debates on past clauses about public-private partnership contracts lasting for up to 30 years. The mayor may want to spend me money over 30 years, but that is not his decision. The money is ring-fenced and available for his use only for 10 years. What will happen for the last 20 years of a 30-year contract?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman again reveals the confusion that clearly rages within him about me PPP. The Government would not enter into a PPP if they believed that it could be effectively achieved only by the exclusive use of revenues raised from hypothecation. We have made it abundantly clear that we will conclude a PPP only in the clear understanding that it delivers best value not only for the taxpayer but in terms of improving London Underground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman consistently ignores me responsibilities of the mayor in relation to Transport for London, which include the buses, the river, the mayoral roads, me docklands light railway and the Croydon tram link. The potential for improvements in those existing transport schemes is abundantly clear. I am sure that Londoners would like to know that me hon. Gentleman—I presume he speaks for his party—is opposed to this innovative scheme, which will help to tackle London's transport problems and, at the same time, inevitably reduce congestion on our streets and improve the quality of the air that we breathe. The Conservative party is clearly opposed to such improvements in the quality of life in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that Liberal Democrat Members support the principle of the scheme and therefore share her view that to reject it out of hand is foolish. However, I should like to ask about me issue that was raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. Does the Minister envisage that, either in me first 10 years or thereafter, it will be necessary for the revenue stream from road charging to be used as part of the money that pays for the PPP, or will it be raised entirely from the fares of people who travel on the underground?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mat, as I said to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, the Government will not enter into a PPP unless we are sure that me PPP is in me best public interest and affords me best value—not only for me taxpayer—in delivering transport services for London. However, I will not say that me mayor will be precluded from using the hypothecated revenues from charging to bring additional improvements to the London underground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the potential for technological advances during the 30 years about which we are talking. Let us say, for instance, that the incumbent mayor wished
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1071</span>
to speed up a programme to make the entire London underground accessible to people with disabilities. It would be entirely within the mayor's powers to enter into, for example, a PFI deal—perhaps with a contractor who was already engaged—and use hypothecated revenues for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from that. However, if the Minister steps back one question, would it also be possible for the mayor to use the hypothecated road charging revenues not for an additional bit of work as the subject of an additional contract, but to fund Transport for London's element of the contractual dues that it must pay as its part of the public-private partnerships?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, I cannot conceive of such a requirement being placed on the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made our approach to a public-private partnership abundantly clear. The detail of the contracts for which the private sector will have to bid and the competition will all come within that overriding consideration of Government—best value. However, I cannot guarantee—nor can any member of the Committee or, indeed, any Member of the entire House of Commons—that nothing would happen between the inception and conclusion of a PPP over a possible 30 years that had not been considered. For example, there could be a major collapse of a tunnel, although that is highly unlikely. In those circumstances, it would be entirely right and proper for the mayor to make a contribution to that. We are clear, however, that we are not setting up a situation whereby the overwhelming burden of risk will at any stage, from the beginning to the end of a contract, be borne by the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was very helpful. We are trying to understand the Government's mind. I understand exactly what the Minister said, but I want to take her one further step back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does she agree that given all the normal expectations of the contract when it is entered into, and given above all that it will, as she tells us, be signed between Government and the private sector and not between the authority and the private sector, all the normal expectations of the GLA's liability will not be met—or be expected to be met—from the revenue streams from charging? If that is the case, will the Minister at least consider writing it into the Bill at a later stage so that there is clarity on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's assessment was correct. It is based on the modelling on which the definition of the contract will be based. But no, I most certainly will not come back with an amendment which puts that on the face of the Bill. That would be giving a wild card to the private sector in exactly the same way as setting some artificial concluding date would. We are committed to ensuring mat the PPP is conducted on the understanding that the Government will secure a deal that is best value and in the best interests of the underground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that she will appear to Londoners to be steaming away from her party's engagement to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1072</span>
electorate under the cover of smoke about best value? They will believe that because these charging powers exist for the mayoralty, the deficiency in the financing of the underground—which is plain for all to see because there is no timetable for the implementation of the public-private partnership—could be made up at the expense of motorists in London. That was not the deal mat was sold to the electorate during the referendum campaign or, for that matter, during the general election campaign before it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon. Gentleman's contribution extraordinary, given that there was a clear manifesto commitment to the public-private partnership, which the people of London overwhelmingly endorsed. We have made abundantly clear our proposals and the use that will be made on congestion charging and the use that will be made of those revenues—for the first time, I believe. Again, the people of London have overwhelmingly endorsed the clear hypothecation of those revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the people of London are under no illusions as to which Government have the well-being of London and Londoners and, indeed, of London Underground, most central to their thinking. It is clearly this Government. The people of London know full well that the previous Administration failed for more than a decade to fund London Underground adequately. They know that the only solution to London Underground's problems that the previous Administration could proffer was to privatise it. It was proposed that it should be a third of its size for that privatisation. There was no guarantee—actually, mere was a guarantee, because the then Secretary of State for Transport told the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that post privatisation, under the previous Administration's scheme, there would be a requirement for millions of pounds of public money still to be paid in to London Underground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Londoners can have no doubt which Administration is most cognisant of the need to fund transport. Post the comprehensive spending review, an additional £1.8 billion was given to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. An additional £700 million was provided for local authority transport. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave an assurance that there would be an additional £50 million year on year, for three years, targeted specifically for the introduction of new rural bus services. There can be no doubt in the minds of the people of London, or of anyone in the United Kingdom, which Government are most committed to creating an integrated transport system nationally and to ensuring that London and Londoners have the sort of transport system that this great city deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was there, spirited away in any of the press releases on today's Budget, an explanation of where funding is coming from for the underground for the next three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regrettably, it was not open to me to be present in the Chamber this afternoon when my right hon.

methods by which the Government are ensuring the economy of the country, and ensuring that everyone will benefit from our economic and fiscal policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman turns his attention to the Red Book, I am sure that he will find the details in which he is interested. I am happy to attempt to find that detail but not, I regret, before we conclude our deliberations this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could say that she does not know and save a lot of time. I am not quite sure whether that is what she is saying. Is she saying that I will find it if I look for it and—tee hee—I should go and find it, or that she does not know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to take no lessons from the hon. Gentleman in the best use of my time. I am not in a position to know, because I was not present in the Chamber. Regrettably, I missed yet another triumph for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, and will have to enjoy it when is is reported on our television screens this evening. As I said to the hon. Gentleman, I am perfectly prepared to attempt to find out, but not before the Committee adjourns this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can reassure the Minister that had she been in the Chamber, she would have been no more enlightened.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is coming somewhat late to that concern. That is yet another demonstration of the fact that the Conservative party does not have the best interests of London and Londoners at heart. I have had occasion to say that in response to such questions before the issue of the budget arose. The Government are addressing that issue, and there is no question of our allowing the sort of black hole scenario that is the favourite of the Conservative party to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was touching on the apportionment of net proceeds, and had mentioned that it will be necessary to allow moneys from borough schemes to be paid to the authority, to Transport for London or to a neighbouring borough, because a borough charging scheme could divert traffic into other boroughs. That means that some of the net revenues may need to be spent outside the borough—on traffic management measures, for example—or on improving alternatives to an overdependence on the car in that borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 19 to 22 contain the arrangements for setting out and approving the spending of the net revenues from road user charging schemes. That will ensure that Londoners know exactly how charging revenues are to be spent. The new schedule requires the charging authority— whether Transport for London or a borough—to set out its 10-year plan of expenditure before a charging scheme starts. The charging authority is then required to produce four-year expenditure programmes every four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1074</span>
The mayor must produce similar plans and programmes for any portion of the proceeds that is not kept by the charging authority. The Secretary of State will approve those plans and programmes. In addition, the mayor will approve the borough's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process will ensure that potentially large sums of money are spent on value-for-money transport measures that are consistent with the Government's national integrated transport policy and the mayor's transport strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 17 of new schedule 8 also provides for the Secretary of State to issue statutory guidance on the appraisal framework that the authority and boroughs should use when deciding how net charging revenues should be spent. That will ensure that the moneys are spent on the transport measures that deliver the greatest benefits to Londoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Road users charging can—and undoubtedly will—directly tackle London's traffic problems. These ground-breaking arrangements for the application of the net proceeds to transport purposes will also help to provide the solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that paragraph 17(3) provides statutory guidance. Will she confirm that the guidance given will not actually be guidance, because the next paragraph states that it shall be complied with? It will be guidance with which the London authority will have no option but to comply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot conceive of a situation in which such guidance would not be conducive to delivering what will no doubt be part not only of the national integrated transport strategy but of the mayor's transport strategy. It will ensure best value in delivering those strategies. We are discussing the potential to raise sizeable amounts of money; it is only right and proper that such guidance should be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms that we have a difference of view. "Guidance" here is not guidance in the normal sense of the word. If I gave her guidance or she gave me guidance, we would both be free to choose not to follow it. What is provided here is an obligation. That means that the GLA will be able to introduce road charging only to the extent that the Secretary of State of the day agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is incorrect yet again. What I have been at some pains to point out, but will reiterate, is that the type of approval that the Secretary of State must give, and to which the hon. Gentleman refers, is a broad-brush approval. We do not expect the mayor to go to the Secretary of State with a detailed scheme that has every "i" dotted and every "t" crossed. However, it is only right and proper, and reaffirms Government policy, that the principle of best value should apply to the schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That principle will apply throughout the country. The implementation plans of the London boroughs will be within the overarching framework, as they have been for the past two years, to ensure that the Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1075</span>
approach to integrated transport is adopted and that the prioritisation of transport needs will be carried out. The detail of how the mayor's transport strategy is to be achieved will clearly be for the mayor and for the boroughs working together to decide. In many instances, the delivery of the mayoral strategy will depend upon the boroughs implementing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats believe that the Government's approach is inconsistent, which is why we are pursuing the matter. I may have missed something, but when, for example, my local authority, Southwark, decides on its parking regime and on how much it charges people to park on the street, it does not have to come to the Government for permission. It allocates the revenue into its internal resources to spend as it thinks fit. The new Londonwide authority is defined by the Government in law as a local government authority, but its use of the new revenue stream requires the agreement of the Secretary of State, which is a different procedure from that which applies in any other area. There is no logic in deciding that an integrated national transport policy should ensure that London can have a road charging scheme but also that the Secretary of State should decide what the scheme is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Gentleman is incorrect. He referred to revenue from parking, which is available to all London boroughs. It is not available to them to spend on just anything—they have to spend it on issues directly related to transport. Why is that any different to what a Secretary of State will say to a mayor about use of the revenues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I should point out the difference. Southwark, the Minister's borough of Camden or my hon. Friend's borough of Sutton may decide to introduce a parking levy on meters—20p for 10 minutes, or whatever other price—and will have to keep it. The GLA can decide on a road charging scheme that it will keep, but the difference is that it will have to seek approval elsewhere. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister says that the authority will not have to do so. Will she therefore change the Bill, so that it will clearly be entirely up to the mayor to decide the charging regime, without having to seek the approval of the Secretary of State of the day and without having to go to Marsham street or to the replacement office at the end of Victoria street?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the relationship that I have described. As I said, the Secretary of state will appraise the value-for-money schemes, but it will not be for the Secretary of State to say yes to every detail of a mayoral strategy. That Bill clearly ensures that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to clarifying arrangements for the use and application of net proceeds, we have set out arrangements for the accounts and funds associated with new charges. For the benefit of the mayor—I apologise, I mean the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke)—I should point out that paragraph 15 of the new schedule sets out the details, and contains the requirement for charging authorities to keep separate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1076</span>
accounts for each scheme that they operate, and to publish those accounts annually. That will ensure the accountability of charging authorities to Londoners, and makes transparent what is coming into and out of an account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That transparency will enable Londoners to see that charging revenues are additional moneys for spending on transport in support of the mayor's transport strategy. Published accounts will show Londoners how much money has been raised and what it is being spent on. They will rightly want to know that, and we are ensuring that they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that schemes are accountable. Motorists who pay the charges will rightly want to know what is being done with the money raised. We are ensuring that that information will be available. If a charging scheme incurs a deficit in its early years, while it is being set up, that deficit will be made good from the authority's general fund. When schemes begin to record surpluses, they must make good any borrowing made from that general fund within the past four years. Remaining surpluses can be carried forward into the next financial year, and ring fencing of the account ensures that no money can leak away to other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new schedule includes provisions to allow the charging authorities control and flexibility in setting up charging schemes. We have provided for charging authorities to incur expenses in setting up schemes. They will, for example, be able to consider long-term investment in technology with private sector partners who would initially invest in the scheme's infrastructure and be repaid from later revenues from the scheme. A PFI-type arrangement could also provide an opportunity to improve transport services and facilities ahead of the introduction of a charging scheme. Such freedom to explore the best way in which to implement a scheme is surely in the best interests of Londoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the important financial issues that are contained in the new schedule. I want to deal now with several provisions that are designed to aid charging authorities in introducing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New schedule 8 enables charging authorities to introduce road user charging schemes if a scheme can directly or indirectly help to deliver the policies and programmes that are contained in the mayor's transport strategy. That will give the mayor and boroughs maximum flexibility to introduce charging schemes that can deliver transport objectives. That will be to the benefit of London and Londoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All charging schemes must conform to the mayor's transport strategy. That will ensure that schemes support the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities to, from and within Greater London. In order that schemes are transparent and understandable, the new schedule requires them to specify the charging area, the roads charged, the level of charge and the type of vehicles that are covered by the scheme. The level of charge may change, depending on the day, the time of day, the class of vehicle, and the particular part of the charging area. I should make it clear that those decisions will be for charging authorities to make and for the mayor to approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1077</span>
We also propose to allow charging authorities to determine the duration of a charging scheme. By removing the references to regulations that surround many of these issues, we are fulfilling our commitment to a strong mayor for London. The mayor should have the freedom to decide how best to introduce an order that contains a charging scheme and the mechanisms and new arrangements that will form part of that process. The new schedule allows that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also ensured that the mayor will have a specific power to consult, or to require charging authorities to consult, when introducing charging schemes. A charging scheme would necessarily be an important element of the mayor's transport strategy or of a borough's local implementation plan, and boroughs will, again, be required to consult on such a scheme. There will, therefore, be an opportunity for views to be expressed on charging proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would expect the mayor to want to undertake further consultation on the details of particular schemes. That will encourage the successful development and implementation of schemes that are adapted to the needs and circumstances of Londoners. It will encourage charging authorities to be accountable for the schemes that they introduce. We do not, however, propose to specify which organisations must be consulted. That will be a decision for London's democratically accountable mayor and boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor must be able to deliver an integrated approach across London. He or she must, therefore, be able to ensure consistency and compatibility between any borough schemes and with any TfL scheme. The schedule therefore gives the mayor the opportunity to specify which aspects of charging schemes, if any, he or she would want formally to approve as schemes are developed. That will help to ensure consistency across schemes, where the mayor considers that necessary, while allowing charging authorities the freedom to take decisions on other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may also be necessary for the mayor to be able to ensure that boroughs implement measures to support charging schemes. For example, a borough outside a charging area may be required to put in traffic management measures to deal with traffic. We are, therefore, giving the mayor a power to direct boroughs to use their charging powers or any of their traffic management and control powers if they are needed to support a charging scheme. The power is entirely in keeping with our proposal for a strong and effective mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor is also granted power to issue guidance on charging schemes, which TfL and the boroughs must follow. That will enable the mayor to communicate key features or aspects of schemes that are needed for consistency across London and with the integrated transport strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced a safeguard for motorists to prevent them from being charged by both TfL and a borough on a single stretch of road. We have simplified the relationship between the various highway and traffic authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1078</span>
The new schedule contains provisions for regulations to be made covering the administration and enforcement of road user charging schemes. It is essential that the mayor and boroughs have adequate enforcement powers if they are to be able to make a road user charging scheme work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear in the Bill that charging schemes will not apply to vehicles within charging areas but which are not on the road. That applies not only to charges levied but also to the differing enforcement options open to charging authorities, such as immobilisation. It is clearly right that measures combat congestion on the road do not apply to vehicles off it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also make it clear that the non-payment of a charge will be a civil offence and that the registered keeper of a vehicle will be responsible for paying charges and penalty charges. A deliberate attempt to avoid paying road user charges will, however, be a criminal offence. Such offences and the penalties for them are written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new schedule applies to Crown roads as to all other roads and ensures that Crown roads may be included in the scope of Transport for London or borough charging schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, new schedule 8 provides a framework within which London's mayor and boroughs will bring forward road user charging schemes. It ensures that such schemes can be introduced quickly and that they will be able to operate effectively and equitably. It also ensures that the proceeds of those schemes will be retained for the benefit of Londoners for at least 10 years and that they can be spent on improving London's transport system.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We will be voting against clause 200 and new schedule 8 in this Committee. I cannot make it clearer than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I happen to be the spokesman of the Tory party.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Liberal Democrat policy, both nationally and in London, that the Greater London authority should have the power to bring in a road charging scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Karen Buck 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Regent's Park and Kensington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has stressed the importance of giving the boroughs a key role to play. Westminster city council—a Conservative borough in the heart of London, with probably the greatest traffic pressure of any local authority in the city—has made it clear that it cannot wait for road user charges to be brought in. I have a copy of a letter from the leader of my local council. In it, he criticises the Government for not bringing in those powers early enough to allow Westminster city council to introduce road user charging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the letter, but I am pretty sure that I know what it says because I have had a conversation with Councillor Caplan on just that point. It says that it cannot be brought in cold, in isolation, but must be brought in with the consideration of a number of different aspects—not least that the London underground could not cope with the increase in passenger traffic if road-user charging was introduced. I should like to make it clear to the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who spends a great deal of time attacking her own local authority, that Westminster city council does not support the proposal as it stands. Well, that was a pretty good opening sentence. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]

You and your co-Chairmen, Mr. Benton, have wisely chosen to group an extensive selection of amendments with new schedule 8. A number of different aspects of the charge must therefore be discussed. With the Committee's tolerance, I shall deal with the amendments before turning to our central opposition to the principle of the road-user charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) suggests that the mayor should not introduce a scheme without the approval of the assembly. We have made it quite clear that we distance ourselves from the Liberal approach—they want the assembly to be the legislature operating with the mayor. They have asked for the assembly to monitor almost everything that the mayor does. The Government are right to resist that. However, this is the big one. The Government cannot introduce a new tax on the people of London without a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1080</span>
democratic process—there should be no taxation without representation. To leave that power solely in the mayor's discretion, without the involvement of the assembly, is a breach of the democratic principles of this country at which Conservative Members have to draw the line. Such substantial measures must not be introduced without the support of the assembly. What is the point of the constituency assembly men? Whom are they representing? What is their standing? While they are there speaking for people in their constituencies, the Londonwide members will be speaking for the whole of London. They will not be allowed to have a say on this most important of central issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the assembly has the power through its ability to control the budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The budget is a much wider thing. One could say that about central Government—if the Budget were to be defeated, the whole Government would fall. A Conservative group—almost certainly, all parties in the assembly will be minority parties—may want to support everything in the budget except road user charging. There is no way of doing that other than the something and bust policy of voting down the whole budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know from the Committee's debates on part III of the Bill, when we discussed the budget, that the assembly has no power to vote down the budget—its power is to amend the budget. It could amend a budget by specifically changing provisions that relate to road user charging. The point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) is therefore absolutely correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, what is the problem with accepting the amendment? If the Minister is saying that the assembly has the power, the Government should not object to the amendment. It would give clarity to the whole democratic process. I think that the Minister was out of the Room—I beg his pardon if he was not—when I made the fundamental point that the purpose of the constituency assembly men is to act as the representatives of the people, and that that is a proper exercise of democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (c) is a small amendment to the provisions of paragraph 4(1) on making a charging scheme. That paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any charging scheme must be contained in an order—(a) made under this Schedule by the authority making the scheme".</p></blockquote>
I tabled this simply as a probing amendment, but in my reading of the new schedule there is no definition of authority. I am pretty sure that I know what is meant, but those entitled to make a charges scheme are defined as "bodies", not the "authority", with a small "a". As the amendment has been tabled for some days, I imagine that the Minister has a response to that point, and I draw it to her attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (d) relates to the fact that under the new schedule, the boroughs cannot introduce a charging scheme without the approval of the mayor. In our judgment, what goes on in the borough of Croydon is a matter for the borough of Croydon. Although it is obvious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1081</span>
that boroughs have to draw up their scheme in line with the mayor's strategic policy, we believe that he should not have a veto over how the scheme is ran in Croydon. They may choose to put a particular slant on it which the mayor may not like. For him to have the ultimate veto is not acceptable to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arrangements are that under paragraph (9), Transport for London can introduce a charging scheme in any area. Under proposed amendments (g) and (h) to the new schedule, the scheme would apply to non-residential areas. Again, we ask what is the point of a charging scheme? Is the Minister trying to introduce a user charge in residential areas? She will no doubt respond that if there is not a problem, such a charge will not be introduced. But that is not what the new schedule provides. It is quite possible that people could be taxed to get home, and that would be an unacceptable state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to go back to amendment (c). I know that an awful lot of words and waffle have gone under the bridge since we debated clause 2, but the amendment clearly defines the authority as the mayor and the assembly. Paragraph (2) of the new schedule says that the authority—the mayor and the assembly, as defined in clause 2—and any functions designated to it by the new schedule will be carried out by the mayor on behalf of the authority. It is very clear and, as ever, the amendment is redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is, as ever, trying to be helpful, but he is referring to a definition of "authority" with a capital A. This is "authority" with a small a. I tabled this as a probing amendment, because the wording is confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that the one amendment that the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) can try and pick me up on is a drafting one about whether "authority" should be written with a capital A or a small one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what they are like in Harrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is about the level of political debate in Harrow, I suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment (j). As the new schedule stands, when a scheme is set up, any losses can be carried forward and set against future profit. If a scheme takes 10 years to ran into a surplus, that profit in the 10th year can be used to offset the losses in the early years, but only for the four years prior to going into profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having visited Singapore to look at how road user schemes work, I know that the only type of scheme that will make sense and achieve the Government's objective is an electronic one. In Singapore, 28 gantries cover the city area and cost hundreds of millions of pounds. A scheme with 28 gantries would be inadequate for London, so we are talking about a substantial sum. It should be possible to offset losses against future profits for longer than four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who paid for the hon. Gentleman to go to Singapore: did he pay for himself; did his party pay; or was it someone whom he should have declared in the Register of Members' Interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I paid for myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (aa) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"charges shall not apply on any day on which any part of the underground, bus or suburban rail networks are disrupted or closed by industrial action."</p></blockquote>
It is commonplace for London Transport unions to go on strike because the Government are unable to agree terms. People are forced to resort to their own means of transport, and we believe that they should not be charged on those days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments (bb) and (cc) relate to exemptions for emergency services and orange badge holders. The amendments speak for themselves. No doubt the Minister will say that it is a matter for the mayor and, having heard her earlier explanation, I suspect that that is probably right. Nevertheless, we believe that orange badge holders should be exempt, and I hope that the Minister will endorse the sentiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a brief canter through the amendments—I skipped over one or two that have been covered. Until I hear the Minister's explanation, I want to put down markers that signal our intention to divide on amendment (b), which deals with assembly approval, amendment (k), which relates to ring-fencing for 10 years and possibly on amendments (aa) and (bb), which are concerned with disruption on the underground by industrial workers and with orange badge holders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I shall explain the fundamental thrust of the Conservative party and why we oppose the principle of road-user charging. We made it clear in 1995 that we were prepared to consider introducing congestion charging. The Minister has drawn our attention to the presumption in the Green Paper that we would introduce congestion charging. But that was merely a Green Paper. It was a consultation document, not a White Paper. A presumption is rebuttable, and that is what happened. As a result of the publication of the Green Paper, we consulted and decided not to proceed. That is why the proposal was not in the Conservative party's 1997 manifesto. It is worth making that clear before there is any distortion of what was said and what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had we introduced legislation, it would have been on a national basis, not a local basis. We do not rule out the principle that the Conservative party may, some time in the future, after consultation, introduce road charging on a national basis. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] We will not introduce it on a borough basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear the Minister speak about the possibility of introducing road charging in the area around Heathrow. Anyone who looks at the map will know that Heathrow straddles the London boundary, so road user charging could be introduced on one side of Heathrow but not on the other. In my constituency, as one leaves the southern borough of Croydon one enters Caterham, which has just as many traffic problems as Croydon. We can

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1083</span>
introduce road user charging in Croydon, but not in Caterham. It does not make sense just to introduce it on a local basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the examples that the hon. Gentleman gave, it would be entirely possible for such revenues to be used to assist contingent boroughs in guarding against, for example, an excess of traffic being diverted on to their roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine, but I am not sure how the people of Croydon would feel about their road tax being used to sort out Caterham's traffic problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the people of Croydon would welcome the fact that such assistance from a contingent borough would also apply to them if the introduction of a scheme in Croydon was not part of the mayoral strategy—although it is hard to imagine such a strategy. Clearly, however, it would not be part and parcel of any mayoral strategy to enter into a sort of beggar-my-neighbour policy in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in for a big surprise if she thinks that the people of London will welcome road-user charging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They already have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then all I can say is that the hon. Lady is in for an even bigger surprise. I hope that the Labour and Liberal candidates are campaigning in full flood for the introduction of road-user charging. I look forward to escorting a Conservative mayoral candidate into the egg—the new building—when it has finally opened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that if we are to institute road-user charging, London is the last place where we should do it. It is utterly inappropriate for London to be used as a pilot scheme for the rest of the country. For a start, the statistics show that the number of cars per household in London is relatively low when compared with the rest of the country. There are far better places than London in which to try out such a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, such a scheme would be difficult to implement in London. The Minister made it perfectly clear in this morning's debate that clause 200 contains the word "keep" because the Government will want to introduce a paper-based scheme in a number of areas. However, she will know that in Singapore they abandoned the paper-based scheme because it did not work and did not achieve the effects that the Minister would want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effects of introducing road-user charging in London are unknown. The impact on congestion round the edges of the scheme will be significant. Worst of all, the scheme will set borough against borough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it will not, but I do not know how on earth she knows that. My right hon. Friend the Member or Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) will know as well as I that the two rival
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1084</span>
shopping areas in south London are Bromley and Croydon. If the mayor dumps a congestion tax on Croydon but not on Bromley, Croydon will be up in arms about it while Bromley will be popping the champagne corks because everyone will go there to shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the problem then occurs in Bromley, it could be tackled in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government Whip highlights the problem. Further congestion will be caused. The moment we start to tinker like this, we ruin local economies. Setting the boroughs against one another will affect local economies. Furthermore, we are unlikely to solve the problems of congestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government know from current private schemes that it will take a charge well in excess of £6 to change the driving habits of a motorist going into London. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North will know that it now costs nearly £4 an hour to park in the west end. Guys driving there think nothing of paying £20 or £30 a day to drive to the west end and park; another tenner on top of that will be absolutely nothing to them. Introducing a £5 charge on motorists will not significantly affect traffic congestion, so extra funding will be drawn from the London economy for no tangible benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arbitrary nature of the imposition of the scheme means that it will affect mothers driving their children to school. We have already mentioned the disabled; and there are nurses going to the night shift who will not want to use public transport. Those whom the scheme will affect will be those right on the edge—the low paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Budget debate today, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said that the people whom the Labour party tend to spend most of its time attacking are those who most people perceive that it is there to protect—the low paid. The whole point of the history of the Labour party is that it is there to protect the underprivileged. The people who will be most affected will be those who can just about afford to get some old banger on the road to get to work; that is the cheapest form of transport that they can get.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that my hon. Friend is aware that Greater London at present heads the list of all regions in the country for the largest number of bangers. At present, 12 per cent, of the cars licensed in Greater London fall into that category. That reinforces and sustains my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I turn to the proceeds from the congestion charge, which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and I spent a lot of time discussing with the Minister earlier. We finally got from the Minister a perfectly clear picture of what will happen to the proceeds. Ring-fencing is worthless unless the question of additionality is addressed—many of us made that point at the outset. The Minister may feel that she gave me a straight answer about what happens to to the proceeds—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the Minister did not give a clear answer about what will happen to the proceeds from the congestion tax after 10 years. That matter appears to be absolutely fluid at present; the money could well go to the Treasury, or to something else, as directed by the Secretary of State. One tiling is clear: what happens in 10 years' time will not be the mayor's decision; it will be those outside the assembly and the authority who will decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Ring-fencing nothing will add nothing to the mayor's budget. Given that the Conservatives have also said that under them, the council tax for the mayor would rise by only the retail prices index each year—they proposed that in an earlier amendment—if there were to be a Conservative mayor, from where would he receive any resources? The Conservative party is shutting off all revenue streams to the mayor.

I believe that the Opposition are right about privatising London Underground, and that the Government are wrong in pursuing their now chaotic PPP. I have never been quite sure where the Liberals stand on the matter, but one thing is sure: they are not in favour of privatising the underground. I suspect that they want to simply leave it where it is, which confirms what I have always thought—they are the most left-wing of the current political parties.

The Opposition believe that road user charging and the congestion tax are an attack on London's motorists. Eighty-three per cent, of the public already use public transport to commute into London. The remaining 17 per cent, comprise lorries, vans and commercial vehicles. One has only to go to Oxford street, where private cars are banned, to realise that it is not cars that cause pollution problems, but commercial vehicles. Oxford street is the most polluted street in the country. The amount of pollution from the motor car is 5 per cent, of that of 20 years ago. It is possible to go even further than that, and to produce the perfectly clean car. I congratulate the Government on the policy introduced in the previous Budget to give tax relief on liquified petroleum gas cars. The Chancellor said this morning that the Government

Friend said about off the street, may I establish whether there is a common view across the Committee on one point? When my hon. Friend refers to cars and commercial vehicles, is he classifying taxis in the latter category and not in the former? Taxis are entitled to use off the street, and the 20 per cent, of them that are not properly maintained are very heavy polluters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree with my right hon. Friend. One sees London taxis belching out pollution; they make a significant contribution to pollution levels.

The congestion tax—road user charging—is a tax on the people of London. At the petrol pump, they are already paying £8.60 in tax for every £10 that they pay, and that has probably increased this afternoon. In this Parliament, the motorist is being fleeced of £9 billion with no improvement whatever in public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Benton. As it is now 7.10 pm, are you minded that we should have a break? My preoccupation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. An announcement was made at the beginning of our sitting, although I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman was here.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, the Government Whip adjourned the Committee at 4.42 pm on Thursday 4 March.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That that is a matter for the usual channels. The point of order was about a break.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, on that point, we might not reach the two other big debates on charging by the 9.50 pm guillotine. The point raised by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) should prompt us to consider what we do thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1088</span>
Secondly, the debate is about whether to allow the GLA and London local authorities to have road-user charging. I will contain my remarks to the power of the GLA. As my hon. Friends made clear to the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Croydon, South, and to the Ministers, we support the principle that the power should be given to the GLA—it should not be imposed on it or insisted on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Croydon, South was informative and entertaining. First, he is now on the record as saying that it is Tory policy in London to be against road-user charging. The Minister for Transport in London under the previous Administration, Steven Norris, gave an interview in this month's 	<i>Capital Transport Bulletin.</i> He was asked whether he supported congestion charges and parking taxes as ways of raising revenue. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I support road user charging because I believe it can reduce traffic volume 	<i>and</i> raise revenue to provide the public transport improvements that we desperately need."</p></blockquote>
That is clearly contrary to Conservative policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will understand that the elected Member of the House of Commons who serves as the Front-Bench spokesman on London for the Conservative party—namely my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South—is the individual who lays down our party's policy for London. He is not an individual who happened to be a Minister in the previous Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The shadow Minister for London, who is also one of the shadow transport Ministers, has said that his party is against road-user charging in London. I was merely pointing out that one of the most well-known possible contenders for the mayoralty of London has the opposite view. We will watch this space with interest. Either Steven Norris will have to change his view if he wants to become a candidate or Tory party policy will not be obligatory for Tory party candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second interesting point about the Conservative party's approach was that the shadow Conservative Minister said that it would not in future be against road charging nationally—a very interesting development— and that London would be the last place where it would implement such a scheme. That seems a back-to-front policy. Congestion in Britain is normally greatest in the urban areas, especially in the capital. Therefore, the logical place to introduce such a scheme is the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if road user charging is not introduced and this revenue stream is rejected—I assume from the amendments that the Conservatives want to reject the next revenue stream proposed, which is workplace charging, and that they might oppose the third one, which my hon. Friends and I have proposed—where will the money come from? If there is no independent way of raising money, or semi-independent way, as we would call it—that is because we think that it is under the control of the Secretary of State—and if the GLA is to be capped, with the Secretary of State deciding how much money it gets, the mayor will be unable to obtain revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "light touch" is a great exaggeration of power. The mayor will be unable to do anything unless the Government of the day agree. If the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1089</span>
Croydon, South thinks that he is going to escort a Tory mayor into the building to be erected in my constituency or any other building on the basis that he or she will have no power to do anything, and that that is the Tory policy, he is mistaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huges</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that we shall see. Of course we will. I am simply flagging up the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one qualification. The shadow Minister for London said that there will be some revenue, which will come from privatising the tube. The Tories were in power from 1979 to 1997, and they did not privatise the tube in all that time. Indeed, they nationalised it, then they never privatised it. There are not many people in London who believe that privatising the tube is the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have a different view from the Government, my hon. Friends and I have always argued that there should be a public-private partnership of type—what we call a public interest company. We have, in part, in this Committee and elsewhere, elaborated how we think that that would work on models around the world, and we shall continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party has proposed having a mayor with no power and no money, unless the tube is privatised. That is not a policy which, going by all the opinion polls and current evidence, will commend itself to the London electorate this year, or in the elections in May 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify our position, we do not think that the underground should be a part of the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. If that is the case, any money from privatising the tube, which is currently in public ownership, will not be going to a dedicated London revenue stream ether. So goodness knows what the mayor will have. Some people criticise us for having 1p which goes a long way. The mayor will not have nay pennies to go anywhere. Although the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will no doubt be happy about mat, I do not think that that is what Londoners want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I will support the Government amendment and new schedule because we believe mat whoever comes to power in London should be able to implement a road-user charging scheme. We shall take the same approach in relation to workplace residential parking. That does not mean that it will be easy or that getting it right is not complex. We should get the best advice from other parts of the world, using other examples where it has been tried and learning from the examples in Singapore and elsewhere. It will not necessarily happen overnight. It will, and can, happen only when careful consideration has been given to how best to achieve the objective of reducing private transport appropriately while supporting public transport appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have various criticisms. First, although we welcome the concession, which is now in the Bill in the form of the new schedule, that there will be a 10-year
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1090</span>
period of guaranteed revenue stream, we think that if there is to be a 30-year contract for the PPP there should also be a 30-year guarantee. We foresee big problems if that is to be the case, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) alluded earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and 20 of the new schedule appear to give the Secretary of State huge powers to control the mayor. Paragraph 16(1) refers to the initial period of the scheme, which it defines as being for the first 10 years. In relation to paragraph 16(7), that definition means that there cannot be another scheme under the Bill, because the powers in paragraph 16 relate only to an initial scheme for a period of 10 years. I agree that if an authority did not start the scheme until year nine it could then run for 10 years. However, the Bill does not allow for a second scheme, following a scheme mat was started in the first 10 years, to be decided on by the mayor—certainly not without the approval of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, paragraphs 17, 19 and 20 all require the Secretary of State to approve what the GLA does. The wording of paragraph 17(3) is a bit odd. It requires the Secretary of State to issue guidance.
	<br><blockquote><p>"with respect to the appraisal of whether any application of net proceeds of a charging scheme for any purpose provides value for money."</p></blockquote>
That is a slightly odd piece of English. Paragraph 17(4) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Authority…and any London borough council shall comply with any guidance".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 17(6) states that if there is to be a change in the charging scheme when the initial period begins or expires, regulations, which will be made by the Secretary of State, may make provision as to whether or when that change is to be defined as a new scheme. Having looked at it carefully, we believe that if the GLA proposed a change of scheme to the Secretary of State and, for whatever reason, the Secretary of State did not accept it, that would immediately end the initial period and the dedicated revenue stream. There is no provision to guarantee that the next scheme can have dedicated revenue going to London Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, confirmation of the view that the Secretary of State, rather than the mayor, is the power behind the throne is to be found in paragraphs 19 and 20. The charging scheme must have a statement of the general plan for applying the authority's share of the proceeds during the opening 10-year period, and has under paragraph 19(3) to be approved by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 20(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As long as a charging scheme remains in force",</p></blockquote>
the GLA—it applies equally to boroughs—have to
	<br><blockquote><p>"prepare a written statement of their proposed general programme for applying the authority's share of the net proceeds of the scheme during the next four financial years",</p></blockquote>
which must be submitted "for approval"—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline those words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, at every turn the Secretary of State calls the shots, decides on the scheme, gives it approval and allows it to continue, and not the mayor or the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1091</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw my hon. Friend back to what he was saying about paragraph 17, and particularly (6)(b), which is important to his argument. The Secretary of State can decide whether the mayor has changed a charging scheme by regulation. Therefore, once we come to the second set of elections, a new mayor who makes a fairly small change to a charging scheme may be deemed by the Secretary of State to have created a completely new scheme. In such a case the 10-year ring-fencing of the revenues from congestion charges will be deemed to be no longer valid. The concern is that, although the Government have told us that they would ring-fence the congestion charges for 10 years, paragraphs 16 and 17 contain a loophole. I call it Her Majesty's Treasury's loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Once the scheme is in place, an existing mayor or a new mayor who wanted to change it could be prevented from doing so, because the Secretary of State, by regulations that we have not yet seen and will allow to be made later, could define that changed scheme as a new scheme. London First picked that up in its briefing. It means that, once a scheme is in place, for 10 years the Secretary of State has the mayor of London by the short and curlies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that a parliamentary expression?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends where they are. The reality is that, once a scheme is in place, it cannot be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly having difficulty, so I shall attempt to be helpful. The Secretary of State's approval is essentially for the plan to spend the proposed revenues that will be raised. The Secretary of State does not approve, as I have had occasion to say, the details of the scheme. As I have also had occasion to say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey—this is the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton—if the Secretary of State decides that an incoming mayor's scheme is a new scheme, that new scheme takes precedence over the previous one and therefore would guarantee 10 years of ring-fenced, hypothecated funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes important points, but we think that they are wrong, first, because, although the wording in paragraph 17 is odd and the Secretary of State cannot impose a different scheme, if the Secretary of State does not like the way in which the moneys are to be allocated, does not think that what the mayor says provides value for money or has a problem with the financing of the scheme, he or she can reject it. The Secretary of State cannot interfere in the proposed scheme, but can interfere on the basis of judgment about value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why we think the Minister is wrong on her first point is that paragraph 16(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of any charging scheme which comes into force during the period of 10 years beginning with the inception of the Authority, the net proceeds of the scheme shall, during the scheme's initial period, be available only for application for relevant transport purposes".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1092</span>
Paragraph 16(7) defines initial period as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the period of 10 years beginning with the coming into force of the scheme; or"—</p></blockquote>
this is crucial—
	<br><blockquote><p>"such longer period as the Secretary of State may allow".</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State does not allow it, it will not happen.

The shadow Minister for London, the hon. Member for Croydon, South, has a list of amendments. We support him on amendments (a), (b) and (c). We oppose him on amendments (d) and (e). We support him on (f). We oppose him on amendment (dd), to which he did not refer. [HON. MEMBERS: "He did."] I beg his pardon. He did not refer to amendments (e) and (f), but he referred to amendment (dd). We certainly oppose him on amendments (g) and (h), which are clearly wrecking amendments that would apply the scheme only to a non-residential area. The southern part of his constituency, which leads down the Purley way and out of London, is non-residential. The amendment is therefore the Croydon, South amendment, which he wants to apply only to his corner of London. To apply the amendment only to non-residential areas—by and large, London is pretty residential—strikes us as off beam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support amendment (i) but we oppose amendment (aa), which proposes the interesting but zany idea that charges should not apply on days when there are disruptions or strikes. The unions could have no greater incentive to cause disruption than the knowledge that, on such days, road charges would not apply. Moreover, if road charging were not to apply in the event of industrial action, how could investors in London finance, who would be investing against the opposing revenue stream, make predictions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) will deal with issues concerning disabled people at a later point. [Hon. Members: "Oh no."] Oh yes. We support amendment (k), which would require money to be ring-fenced for the entire period, not merely for 10 years. Amendment (r), tabled by the Liberal Democrats, is in a similar vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South failed to mention that he supported the removal of paragraph 17, about which the Minister and I are having a difference of opinion. Liberal Democrats have tabled a flagging amendment that would require the mayor to consult the assembly. In the event of such power being granted, the Secretary of State should consult the mayor and the assembly. Logic would dictate that if one is to have a power, one must have a sanction, and the immobilising power contained in amendment (o) should therefore remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the provisions commits anyone to such a scheme. It would be unfair for Liberal Democrats or anyone else to be misrepresented as saying that, in supporting the new schedule and amendment No. 989, we intend to deliver the scheme at any price. That should be decided by London government, whoever runs it. We want to give London government that power, partly because the Government do not intend to allow it to set its own budget uncapped. Therefore, it must have access to other revenues. Londoners want investment, which they cannot obtain without the ability to raise money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not vie with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in respect of prolixity. The subject can engender such emotion that one runs the risk of speaking for a long time, but I shall instead make some extremely simple points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As amendment (b) makes clear, taxation of this sort should not be imposed without the specific agreement of the assembly. That is surely the purpose of any such democratic body. If Londoners are to have an effective say in the mayor's policy on such as crucial issue, their assembly men should have a specific power to vary the level of charges and to influence the policy of the mayoralty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment (a), which relates to the "keeping" or leaving of a car on the streets or roads, the notion that Londoners should be taxed for keeping their vehicle where they have no alternative place to put it, namely on the street in front of their home, is preposterous, regardless of the Bill's final terminology. They do not want to keep their vehicle there, where it is more likely to be vandalised and where, as I explained earlier, it will incur higher insurance costs. The Government's proposal to tax such people cannot be condemned strongly enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strike provision was derided by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions made his famous statement on the private-public partnership on 20 March 1998, when he said that he was"
	<br><blockquote><p>"writing to every member of staff in London Transport to explain our policy and the commitments we are given to reassure them."—	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 March 1998; Vol.308, c. 1540.]</p></blockquote>
So much for reassurance. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers is currently balloting its members of strike action, and the recent 48-hour dispute is still vivid in our memories. At the very least, the Government should concede that even if the Secretary of State writes to all members of the RMT, strikers still occur on the London underground system. It would be appropriate to remove road charging on the days on which strikes occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are a rat-runners' charter. Motorists in London will find circuitous and devious routes, when travelling to or from work, to minimise the charges that they will incur—they would be foolish not to do so. That will cause perverse distortions in traffic patterns, which will lead to disruptions in areas that were not disrupted before the charges were introduced. They will also distort
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1094</span>
London's economy. Marginal companies, which will have to pay for parking spaces for their workers, may decide that it is better to get out of London altogether than to face such charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is nearly touching on a matter that has not yet been sufficiently explored, although it was raised briefly earlier and it is well understood by my hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Croydon, South and by me. I refer to the effect at the boundary, where non-London meets London. The Government's regime will affect the cross-boundary flow of traffic in that region in ways that we do not clearly understand. What will its effect be on businesses that are close to either side of the boundary? Does my hon. Friend agree that considerable problems will be involved, and that they have not been explored properly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend graphically highlights a real difficulty, which was exemplified by a reference that the Minister for Transport in London made to Heathrow. Many of the workers who derive their livelihoods from Heathrow airport travel to work from the surrounding London boroughs and from outside London. It is wholly inappropriate to subject them to charging. Engineering and air traffic control personnel, for example, have to travel to the airport at unsocial hours. Why should they face charges when they get there? The charges will already be high enough for airline passengers and for those who work in the airport. We should consider other workers in this context, including those who work anti-social hours in the foreign exchanges in the City, medical personnel, the police, district nurses, social workers and other such categories, to which I referred this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The entire undertaking is characterised by two elements. The first is a power for the Secretary of State to interfere, intervene, second-guess and control a policy that should in a democratic, autonomous organisation belong to the mayoralty, even to the extent of stipulating the equipment that the authority may install. The second is a propensity to interfere, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South made plain, in matters that should be the jurisdiction of individual borough councils, which best understand local circumstances and can lay down appropriate charges for their areas, if such charges are necessary, that consider the interests of their residents and not the preconceptions or policies of the mayoralty, which is, by its very nature, remote from borough issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter goes to the heart of the legislation, and is the essence of the Government's failure to provide better government for London as a whole. The electorate was told that the authority for London would transform the environment and, above all, transport for London. The electorate was not told that the authority would lead to greatly increased taxation for motorists and distortion of the economy of London or that its elected representatives would have minimal direct influence in the assembly on the policy of the mayoralty. It is a recipe for conflict between the mayoralty and the Secretary of State, between the mayoralty and the boroughs and for frustration on the part of Londoners. They will resent the charges, and will

not forget who introduced them. Nor will they forget the supine silence of Labour Members, who purport to represent their constituents in London, on a matter of the greatest importance. We welcome Labour Members' opinions; we know that many have considerable experience that they could bring to bear on the debate. Sadly, they have preferred to remain mute. London will be the worse governed for it, and motorists will pay for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of the new schedule and the provisions in the Bill, and find the inconsistency of the Conservative party quite staggering. On the one hand, it says that it would like the assembly to have the powers to decide such matters, presumably after an election to decide whether to put the policies to the people of London. On the other hand, it says, like the hon. Member for Croydon, South said earlier, that it would like a mayor with a light touch, but subsequently say that it opposes those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of providing the assembly with the power to implement road charging. This Parliament will not implement road charges; as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said earlier, it, rightly, gives the democratic government of London the power to introduce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the schedule for hypothecation are innovative and important in our democracy. During next year's election, presumably the mayor and the assembly will campaign on that policy. It seems that Conservative candidates for the assembly will oppose it. Presumably the debate will continue from when the Bill is enacted through to the election next May. That is right, as the issues that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood mentioned will be before London.

A debate is rightly taking place on how we finance transport; the provisions are an important way of doing so. They will add a new dynamic to the way in which Londoners view public transport and their cars; it is a debate that will have important consequences. If the taxation raised through road-charging levies and parking provisions goes back into public transport and people see the resulting improvements, that will be an important factor in limiting car use. Our provisions are necessary.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mayor will be elected and he or she, and all the parties, will have a programme; as I said earlier, the assembly is important because it will approve the budget and is elected on a proportional basis. There will be a spread of opinion, even among members of the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had a chance to look back at the budget resolution procedure, on which we voted, while the hon. Gentleman has been speaking but if I recall accurately two-thirds of the assembly is needed to veto the budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To amend the budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister corrects me, helpfully. There is no way in which a party that is opposed to the proposals could get together a two-thirds majority to amend the budget. However, it could get 50 per cent, of the assembly to vote against congestion taxes. If only a straight majority were needed, the assembly would have much more power than it would under the two-thirds requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that but the mayor will, in the executive role, campaign on that issue. If the mayor is elected through a majority of Londoners' votes, he or she will have the authority to introduce policies. The assembly—as we have said several times—will have the important powers of scrutiny and of the two-thirds majority, which will act as checks and balances on the whole structure. That is the basis of the Government's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned proportional representation and the election of 11 assembly men on a list system. Those individuals will not have the close territorial connection of the other 14 members and it is a fundamental defect of the assembly's composition that local interests, which are crucial, will not, by virtue of the weighting of membership within the assembly, have the representation necessary to ensure that the wishes of people from particular localities are translated into charging patterns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are having the debate that we had in regard to earlier clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But this is more important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is an important part of the Bill and it is therefore important that we have the debate, but I still believe that having local representatives and the top-up of the 11 members is the right balance for London because it offers proportionality through the electoral system. It is a safeguard for the people of London. It also ensures that the opinions of all parties will be expressed when important issues are considered. The assembly will have the power to amend the first budget with a 50 per cent, majority, which is important.

Finally, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the capital structures that may be required, which is an important aspect of capital is investment in the facilities. There are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1097</span>
technological advances in the Bill, and I am sure that the mayor and the assembly will have the opportunity to take advantage of them, notwithstanding the fact that in certain areas capital charges may initially be high. In the long term, there will be a good amount of revenue with a small investment in new technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1098</span>
I support these important provisions, and I believe that when the wider debate takes place next year Londoners will support the proposals, which will be seen in the election of a Labour mayor and many Labour members of the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
