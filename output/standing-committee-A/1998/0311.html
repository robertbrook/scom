I have an instinctive sense that there will be orderly, constructive debate this afternoon, and that we will make good progress during this sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we begin, I should tell the Committee that new clauses 78 and 77 have been printed in the wrong place on the amendment paper. That is the fault not of the Government, nor of the Opposition, but of the Clerks. However, the Clerks do a wonderful job, so I will have no fault found with them. The Committee will find those new clauses on page 1290, and we will of course deal with them as shown on the selection list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my experience, the Clerks have been especially helpful in this Committee. It is a rare and unexpected mistake that they have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to nomination to the London development agency, which we judge should be made by not only the mayor but the assembly. I know that the Minister for London and Construction spent most of yesterday promoting a smoke-free capital on no-smoking day. As an expression of my opinion of the nanny state, I had my annual cigar yesterday in protest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor's influence over the development agency undoubtedly will in turn have an enormous influence over the London economy. As the Minister will know, we supported the Liberal Democrat proposal to include the assembly in the introduction of revenue streams, and this is the second area in which we believe that the assembly should be more closely involved than it will be in the matters covered by the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people, especially the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), who unfortunately is not in his place, have expressed the fear that there is a weak spot and the potential for corruption inside the development agency. I do not for a second suggest that there will be corruption, but if there is a weak spot, it lies in that area. The mayor should involve the assembly in making appointments to the board, because that would remove that weak spot and the accusation that one individual could make appointments to a board that will wield significant economic influence over the operations of the capital. That is the thrust of the many amendments that you, Mr. Winterton, have wisely grouped together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also believe that if a member of the agency is to be removed, it should be done by a two-thirds majority of the assembly. We do not want a situation in which a minority group could remove someone for political purposes—hence the provision in the amendment for a two-thirds majority. That is the other situation in which the assembly should be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A succinct start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse many of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), but I want to go into a little more detail. I welcome the London development agency, which the clause before us introduces into the Bill. I also welcome the fact that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>
agency—the regional development agency for London—will be more democratic than the agencies that the Government set up in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. It is clearly a step forward to make the new RDAs accountable—in this case, to the mayor, with assembly members on the board and consultation rights for the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would enshrine in the Bill the increased democratisation that the LDA will enjoy. They have been tabled in the spirit of working with the Government as they try to bring accountability to the RDA for London. They deal with a series of issues: the appointment of members and the chair, the processes for the removal of members, the delegation of the Secretary of State's functions to the mayor and the submission of strategies and annual reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that I am raising an old Liberal Democrat theme. The Conservatives are coming our way on the issue in one or two aspects, and we are pleased to see that. The Minister may say that the record is merely struck in a groove, but I hope that he will see the difference, on which the hon. Member for Croydon, South touched. The boundaries of our democratisation of the LDA should be extended because of its role at the heart of London's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To involve the assembly because of its role in the LDS's decision-making processes is in line with much Labour-party thinking. In debates before the election and in the run-up to the Regional Development Agencies Bill, many Labour Members argued for the regional chambers to have a significant role, and the assembly will effectively be the regional chamber for London. Many in the Labour party want elected members on such bodies to take a much stronger role than the Government propose in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must go back and ask why we are trying to democratise such bodies. We are doing so partly to ensure that economic strategy is not isolated from other aspects of public policy. Economic policy and economic development have a wide impact and affect housing, transport and many other areas of public policy. There is a need for public accountability in coordinating those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Democratisation is also necessary because the LDA will spend lots of public money, and there is a need for accountability. The mayor can carry out part of that function when he sets the budget and receives the audit of accounts from the LDA, but involving assembly members would be a much better way of enforcing accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third reason why we are seeking to democratise the RDA in London. It is the need to ensure that their decisions represent the wider community—in other words, a need for representation. People should have control over what happens in their communities, not just as taxpayers or consumers or employees, but as citizens. They would be able to play that role through their elected assembly member and in that way would be represented more effectively than just through the mayor. That is the general point of being able to democratise more fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
With regard to the amendments dealing with the appointment procedure, the need for assembly members to be involved in that procedure is even more significant. We need to ensure political balance for the assembly members who will be on the board. There must also be transparency in the appointment of the people with business experience. Under the Bill, the mayor will decide that certain people appear to have experience of running a business. The assembly members should be able to hold the mayor to account, to check that he has fulfilled that function properly—not just as consultees, but as part of the approval process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question for the Minister that relates to a debate held in the House on establishing the independence of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee. In that debate, we heard about how the members of the Monetary Policy Committee and the members of the court of the Bank of England would be appointed. We questioned the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury as to how he felt those appointments could be democratised. We argued—as did the Conservative Members in the Committee considering that legislation—that there was a case for confirmatory hearings, such as those held in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury answered those questions, and when he gave evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, he did not close his mind to the idea of such approval hearings. He said that the Government needed to review how such an appointment process could be applied government-wide, that it would be wrong to apply it to only one area of appointments; the whole machinery of government and the appointment processes of a wide number of bodies should be examined. Does the Minister know how that review is going? The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury made an explicit commitment to the House that the review would examine other aspects of government, yet a year later we have not heard from the Government, and we now need such an appointment process for the LDA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury made a fair point. If we are to set up that kind of system, we must ensure that we get the balance right. As we have seen in the United States, some public hearings can be intrusive. In the United States Congress, Congressmen and Senators can ask very private questions, intruding into the private lives of individuals who have been proposed by, for example, the President. We do not want to see that in the approval hearings on which assembly members would sit. We would prefer investigatory questions that focus on a candidate's ability to do the job for which they have been proposed. It is important to achieve a balance, because we do not want to enshrine an appointment process in which excellent candidates would be discouraged from coming forward, and discouraged from accepting the invitation of the mayor, in this case, to an appointment to such a board. Equally, we want a system that will ensure that poor candidates are rooted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scenario that the hon. Gentleman describes would surely lead to candidates being put off, because there would be a whole range of assembly members holding different views. A potential candidate would run a mile from such a situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1146</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reflects my point. Any approval process—hearings by the assembly, by a Select Committee, or elsewhere in Government—needs to ensure that a balance is struck in the way in which it is run. That is why I am sympathetic to what the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury told the House when we were considering a different piece of legislation. We need to think carefully about these issues. I wonder whether the Government have done so, because if we had been instructed by their findings, we could be putting forward a useful process. The process should ensure not only that excellent candidates are not discouraged, but that poor candidates are rooted out. A mayor could abuse the power of patronage, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South said. When we discussed the mayoral system on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Brent, East pointed out—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I remember that the hon. Gentleman was present on Second Reading. During the debate, he said that mayoral systems have been characterised by a degree of corruption. An individual can be got at, or got to, and it is possible that their powers could be misused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the hon. Member for Croydon, South said. We do not suggest that corruption will occur, but the potential exists, and checks should be put in place to guard against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to ensure that the Government achieve their objectives in ensuring that the people who are appointed to the board are the best people for the job. If the assembly were to be given a role in that process, it could assist the mayor, make the process more transparent and thereby strengthen the position and stature of the members of the agency. That would give the public confidence in the agency's workings and operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always good to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton, because we know that under your chairmanship the Committee's progress is always brisk and cordial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important. I was encouraged by the support of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) for my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South—although, sad to say, the longer he spoke the less disposed I was to back the Liberal Democrats' amendments. However, I shall not be churlish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not support the London development agency, because development agencies are not the best way to engender business growth and success. That arises from appropriate fiscal, monetary and other policies and, above all, from having a Government who fundamentally support enterprise. That is far from proven in present circumstances. However, as we are to have an agency, it is important for the confidence of our constituents that appointments to the board are as democratic as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South rightly emphasised the potential danger of corruption in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1147</span>
mayoral appointments to the board. I do not suppose that that would be the norm or even that it would be possible. However, we must guard against it, regardless. That is surely what the assembly is for—to scrutinise appointments and, we hope, approve them by its majority vote. There is always, given human nature, a risk of cronyism—a word that we did not know until the Government took office. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> It is now known by Members of Parliament and is also understood in the country at large. The development agency will have a significant budget, and the assembly will want to know that that budget is deployed for proper purposes—that it is used for the material improvement of business in London rather than the material improvement of favoured individuals who are close to the mayor. The same considerations apply in the removal of individuals.

We understand that the mayor will have overall responsibility for the strategic direction of policy in London. Under his guidance and tutelage, the development agency will have a specific responsibility for economic regeneration and improvements in the capital. However, there could conceivably be a conflict of priorities and policy between the development agency and the mayoralty. The assembly will want to know that if the mayor dismisses or seeks the removal of any individual, he is not being perverse in the exercise of his judgment. The proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, that the London assembly should approve the dismissal of any member by a two-thirds majority, is entirely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on this occasion, notwithstanding the longueur of the speech of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, the Opposition will stand as one in support of the democratic power of the assembly to oversee both the appointment and removal of development agency board members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome your encouragement at the start of our sitting, Mr. Winterton, for an orderly and constructive debate and good progress. I couple that with the hope that if we succeed in that, we do not face the same criticism from the Opposition that we faced last week over the orderly and constructive progress that we made; on that occasion, at your behest, Mr. Winterton, we progressed with our business very effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we reach the part of the Bill dealing with the London development agency, which is an important component of the overall package. It is about ensuring that London's competitiveness is enhanced and its economic development and regeneration agenda is at the core of the work of the mayor and the assembly. It is also about ensuring that our city has the means to sustain its economic success in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is well known, the proposals for the London development agency are closely modelled on those for the regional development agencies which have already been approved by Parliament for all regions of the country. However, there is one fundamental difference, which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton highlighted. London's development agency will be directly accountable to the mayor because there will be a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1148</span>
mayor here—outside London there will not be the same framework of direct accountability, so the regional development agencies will be answerable to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new arrangements have been welcomed by a wide range of groups. Business has welcomed them—London First in particular has shown considerable enthusiasm for the scope of the development agency to enhance the good work already being done to promote London. Local government representatives and the Association of London Government have also made it clear that they endorse the proposals. In its brief to Committee members, the ALG says that it is convinced that the LDA could offer—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to listen to the Minister's response to amendments that have been tabled by both Opposition parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the ALG welcomed the proposals for the London development agency as offering the
	<br><blockquote><p>"opportunity to fill a major strategic gap in the innovative and effective economic development work already going on in London—through the setting of regional priorities, effective partnership working and an avoidance of wasteful duplication."</p></blockquote>
Thus, the proposals have been widely welcomed, although that welcome obviously did not extend to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), who expressed opposition to the proposals and voiced his wish that the Government should support enterprise. Clearly, he cannot have been present in the Chamber on Tuesday when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear the Government's commitment to supporting enterprise in the widely welcomed Budget. We are committed to promoting and supporting enterprise nationally and in London under the GLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was able to ask about enterprise during trade and industry questions the other day, when a question was tabled about its encouragement. I asked the Minister whether he agreed that it was more important not to discourage enterprise than to encourage it. Slightly to my surprise, he answered that he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the subject of the discussion was. If it was suggested that measures before the House would have the impact to which the right hon. Gentleman referred—discouraging enterprise—it would have been perfectly proper to express that view. In some matters, however, effective intervention can make a real difference and help business to succeed, and the Government are responsible for dealing with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall finish my point and give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London development partnership, which already exists, and which is ably chaired by Sir Colin Marshall—or Lord Marshall—has identified key issues such as London's skills training requirement and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1149</span>
need to ensure that people have the skills necessary to meet Industry's requirements in the years ahead. It would be inappropriate for the Government not to engage in a rational process of identifying skills shortages and needs and putting in place a framework to tackle with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that one task of the London development agency will be to offset the depressive effect on real disposable incomes in the capital caused by the precept set by the GLA? That effect will relate to the road user charges that motorists will face and the parking charges that London's employers will have to bear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has obviously not spoken to representatives of business, who have made it abundantly clear that they welcome the proposals for the GLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
Stooges. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that the right hon. Gentleman describes as stooges representatives of the business world who say that they welcome the Government's actions in London. His remark shows the contempt in which he holds people in the business world who are working constructively with the Government in the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) made an important point, although perhaps he slightly exaggerated it. It would be a mistake for the Minister to think that business groups speak for the people of London. They speak only for a cross-section of them, and it does not necessarily follow that people on the housing estates of Greenwich and Croydon will agree with their views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not for a moment pretend that business speaks for all representatives of London. I was merely saying that business is well placed to express a view on the issues raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. People on council estates in every constituency in London will be conscious that the Government are restoring a framework of democratically accountable citywide government at an extremely cost-effective price. The average cost of 3p a week on band E council tax for the restoration of such government is very good value by any standard. I challenge the hon. Member for Croydon, South to go out and talk to electors about that, and to ask them whether they welcome the restoration of democratic citywide government, which was destroyed by the Conservative Government whom he supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us consider a specific example. The Minister said that the London development partnership, which is a shadow organisation, has identified skills shortages as a problem. Fine, that is a problem, but what do we need the LDA for? We know that skills shortages are a problem, and the bureaucracy that will surround the LDA is not necessary to tell us that. The Minister asked whether people wanted value for money. The answer is there without the cost, so why impose that cost when it is unnecessary to produce the answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reveals why he sits on the Opposition Benches and why his party is so
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
out of touch with the views of modern business. The business community does not want to engage in sterile party political disputes such as those that we hear from Opposition Members. It wants to engage in a constructive debate about how to meet our country's and, in the case of London, our capital city's, economic needs. It is engaged in the London development partnership under Lord Marshall's leadership because it wants to be engaged. It wants to help identify London's needs, and to work with the Government towards meeting them, and it is doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex matter. It is not a question of a glib reference to skills shortages, of course we know that an overall skills shortage exists, but how can details such as where the requirements will be or where skills shortages will pinch in the years ahead be identified without talking to people engaged in business who know where developments might take place? That is exactly what the development agency will be able to do, drawing on the expertise of the business community from all over London and helping to ensure a competitive city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman wants to have another bite. If someone were in a hole, I would not, on the whole, suggest that he continue to dig, but if the hon. Gentleman wants to do so, I happily give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister falls into the same trap as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst—that of exaggerating. No one suggests that the Conservative party does not want to engage with business. If the Minister looks out of the window, he will see a successful capital that was created by the previous Government, and which has little to do with this Government. Perhaps such points would be better made in the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training and enterprise councils and business men can identify the problems. The question that I shall ask in the clause stand part debate is whether we need a Londonwide organisation that dilutes, rather than enhances, the effort. That is the central point on which the Minister must persuade the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman doubts the need for such an organisation. If he were more engaged in dialogue with the business community in London, he would know that it favours and recognises the added value for London and the benefits of constructive engagement. That is what the Government are committed to doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say something quite nice to the hon. Gentleman. In his introductory speech, he took one tenth of the time to make the same points as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, with no less impact. He showed demonstrable economy in how he proceeded. Like the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, he was wrong, but at least he took a tenth of the time. Let me convince the Committee of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fundamental to the model of government that we are proposing that the mayor play an executive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
decision-taking role, and that the assembly provide scrutiny of the mayor's actions. The majority of the authority's functions will be exercised by the mayor—including all the functions to which the amendments relate—from consenting to the appointment and remuneration of staff or the acquisition of company shares to approving the LDA strategy. It is not appropriate that the assembly have or share those powers or duties. It is for the assembly to hold the mayor to account for the way in which they are exercised. That is the model for good, accountable administration. That principle runs through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Opposition parties referred to the potential for corruption, which exists in any form of government. The greatest safeguard against corruption is transparency and scrutiny. If the scrutiny function is confused or diluted, the likelihood of corruption is increased, not reduced. If, as the amendments propose, the assembly were party with the mayor to such decisions, it could no longer be as frank and free in its scrutiny function, because it would be implicated in some of the decisions that it is supposed to scrutinise. I am afraid that both opposition parties make the mistake of believing that giving more power to the assembly will enhance scrutiny when, in fact, it will make it more difficult for the assembly to carry out its scrutiny function. That is a fundamental mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that the Minister confuses our arguments and misunderstands our purpose. We believe that the assembly should scrutinise the mayor's proposed appointments to the board of the development agency and that, likewise, it should have what amounts to a casting vote on his proposals for the removal of individuals from the board of the agency. The suggestion is not that the assembly should be an equal partner in either process, but that it should have some say in whether what the mayor proposes is right and whether it should be commended and approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Several of the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South would substitute for the mayor, the mayor and the assembly. That would give the assembly a joint role with the mayor in the executive function. That would not give the assembly a scrutiny role; it would give it responsibility for the executive function. How can it properly scrutinise an executive function to which it is party? The problem with the Opposition's suggestion is that it would make it quite impossible for the GLA to operate in the transparent, accountable way that we believe is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am nearly persuaded by the Minister, but surely the mayor falls into the same category. If the mayor makes the appointments, how can he scrutinise the work of the London development agency? It cuts both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very nearly there. I hope that we can go the whole distance. The mayor is not meant to scrutinise the work of the LDA; the mayor is meant to work with the LDA, and the LDA is meant to implement the mayor's economic development and regeneration strategy. That is the relationship between them. In effect, they have an executive role. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
assembly's purpose is to scrutinise the mayor, because the mayor has executive responsibility—a responsibility shared by the LDA through the mayor. That is how scrutiny will operate. If scrutiny and responsibility are confused, the result will be a mess.—There will be no effective scrutiny and more risk of corruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands what is normally meant by executive power and scrutiny. In the United States, the executive—the President—makes proposals to Congress and Congress scrutinises them. Of course, in a vote, members will ratify the decisions of the mayor, but they scrutinise proposals. The executive function is in the proposing; the scrutinising is in the approving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a nice theoretical position, but it is not what the amendments say. The amendments would give an executive responsibility to the assembly as well as to the mayor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but they do. The Bill refers to powers being exercised by the mayor, but the effect of the amendments would be that responsibility for that executive action was shared with the assembly. The amendments give no indication of how the two are to work together. If there is a difference of opinion, how are they to decide whose will should prevail? What will be the framework for resolving disputes between them, if they have the shared executive responsibility that the hon. Gentleman is so keen to include in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I will take the Minister back—I am following what he says, but our views have not yet conincided—to our debate on the deputy mayor. We argued that the deputy mayor should be directly elected because, otherwise, there would be a conflict of interest between the deputy mayor's role in performing the mayor's executive functions and his role as a member of the scrutiny assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I can see, the Minister is arguing exactly the same point from the opposite direction. The irony is that he is now relying on there being a separation of functions, having ignored it earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman forgets that while we have made it clear that there should be links between the mayor and the assembly and that, in the interests of good government, the two should not be totally separated—something in which the deputy mayor will play a key role—we have also made it clear that no member of the assembly involved, in any capacity, in executive-making decisions can play any role in the scrutiny of those functions. That safeguard of separation is intrinsic to our proposals. I hope that I have convinced the hon. Gentleman although I fear that I have not convinced the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should remember that his proposed model of government for London is based on a constitutional doctrine different from what we are used to: the separation of powers. In that model, the assembly or legislature scrutinises through processes of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
approval, as amendment No. 72 makes clear. Under proposed new subsection (2), the mayor will propose, but the assembly will approve. Our amendment provides that that will happen through a simple majority. If the assembly votes down proposals for the board, the mayor has to return—just as the President of the United States has to go back to the Senate—with another proposal. That way of working is simple; the Minister is misleading the Committee by saying that the amendment is unclear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Gentleman who is confused. There are a raft of amendments, some of which might be confusing to casual readers. One Liberal Democrat amendment, for example, seeks to delete the requirement for the mayor to consult the assembly before reaching decisions —possibly creating the impression that Liberal Democrats oppose consultation with the assembly. The different structures proposed by the Liberal Democrats, with the mayor proposing but the assembly deciding, would mean that the assembly would take the executive decisions. It would not have a scrutinising role but would become the executive, thereby creating the confusion between the scrutiny and executive functions that we are keen to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments provide no clarification on how disputes would be resolved. Would the assembly be able to overrule the mayor, undermining his or her mandate, or would there have to be complete agreement between the parties before any decision could be taken? If the latter were the case, a deadlock could easily arise. In the Liberal Democrat paradise, that deadlock would probably be desirable, leading to continual debate and no action—but that is not our intention. We want a streamlined, effective system of government that will achieve results but ensure accountability, and that is what Londoners want too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, the mayor will have to consult widely on his or her appointments to the RDA board, which answers the fears about the mayor abusing his or her patronage. Consultation must include representatives of local employers, employees, boroughs and the assembly—we resist the Liberal Democrat amendment that would remove the obligation to consult the assembly—and will underpin the integrity of the appointment process. In making appointments, the mayor must have regard to the desirability of appointing someone who has experience of and shown a capacity for a matter relevant to the LDA's function, which ensures that appointments are made on the basis of merit—again, that is fundamental to our approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said repeatedly, we have put in place arrangements to ensure that the mayor is held to account for his or her actions. He or she will have to report all significant actions and decisions to the assembly, give reasons for them and respond to assembly questions. The mayor's activities will therefore be open and accountable. I hope that I have convinced the Committee that the amendments are undesirable—indeed, dangerous—and would not achieve their objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not reached his normally high standard of intellectual integrity in his reply to the arguments that were advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and by the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
Member for Kingston and Surbiton. He sought to suggest that the amendments to which we spoke would confer a joint power on the mayoralty and the assembly to appoint and to remove LDA members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 pm</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 72, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any appointments by the Mayor of London under subsection (2) shall be subject to the approval of the Assembly by a simple majority."</p></blockquote>
Surely that implies that the mayor will make the appointment, but that, for it to take effect, it must be approved by the majority of assembly men. There is nothing complicated about that; there is no question of joint decision making, or even joint promulgation of candidates. Far from it, the assembly will ultimately have the power of either approving or disapproving a proposal made by the mayoralty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1026, tabled by my hon. Friends, states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Mayor of London must obtain the approval of the London Assembly before making an appointment under subsection (2), and shall only remove a member from office under Schedule 2 with the approval of two-thirds of the London Assembly."</p></blockquote>
That amendment has exactly the same effect. Only amendment No. 1025 has the joint consequence that the Minister criticised so stringently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Liberal Democrats were suggesting by amendment No. 71, which would excise the phraseology about joint consultation from the clause, that the mayor need not consult before promulgating a candidate for the board of the LDA. That would be normal practice. A mayor who did not do that would be exceedingly foolish and would not carry the confidence of the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would quantify by the number of votes cast in favour and against a candidate for the board the confidence that the assembly reposed in that candidate. That is quite different from an amorphous consultation process that cannot be quantified. Consultation may mean looking in "Who's Who" or ringing up to ask for one or two references; it cannot be pinned down and codified in statute. What we propose can be codified. The Minister was disingenuous in his criticism; it has some validity in respect of amendment No. 1025, but not in respect of the other amendments.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may he helpful to the hon. Gentleman if I make it clear that my criticism was not confined to amendment No. 1025. if he looks at amendments Nos. 957 and 958—as he specifically referred to Liberal Democrat amendments, it is fair for me to refer to them; I can refer to Conservative amendments later if he likes—he will see that they refer to the creation of the London development agency's strategy: the economic development strategy. Those amendments would move responsibility for devising the strategy from the mayor to the mayor and the assembly. That is the effect not just of one amendment, but of the whole raft of amendments, in a variety of ways. As I have tried to suggest, that confuses the executive with the scrutiny functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In truth, both sides of the argument are valid. However, I am not persuaded by the Minister for a simple reason: our drafting may not be perfect, but we are proposing an anti-corruption measure, That is the overriding principle. Under the circumstances, I shall not withdraw the amendment, but seek to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall certainly support such a Division. The Minister has not made his point terribly well. Let us imagine how someone would be appointed under the Government's system. The mayor will talk to a few bodies in the amorphous way to which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood referred. He or she will have to meet the requirements in the clause in regard to assembly members and people who have experience of running businesses, but that is all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head and says, "No."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that there is the obligation to consult. Secondly, there is the obligation to which he referred to meet the criteria. Thirdly, a decision must be made public and reported to the assembly. The mayor is accountable to the assembly, which can question him on a decision. There is, therefore, a proper framework of accountability within which the assembly will perform the scrutiny function. That is inherent in our proposal, we oppose the hon. Gentleman's amendment because we want to avoid confusion between that scrutiny function and the executive function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for anticipating the point that I was going to make about where the assembly fitted into the process. Given the Minister's description of the process, hon. Members will have seen the flaw in it: members of the assembly will not have the power to overturn a decision. Accountability will consist of a few questions, a hearing, and a report, but nothing stronger. It beggars belief that the mayor could quite easily put forward a candidate who appeared to meet the requirements, and that the assembly could not act when questions and points of information and doubt were raised. The mayor could push his proposals forward despite debate in the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall take the hon. Gentleman back to the earlier parts of the Bill. I know that it is a long time since we considered them, but they contain clear provisions to ensure that there is a framework of accountability so that the mayor will have to go to the assembly to justify his or her actions. The assembly will then be able publicly to criticise the mayor. There will be enormous scope to highlight any potential problem or abuse. In addition to that power, the assembly will have crucial power over the budget. If it is not satisfied that the mayor has acted properly in relation to the development agency, it will, through its budgetary powers, be able to ensure that he or she does not have the finance necessary to carry through a strategy. Again, that provides a proper safeguard. I urge the hon. Gentleman to think about what the correct balance of powers should be in a separation of powers structure that is unlike other patterns of government in this country if we are to have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
really clear scrutiny and an effective safeguard against corruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes my argument for me. He says that the only way in which the assembly can prevent a name from going to the board is by voting down the budget. That is a nuclear option, which would bring the operation of the GLA and the bodies under it to a stop.

On my second point, to which the Minister did not reply when I raised it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there has been some correspondence with the Government about the possibility of the London development agency including somebody with experience of further and higher education; no doubt they will make their reaction clear. Preoccupation about the advance of London's economic position was echoed by the Minister in debate about the previous amendments, when he referred to need to provide skills. In that respect, there is no dissonance between the Opposition's view and that of the Government, although they may reveal a more technical position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment because of the exceptional importance of London in the provision of higher and further education. I should declare a constituency interest, as I suspect that my constituency has more higher education than any other. Higher education is a valuable resource to London, not least because of the people that it brings in. It is also valuable to the hinterland of London, and it is important that it should be mobilised and organised as effectively as possible. I had no hesitation, therefore, in tabling the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London has 38 higher education colleges, 60 further education colleges and a total of about 750,000 students in those two sectors. The research capability of its universities accounts for about one third of the research capacity of British higher education. All Londoners should feel proud of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly desirable that the London development agency should include somebody with a direct relationship with higher or further education. On behalf of the previous Administration, I say with pride that the tradition of higher and further education having an extensive relationship with its economic hinterland has been enhanced in the past 20 years, although it may have diminished after the war. That is an historical rather than a party-political point, and I hope that the legislation can capitalise on that thoroughly good development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) has tabled a similar amendment, to which I am sure that he will speak in a moment. While I have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
floor, I should allude to amendment No. 1054, which is a product of a briefing that we have all received from the Bandung institute. When the Bandung institute first wrote to us on behalf of ethnic communities in London, I said that I thought that the briefing was too generalised and that it should address specific issues that the Committee could deal with during the passage of the Bill. Accordingly, amendment No. 1054 is directed towards the specific issues of retraining and anti-poverty initiatives. It has been correctly grouped, Mr. Winterton, with my earlier amendment and with the amendment that was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet, because it covers similar ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I know what the Government's response to the amendment will be. If that turns out to be the case, I shall come back with a response to them, because it is possible that a mistake may be made while an opportunity to deal with the matter is available to us. Given London's strength in this area, I have no hesitation in tabling the amendment. I pay particular tribute to the provost of London Guildhall university in my constituency, who has played a notable part in pulling together the higher and further education elements in the capital to mobilise them for the common good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to speak to amendment No. 766.1 welcome and very much agree with the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was inspired by one of my regular discussions with the principal of Barnet college, Mr. John Skitt. It was also recommended by the Association of Colleges in the London region. To be absolutely open, I should declare an interest in that 35 years ago I was a lecturer at the Wigan and District mining and technical college. I like to think that I come from a teaching family. Your encyclopaedic and photographic memory, Mr. Winterton, will instantly recall that my late mother was a teacher and a head teacher in two village state primary schools in the heart of your constituency. Indeed, I was born in Macclesfield in your constituency, which I count as a great privilege—although Macclesfield has yet to return the compliment. Not only was my mother a teacher, but my brothers and sisters too. In my family, we take great exception to George Bernard Shaw's untrue, overworn and outdated adage. We believe that the correct version is, "Those who can go into teaching, and those who can't are sent into politics."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case for the inclusion of a representative from further education as a member of the London development agency. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster has reminded us, colleges, as well as universities, play a vital part in London's economic development and regeneration. They have a major role in enhancing the skills of our capital's workforce and a remit to widen the participation of London's residents in education and training so that they play a full part in the social and civic processes of the city. They also hold significant amounts of plant, which is located throughout London, and are employers of large numbers of people—lecturers and so on—with considerable skills. All the work of the FE
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1159</span>
colleges is done in co-operation with the higher education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 500,000 of the 750,000 students to whom my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred are studying or training in the further education sector, which is financed by the Further Education Funding Council. There is no question that the further and higher education sectors play a leading role in the London development partnership, which, as the Minister will know, is a legal entity but does not have a statutory power. In fact, those sectors are preparing a strategy in anticipation of the mayor and the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal of Barnet college, Mr. John Skirt, represents the Association of Colleges for Further and Higher Education, on the London development partnership. Many college representatives are also playing active parts in groups tackling skills development and business competitiveness, innovation and opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I willingly admit to the Minister that in one sense the amendment militates against a broader aim that I have tried to promote, not very successfully, in previous sittings—to keep the Bill as short and as simple as possible. I realise that clause 202 mirrors clause 2 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998, which provides that people representing local authorities, employers and employees should be on regional development agencies. I think that there is a lacuna there; representatives of further and higher education should also be included. The vital role that they play—as recognised in the joining of the former Departments of Education and Employment—suggests that we should write that into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be as helpful to the Minister as possible, I gently remind him that line 7 of clause 202 on page 105 refers to the "chairman"—that dreaded word—of the London development agency. I am happy to have this conversion from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words against the amendment. Anyone who has ever tried to make appointments to ghastly bodies such as the one that we are discussing will know that it is nightmarish enough to try to make the body representative—in some sense—as well as effective and small. The situation is simply made worse if people—however well-meaning—make pre-emptive moves to specify in the Bill that X, Y, Z or, indeed, anyone else should be represented. Once one goes down that road, there is almost no limit. That is why I regret to say that I cannot support the amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster, which my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a body has to exist and appointments must be made to it, whether by Ministers, mayors or anyone else, I am prepared to accept that we will have to exercise an element of trust in the sense of those making the appointments. They will know that they must work with the body, so it is in their interest to ensure that it has on it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
people of merit and ability who can work well together. Once we start that process, there is the temptation for all of us to promote our favourite interest groups, pressure groups, friends or croneys for inclusion in the Bill. We could then go home satisfied that we had secured exactly what we wanted. The danger is that the body would end up as either oversized and cumbersome or disunited and almost certainly ineffective. With great regret, therefore, I must urge the Committee not to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to come to the aid of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet from the attack of their right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intervening on the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton to say that if he imagines that what my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said was an attack, he has never seen my right hon. Friend attacking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a moment, I thought that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster would reject my aid. However, I take his point. I support his amendments, because education is key to the economic future of the capital and the country. It is important that representatives of higher and further education in London are part of the economic development board. The LDA's most important jobs will probably be education and tackling London's skill shortage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1009 would limit the mayor's patronage with regard to appointments to the LDA, but not in the way that amendments debated previously sought to do. There is no mention in the amendment of the assembly. Therefore, the Government cannot oppose it in the way that they did before, as there will be no confusion with the assembly's role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to include the wider business community in the appointment process. Right hon. and hon. Members may think this an odd approach; it is certainly not the most democratic one. We heard that argued in a previous debate. However, the business community ought to be closely involved in the appointment of business people, which is provided for in subsection (10). We propose that the representative organisations of London business that come within the London Business Board should put forward a short list of at least three people, from which the mayor should be required to choose at least one member. For members of the Committee who do not know its constituent parts, the London Business Board is a triumvirate of the London chamber of commerce, London First, and London's Confederation of British Industry. It is therefore extremely representative, and is probably the most pre-eminent body representing business in the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they want the LDA to be business led, and to have people with business experience appointed to it. We agree with them, and our amendment is in line with their objectives. We simply want to ensure that the mayor does not have the absolute
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
powers of patronage regarding every person who sits on the LDA board. We hope that the Government will see the strength of that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to agree with the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst about the amendments. I do not wish to repeat what he has said, but any mayor would take into account the education sector and the need to boost skills. However, that must be a decision for the mayor. If we were to accept these proposals, there would be a good argument for appointing to the LDA someone who represented the environment and other sectors. That would make the LDA unwieldy and it would not have the necessary drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be for the mayor, who has an executive role, to make such a decision. The Bill as drafted is right, and accepting the amendments would interfere with the balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I am glad that my amendments relate simply to the mechanics rather than the qualifications of the members of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled two very simple amendments. Amendment No. 1027 would ensure that the four politicians on the agency should remain elected representatives during their time at the agency. If they cease to be elected representatives, they should leave the agency then, and not stay on. As the Bill stands, they have to be elected representatives only on appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 202(9), the four members of the LDA appointed to represent particular London communities could all come from one group. I do not believe that that is the Government's intention. Amendment No. 1028 would ensure that two of the four should come from the London boroughs. Given that the clause provides a great deal of consultation with the boroughs, our proposal should not cause the Government too much difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contributions from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet underlined the importance of education, be it further or higher. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster paid due tribute not only to the number of such facilities within this great city but the international reputation that they have justifiably earned for the quality, quite apart from the quantity, of their teaching. The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend both underlined how important education is in developing and advancing skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the hon. Member for Croydon, South of the Opposition's concerns about skills shortages. Given the disproportionate percentage of unemployment in so many of London's ethnic minority communities, I thought that the remarks of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster about the fact that the needs of ethnic minorities should be considered were salient and relevant to the creation of a London development agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
I found it somewhat touching that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet was prepared to share with the Committee the fact that he is the black sheep of his family. He is presumably not allowed to go back to Macclesfield because he has opted for a profession that his family regards as being fit only for incompetents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was particularly concerned that the powers of patronage that he believed to be inherent in the position of mayor should be reduced. However, he seems to have no problem with according such patronage to the London Business Board, which, by virtue of its existence, would ensure that its choice was taken on board by the mayor. I found that bizarre. Certainly, businesses in London do not welcome the amendment. London First does not support the proposed amendment. Indeed, it believes that the mayor's obligation to consult the assembly is sufficient when appointing members of the LDA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is on slightly thin ice to cite the London First briefing note, because it states also that
	<br><blockquote><p>"London First remains disappointed that the skills agenda, so important to business competitiveness and economic development, was left out of the ambit of the RDAS"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that, but I cited London First in support of my perspective about the best way to ensure that the mayor has sufficient power to be sure that the widest possible selection of people is consulted before appointments are made to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion, I agree with the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill). The amendments are unnecessary. As the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet pointed out, the mayor is already obliged, under section 2 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1988, to consult a variety of people of specific descriptions. Section 2(3)(e) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other persons as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
The mayor will be able to consult anyone who is considered appropriate. I have little doubt that, in exercising that power, the mayor will wish to consult widely before. However, the specific requirement inherent in the amendments that requires a consultee representative of further and higher education leads us into the old list argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I was prepared, in another part of the Bill, to reconsider those whom the mayor would have a duty to consult, I am not prepared to have ever-growing lists in the Bill. The trouble with lists is that they are important only to the people not on them. We could find ourselves facing ever greater demands for ever greater fields of expertise or excellence to be consulted. The mayor might be so busy consulting that there would be no time to make appointments. We are following the regional development agency model, which was debated and agreed by Parliament. We perceived no special factors that would justify deviation from that model for London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have generally followed the pattern elsewhere on the composition of the LDA board, with the important proviso that we wish to leave the mayor with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
considerable freedom to make his or her decisions on appointments within some broad parameters. We are not willing to go down the road of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who is keen to reduce what he perceives as the power of patronage of the mayor, but who is equally keen to give that power of patronage to people who have not been elected democratically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments include provision for the London boroughs, the Corporation of London and the London Business Board to select some of the members of the LDA. It is fundamental to our approach to RDAs that their boards bring experience of various aspects of life to the table. Members are definitely not nominated by various specific interest groups. That would be a recipe for factional conflict and would undermine the acceptability of the agency to the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objection to amendment No. 1027 is that it would oblige the mayor to appoint an additional local authority member to the LDA board, whenever one of the original local authority members lost his or her elected office. People who have only recently left office on a London borough council, the common council of the City of London or the assembly will still be able to bring their valuable experience to the board's deliberations. Given that the requirements on the mayor to consult are more than adequately covered, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not deployed precisely the argument that I expected her to deploy, but I shall respond to her argument.

I was due to be the chairman of the Millennium Commission. I was told by the then Prime Minister that, apart from the three places that would be occupied by political parties—two members of the Government and one member of the Opposition—I had to find for the remaining six places representatives of all the countries of the United Kingdom, two people under 40 years of age, two women, someone who was involved in science, someone who understood big business and a sportsman. I added of my own volition someone who had a historical perspective, too. The three people appointed by political parties made some contribution to fulfilling those spaces, but I am proud that we achieved that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accused the Minister for Transport in London of skating on thin ice. I understood what she was quoting in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
the context of London First, but I drew attention to the skills agenda. I feel all the more emboldened for doing so because it was precisely the skills agenda and the skills shortage to which the Minister for London and Construction referred when accusing my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and the Conservative party of not understanding business men. The Minister said that business men were preoccupied with skills shortages, and wanted to do something about them. As he suggested, the skills shortage is a perfectly proper subject for the proposed body to consider. My amendments are designed to conduce and respond to that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the Minister for Transport in London was on slightly thin ice. Once upon a time, the late Paul Jennings, the distinguished journalist, who produced a weekly column for 	<i>The Observer,</i> read, in the new year, information that the publishers of his diary thought that he would need in the coming year. For that particular year, they selected the breaking point of ice. They informed him on the front page of the diary that half an inch of ice was necessary to sustain a duck, and that an inch was necessary to sustain an infant, and ascended through various calibrations until they reached 16 in for a county class locomotive and 24 in for a regiment of foot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he reached the regiment of foot, Mr. Jennings paused to wonder how the publishers knew. He produced the scenario of a dull moment during the Crimean war, when Lord Raglan was sitting with nothing to do, and an aide de camp—perhaps the same one who appeared in the film of the battle of the charge of the Light Brigade—rode up to him to say, "I'm afraid, Commander-in-Chief, that, as a result of our experiment, we have just lost another battalion of grenadiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Transport in London was on slightly thin ice. The fact that London First did not want the clause to be amended does not wholly convince me. In my constituency, and during a short period abroad, I ran a business for 18 years. I was profit accountable for every day of that 18 years, and met a payroll every month for that 18 years. However, it was only when I became Minister with responsibility for higher education—a position that I held for two and a half years under the previous Administration—that I realised how much I had missed by not being aware of the resources, facilities, skills and contribution of the further and higher education fabric in my constituency and, indeed, in society at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I thought that I had some idea of the arguments that the Minister for Transport in London would deploy. She generously attributed the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 to the previous Administration, and gave it the date of 1988. That is wholly and incidentally by the by. I draw her attention to the fact that on page 104, at line 26, reference to subsection (3) (d) of section 2 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 is removed from the brief of the London development agency. That subsection refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such persons as appear to him to represent the interests of those who live, work or carry on business in rural parts of the agency's area".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1165</span>
I understand why that was eliminated, because the number of rural areas in Greater London is obviously smaller than in other regions. However, the concept that people should represent particular interests in relation to development agencies comes through clearly from the Act that the present Administration passed, although the Government were generous enough to attribute it to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the matter to a Division; I said that I thought that I knew in advance the Government's position, and I shall in a moment beg to ask leave to withdraw my amendment. However, the Government have sent a message to the further and higher education sector that is, given the number of its students, unfortunate. I imagine that we have not heard the last of it and I regret that the Government have not been more imaginative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My mind was moving slowly when I gave the wrong date for the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998, but no one, in the wider context of those who are interested in our proceedings, would assume that the previous Administration had introduced such radical legislation.

I endorse the conviction and experience of the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet on the value of further and higher education, as do the Government, but my argument that their amendments are unnecessary had nothing to do with the representation of rural interests under the Regional Development Agencies Act for rural interests to be represented. The argument that I made in my opening remarks to the effect that consultation is required with
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other persons as he"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the RDA, but it also applies to the mayor— "considers appropriate", still stands. I apologise to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet for not thanking him again for his eagle—eyed scrutiny of the Bill and discovering another example of "man" being used instead of our preference for "person".

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1030, in page 105, line 9, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(12) Proposed members shall complete a declaration detailing their business interests, whether he has been made bankrupt, been a part to a voluntary arrangement, whether there are any judgements against him, whether he has been convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty or an offence under legislation (whether or not of

This declaration should be publicly available for one month before appointment and should be placed on the Greater London Authority Internet site.".</p></blockquote>
No revelation is forthcoming from the Government on the qualifications of proposed members of the LDA. The amendment would require simply that proposed members should complete a declaration detailing their business interests and stating whether they have been made bankrupt, been party to a voluntary agreement, had judgments made against them or been convicted of any offence involving fraud and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a range of scandals involving local government, particularly in Labour-controlled authorities such as Doncaster. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is a plain factual statement. [HON. MEMBERS: "Westminster"] The scandal of Westminster council took place in the previous decade and the Conservatives have since been re-elected three times, with increased majorities. I am talking about the 1990s, when there have been more than 200 examples of Labour-controlled authorities demonstrating unethical practice. We do not want that to happen with the assembly, as I am sure everyone would agree. It is a modest requirement that that information should be revealed before nominations are finally made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, we now know that the assembly will not have the power of approving or dismissing a members of the board, proposed by the mayor, of the Greater London authority. For the consultation process to make sense and for Londoners to have confidence in the individuals proposed by the mayor, the full facts about the background of each individual should be in the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No reasonable person could object to the declaration proposed by amendment No. 1030, especially on business interests. Any possibility of a conflict of interest between the responsibilities that appertain to membership of a board of the London regional development agency and its functions should be overtly, explicitly and clearly precluded, and the declaration should secure that objective. Londoners will not want members with shady backgrounds to have responsibility for public moneys and investment in the regeneration and improvement of industry and commerce in the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stipulations in the amendment cover bankruptcy, parties to voluntary arrangements, past judgments against an individual, past convictions involving fraud or dishonesty or an offence relating to company law, including insider dealing—no doubt the ears of the Committee will prick up at that requirement. They also cover offences relating to building societies, banking or other financial services, whether the proposed member has been disqualified as a director, or other material information. All such matters are germane to the responsibilities of a board member of the London development agency. I cannot see any rational or logical reason why the Government should not approve the amendment. It would show their good faith in the principle of there being an incorrupt and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
disinterested—in the best sense of that word—government of London and in the operation of the important functions of the London development agency. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee is aware, the appointment process consists of the mayor seeking the views of interested parties who might be appointed and then appointing the candidates of his or her choice. As part of the process, it would be right and proper for the mayor to ask questions regarding the matters that the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to, such as bankruptcy, fraud, dishonesty, offences under company law and disqualification as a director. I agree in essence with that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, there have recently been scandalous cases of, regrettably, Conservative Members of Parliament engaging in such activities. There have been examples of highly respectable businesses in the City being less than honest. It would be entirely appropriate, right and proper that such questions are asked before an appointment is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any fraud cases involving Conservative Members of Parliament, but two cases are currently going through the courts involving Labour Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case that triggered my memory is that relating to Mr. Jonathan Aitken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perjury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to know that Conservative Members regard perjury as a lesser offence than fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing that such questions are not responsible and should not be asked in the interests of probity and because public money is at stake, as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said. I cannot, however, see the virtue and advancement in such questions and their answers being placed in the public domain. That seems an entirely unnecessary part of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fundamental to the type of government being created that such key decisions be the responsibility of the mayor, who has those powers and responsibilities because he has been selected by the people of London. The proposal is much too detailed to be appropriate to the mayor's powers and functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a member of the LDA becomes bankrupt post appointment, that is a valid ground for removal from office. During the recent consideration of the Regional Development Agencies Bill, that was thought to be sufficient safeguard against members becoming financially unsuitable to continue in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be inappropriate to specify a particular form of publication. We live in an age in which the means and speed of communication change so quickly that to do so might be irrelevant. On those grounds, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to return to the matter, but the Minister's reply is far too permissive. I do not regard
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
it as nearly sufficiently rigorous. She said that she agreed in essence with the burden of the argument in the amendment. I wish that she had eschewed the party political point, which she could not resist, about Conservative Members; she demeaned her argument by deploying it. Allegations of—how shall I put it—less than efficient use of public money were made against the Welsh Development Agency, which was subject to quite severe criticism. Presumably, the moneys that the London development agency will be able to invest will be extremely substantial. Prima facie, I cannot understand why she should object to those stipulations being in the public domain. All Londoners will want to know that the mayor has done his job properly. She says that the mayor will question individual candidates, and I am sure that he will, but we want to know that that questioning meets all the criteria set out in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. They are all entirely reasonable, and I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not want candidates to be under personal financial pressure—perhaps subject to blackmail if they owe considerable sums. People who are subject to blackmail and feel that they have debts to honour may try to honour those debts in a less than appropriate manner, perhaps by putting investment in a particular direction as a quid pro quo. Any possibility that someone could be liable to such blackmail would be precluded by an avert espousal of the amendment and the declaration that it proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, but I do not think that the Minister came up to the standards that Londoners expect. The appointment process for development agency board members will be less effective as a consequence. I regret that that is how she wants things to be. We shall know who to blame if bad eggs get through the mayor's interrogation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the argument that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood advanced. I trust that I understand correctly that his anxiety relates to potentially criminal activities that would preclude someone's appointment to the board. I am sure that he—like everyone else—would not have a sweeping disregard for the issue of bankruptcy. Our commercial and business system is unlike the American one, where one is deemed not to be an expert in business until one has experienced bankruptcy, or at least a business collapse, two or three times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concentrating on the issues that the hon. member for Ruislip-Northwood justifiably raised on how one can ensure that criminal elements are precluded from the LDA. I repeat that my concern about the amendment is that it requires the publication of the names of people who fail the test, as it were. It is highly unlikely, given the wealth of information available to the mayor, that someone with even a hint of anything criminal or untoward in his or her past would be seriously considered for appointment. Supposing that such an eventuality arose, the mayor justifiably decided that such questions were a legitimate part of establishing whether an individual were bona fide and the individual admitted that he or she had been guilty of such offences, the mayor would not then appoint that individual. What would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1169</span>
the virtue of publishing a person's name and offences—which would presumably already be in the public record—and the fact that he or she had not been appointed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister poses a question, to which I shall try to respond. Would not the candidate have to sign the declaration? If matters later came out of the woodwork that contradicted the declaration, that would be perjury. That is much more of a deterrent than the fact that someone may or may not have, behind closed doors, answered questions that may or may not have been put and which cannot be verified in the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see how the requirement to publish names gives any greater protection. I repeat that I can understand the mayor being required to make inquiries, but not the replies having to be published. The hon. Gentleman gave an example of someone who is clearly not honest, but that dishonesty would occur equally if the amendment were accepted. The individual would go through the form and declare that he or she had never been found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or any of the other listed activities. If it were proven a few weeks later that that was not true, what advantage would the amendment give? I again ask that it be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who has made some important points. The Government are underestimating the potential for corruption. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister for London and Construction disagrees; we have a different perception and only time will tell who is right. However, time is short and I shall not press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet, who spent half-a lifetime as a planner; my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who spent half a career in civil aviation; my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who was with the Ford Motor Company; my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton I stand corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent half a lifetime in the shipping, oil and refining sectors. I am not sure where the Minister thinks he is coming from. He says that we are not engaged with business, but we are the party of business; that strand runs through the Conservative party. One could probably
	<span class='label label-info column'>1170</span>
write down the business experience and qualifications of the present Cabinet on a small piece of paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Croydon, South makes an interesting point and should ponder its implication. I do not think that people would dispute the fact that the Conservative party was seen in the past as being in close association with business. I do not for a moment dispute the business credentials of the hon. Gentleman or of his hon. Friends. I was simply saying that the stance that Conservative Members have taken in recent years—it may be that their shift to the ideological right or their length of service in this Building has distanced them from the reality of business—is such that they do not speak for modern business in Britain today. If they listen to the views of businesses at the cutting edge of new economic developments, which are the real wealth creators in Britain in 1999, they will find that they are engaged in a serious dialogue with the Government because they want their agenda taken forward and know that the Government are keen to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never heard so much tosh in all my life. Privatisation is one of the most successful business reforms of the past 20 years. Any business man to whom the Minister cares to speak will realise that the Conservative party transformed what were then known as the commanding heights of the British economy through its policy. How many privatisations are on the stocks at the moment? Not one. The Government know that the policy works and there is no question of them going back on any privatisations, but they cannot bring themselves to admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government talk about their dialogue with business and their understanding of it. I quite understand why various business groups want to be involved with the new LDA, in the same way that business wants to be involved with the TECS. Business men would not be human if they were asked to get involved and said, "No." There is more money and more power; there is something to get involved in. Businesses' reactions now are exactly the same as their reactions when the Conservative party came into office in 1979 and proposed the docklands development, to name just one initiative. Business will always say yes to such things. The Government's big mistake is to think that they have the whole business community sewn up because they propose something and business goes along with it. That is wrong, as the Minister will find out in his own good time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not for a moment dispute what the hon. Gentleman says; the Conservative party in 1979 may have been in close contact and accord with the business world. I ask the hon. Gentleman simply to reflect on one question. When the Conservative party went out of office in 1997, was it still in such close contact? It was people in the business world who said time and again to my hon. Friends and others, "That Government were tired, out of touch and excessively ideological. They no longer addressed the issues that mattered to Britain." Does not the hon. Gentleman recognise that that is one reason why his party is now in opposition rather than in government? It simply lost touch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1171</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be right about us being tired, but we did not lose touch or ideological contact with business. The truth is that any switched-on business man could see the writing on the wall from about 1995. Business men knew which side their bread was buttered on and which way they had to go to stay involved with Government. That is why they started talking to the Labour party; it was not because of any attraction to their policies. In all honesty, there is little difference between the Government's policies towards business and ours. It would he a mistake for the Government to think that they have moved the dialogue on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I will move the debate on. If there is one thing on which we agree with the Minister, it is the importance of improving the vitality of London. Let us take a look at London at present. It is a city with the highest gross domestic product per head in the United Kingdom. It accounts for 15 per cent, of the UK's GDP. It is home to more major international company headquarters than any other city in the world except Tokyo. It even has more US banks than New York. That is the number one location for inward investment in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That did not happen overnight; it happened during the past 20 years. The important point is that it happened without an LDA. The onus of proof lies with the Minister to demonstrate that an LDA will make things better. Docklands is one of the outstanding successes of the past 20 years. It was a success because it was narrowly focused. If the whole of London comes under one development agency, we will water down the agency's impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been to Croydon a couple of times now; he was very welcome and I hope that he comes again. He will be aware that there is a proposal to build by East Croydon station a substantial development comprising an arena the size of Wembley, a conference centre, hotels and so on. it will be situated by Croydon station, from which there is a train to Victoria every six minutes. I think that that is a good idea, the Labour council thinks that it is a good idea and I hope that even the Government think that it is a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An LDA considering London as a whole might say that that development would be better located in—say—Stratford, by the channel tunnel link. That would completely undermine the initiative being undertaken in Croydon. That is the danger of diluting the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the member for Cities of London and Westminster mentioned a question that he asked in the Chamber: whether it was more important to promote enterprise, or not to discourage it. That is a telling question, and the jury is out. The LDA may not discourage enterprise, but I am not sure that it will promote it any better than occurs at present. The onus of proof lies with the Government to demonstrate that the LDA can improve on the present situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the little spat that took place between my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and the Minister for London—in which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1172</span>
obviously fully support my hon. Friend—I wondered whether the argument could be settled by encouraging the Government to bring back the business vote; we would then see whether the political landscape changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to me as a planner. I should tell him that at one time I was an architect, a planner and a politician. I then occupied the three most unpopular professions in the country. It was always my ambition to take night classes in tax gathering or estate agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires the mayor to appoint four members of the London development agency who are elected members of the London assembly, a London borough council or the common council of the City of London. As the clause is drafted, the mayor could appoint four members of the common council of the City of London and no one representing a borough council or the London assembly—or four members of the London assembly and none from the other councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether in another place, if not on Report, the wording of the clause could be made a little more felicitous, to ensure that the objective—with which I entirely agree—is properly met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South is easily answered. Under his Government, the Welsh Development Agency did a tremendous job in Wales. It brought many jobs and much investment to Wales from other regions and from abroad. Many people in Wales owe their livelihoods to the success of that development agency. Other development agencies—in Scotland, for example—have also performed a tremendous task. I hope that the LDA can do that job for London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hope is not enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. No one can be 100 per cent, certain that the LDA will be successful. However, it holds out the potential of co-ordinating the mess that the hon. Gentleman's party bequeathed to London. The Conservatives took an almost chaotic approach to planning and strategic economic development in the capital, which we saw in Canary wharf and in many other areas of the city. The laissez—faire policies of the previous Government failed to ensure that many of the developments that took place in the capital were sustainable. Developments in the transport system were not linked with those in the wider economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South looks at me in a puzzled fashion. Nevertheless, his colleagues in the then Government were starting to realise the truth of what I have just said in the latter days of their Administration, and were beginning to row back. There is much evidence of that, for example in their establishment of the Government office for London and their attempts to develop co-ordinating committees. They realised that they had made a huge mess of London and that the Government had no strategic focus. If they had won the general election—which from 1995, and probably earlier than that, seemed a very unlikely prospect—I would not have been surprised if they had gone down a road similar
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1173</span>
to that proposed by the present Government. The LDA can serve a co-ordinating purpose, have a partnership function in bringing people together and play a leadership role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Member for Croydon, South said about hope. There are potential problems. The LDA is not a guaranteed success or a one-way bet. It must be resource focused, and try to bring early success to its proceedings so that it wins the faith of the business community. The business community will then rally behind it and, in so doing, ensure its later success. It must deal with the strategic challenges facing the capital—for example, the fact that we do not have an international conference centre that can compete with those in other major capital cities and large cities in western Europe. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said earlier that the capital is failing to attract that kind of business to the city. I hope that the LDA can rise to those serious challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are dangers in bodies such as the LDA. They can waste public money and duplicate functions that are carried out elsewhere by bodies such as the training and enterprise councils, chambers of commerce and business links. I hope that the Government are going to explain their views on avoiding that kind of duplication and waste. It is important that the private sector is committed to this development to ensure that that does not happen. I hope that the LDA's budget is not very large, because the private sector will then realise that this is a coordinated function in which it will have to provide much of the drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been worried by some of the reports by various bodies about the future of the LDA. They have been full of pleasing sounding, but jargonistic, words that do not deal with the day-to-day experiences of small and medium-sized companies in the capital. I hope that the Government are not looking to the LDA to be a sort of new research centre that is going to attract social scientists, geographers and the like to produce fantastic-looking reports. I do not mean to demean social scientists and geographers—I am an economist by training, but social science has a lot to offer. I hope that the LDA will try to focus on the nitty-gritty of getting the capital right rather than on the verbiage that is sometimes associated with such bodies. With that caveat, I wholeheartedly support—	<i>[Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Please may I have proper courtesy for the speaker who is addressing the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. As I said, with that caveat, I wholeheartedly support the Government's proposals for the LDA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer to the dockiands area in the light of the comments of the hon. Member for Croydon, South. That example highlights the need for the LDA. The Committee should consider the history of that development, which was heavily subsidised by capital allowances and into which money was poured. Any Labour Government proposal to use such allowances to create a development would have been called socialism gone mad. We have been accused of imposing stealth taxes, but they were stealth allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>
The development contained no infrastructure. In the Isle of Dogs it involved no proper public roadways and no planning. The areas immediately around the Isle of Dogs have suffered because of that approach. If the development had been better planned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would not have had it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we could have had it, and that it could have been much better and more planned. There is no denying that London has been a successful city, but it could have been a lot more successful. I admit that successes occurred, but alongside them were areas of deprivation, greater unemployment, wasted skills and other such failures. We should acknowledge the role of the LDA or of any body that can engage in strategic planning linking in the whole of London. I refer especially to the sub-regional partnerships that are developing, such as the Thames gateway and the Lea valley partnership, which are doing very good work and are beginning to work together. There is no reason why the LDA could not co-ordinate such organisations to ensure a much better strategy for London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's comments were unfair and his reference to the history of docklands was incorrect. If the area was as successful as he said, why did the Royal docks take such a long time to get off the ground? The London Docklands development corporation could have extended the scope of the development. The developments that took place in the corporation area were almost entirely office blocks. They took a long time to fill and companies developed them solely on the back of tax allowances. The heart of London, with that great area linked to the river, has had 30 years without any proper planning. I had some involvement in the early days, and I saw how the tax structure drove in finance very quickly and without planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has several times spoken of tax structures. I have quickly asked my hon. Friends, and as far as Opposition Members are aware the area was an enterprise zone, and no capital allowances or tax breaks were available for construction other than those that apply to any business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman should look at the legislation that set up the London Docklands development corporation. Many of the developments had 100 per cent, tax breaks. I am quite happy for the hon. Gentleman to go and look at that legislation now. The tax allowances given to business were innovative and much more extensive than any others. I am not a tax lawyer, but I experienced some of the effects of those allowances. Capital investment was very quickly made on the back of them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The corollary is that the hon. Gentleman is opposed to such allowances. Without them, the area would probably not have been constructed as it is today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darvill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not opposed to allowances, but I believe that they can be planned properly for the public benefit, rather than purely for that of companies that are seeking to make profit or to offset tax gains in the year in question.

managed in that way. The hon. Gentleman argued that the clause was not necessary, but in my view it is necessary because large parts of London still need that sort of strategic development and planning. If that is done in partnership with the business sector and the broader London government in which the mayor can play an important role through the London development agency, the whole of London will have a much brighter future. Areas of deprivation can be linked in and benefit from development. That would make for a much more successful London than we have at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but I want to pick up on the exchange between the Minister for London and Construction and my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a given that every multinational company in the world will always seek to be on good terms with and do business with the Government of the day. I do not think that any Administration of any colour should attribute to themselves particular skills in dealing with business because business behaves in that manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember chairing a meeting in Room 14 down the Corridor here. The late, great Sir Anthony Parsons, who had been our ambassador in Iran and was subsequently our ambassador to the United Nations, was addressing the United Nations Association in Westminster. He received a series of hostile questions from the audience about the iniquities of multinational corporations. To the astonishment of the audience, he said that as a diplomat who had spent his time living in third world territories, it was his view that multinational corporations were one of the profoundest sources of good in terms of economic development in those countries. He went on to make a series of arguments demonstrating why that was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those multinational corporations were of course working with the grain of the wood in terms of the Administrations with whom they were dealing. Whether a corporation is domestic or international, it will always seek—if it is sensibly led—to work with the Government of the day, but that does not mean that the Government of the day necessarily understand what the problems are. Before the Minister jumps up, of course I acknowledge that one can give cases histories illustrating a breakdown in communication between business and Governments of all colours at particular times over particular issues; I do not deny that. However, there is a danger of our debate becoming unduly partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak from my own experience, despite its limited worth. I had to meet a payroll for 18 years. Thereafter, I was in government for 15 of the 18 years when my party was in power. My experience was that when one was not actually a business man, although one understood what being a business man was like and what a disagreeable experience a recession was, it was nevertheless like living abroad—one knew perfectly well what living in this country was like, but one did not happen to be living here at the time. Every recesson is slightly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
On the other hand, those who have never run a business are at a disadvantage in that they have no experience of what it is like to be at the sharp end and to know that they must lay people off. I do not want to prolong this issue, but my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South is right to note that those who have had the experience of having to lay people off or to take risk investments to expand their businesses have been through that furnace and have a pretty good idea of what it is like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting stand part debate on the first clause dealing with the establishment of the London development agency. It is all about enhancing London's economic position, improving its competitiveness and ensuring that all of London benefits from the success which we hope to extend in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that London is a successful city in many respects, but I disagree that that is the product of the past 20 years. The City's great financial traditions go back centuries; they are not the creation of any one particular party and it is ridiculous to suggest that. In all humility, the hon. Gentleman might like to think about the damage that was done to manufacturing industry in this capital city during the recession of the early 1980s, which was clearly the responsibility of the previous Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take no lessons from the hon. Gentleman's party about a unique claim to speak for business interests in London. I accept entirely the achievements that were made during the 18 years that the Conservative party in government but, equally, the Conservatives should accept the mistakes that were made and the economic problems that were caused during that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster rightly highlighted, London is, paradoxically, a city of huge success and great prosperity, while also containing pockets of deprivation on a scale that is an affront in any civilised society. Thirteen of the most deprived 20 local authorities in the country are here in London. Unemployment in London is greater than in Scotland and Northern Ireland combined. That is the problem that we are wrestling with, and that we have a responsibility to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that social exclusion, which is, sadly, very much at the forefront of people's lives in many parts of our capital city, is addressed more effectively than it has been in the past. One of the London development agency's key responsibilities will be tackling problems of social exclusion in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister be more precise about what he means by social exclusion? Does he mean the alleviation of poverty, or some explicitly social function, such as ensuring that particular ethnic communities have an appropriate share of the financial investments made by the London development agency? What does he mean by this term? On the face of it, it seems to be a function way beyond the financial and economic remit of the London development agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1177</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that most people who look seriously at social exclusion recognise that it is the product of circumstances—often a combination of economic, social and other factors which create a position in which it is impossible for certain people to feel part of the main stream of the society in which they live. It may be because they do not have work, because they live in a particularly deprived community or on a stigmatised estate, because there is a high level of crime or vandalism in their area, because drug dealing is rife, or because they are subject to racist attacks or racial harassment on a scale which most of us would regard as utterly abominable if we experienced it first hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those problems exist in our city; they are an affront to our city, and we have a responsibility to tackle them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the Minister's belief that we have a common responsibility to tackle those problems—I refer particularly to drug dependency, crime, racial abuse and discrimination, and the other evils of society—but are they not matters of a political or social nature, rather than matters arising directly from industrial development and the creation of enterprise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks carefully at this, he will discover that the inter-relationship of many of the factors that I have described is what creates the real degree of social exclusion. People who are unemployed, who see no prospect of securing employment, who live in substandard accommodation and are prone to the kind of problems that I have described, are excluded from the main-stream of our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that wider social and political issues have to be addressed, but there are basic economic issues, such as job creation and training to give people the skills to be able to secure employment when it is created, are fundamental to attacking social exclusion. The Government are determined to approach this in a holistic way and not simply to say that it is a political or economic problem, or a problem that requires legislation. We believe that it will require action on economic, political and social fronts, to tackle crime and racism and to give hope to communities that have none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those problems are not exclusive to the poorer areas of our capital city. In some London boroughs, which would normally be thought of as rather affluent, I have seen poverty, deprivation and exclusion, which is deeply offensive and disturbing. One has only to see that to realise that we have a major task. The central area of London has the highest per capita income of any area in the European Union. The figures that were issued three weeks ago show that central London tops the European league in terms of GDP per capita yet, next door—a stone's throw away—we have horrendous deprivation, poverty and disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That implies—it would be of interest to know whether this is what the Minister means—a considerable degree of redistribution. He talks about deprivation and that thing called social exclusion, but he has not told us how the development agency might deal with the problem. He now says, with a sense of pride and achievement that I share, that central London has a high per capita income, and he seeks to tie the two facts
	<span class='label label-info column'>1178</span>
together. What mechanisms of redistribution does that imply, and what effect does the Minister think that will have on central London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the right hon.Gentleman raised that question. Because of where he is coming from, he immediately thinks in terms of redistribution. We think of it in terms of ensuring economic efficiency. We believe that London's economic advantage should be used as a basis for extending wealth in a way that will bring benefit to all of London, so that those problems can be tackled more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that there are many problems with the way in which those figures are calculated? I believe, for example, that they include the incomes of many people who do not live in the capital but who commute to the city centre. Will the Minister confirm also that those figures are doing down the case in Europe for special status for some parts of the capital? I hope that, as the Minister responsible for London, the hon. Gentleman is making sure that the case for the deprived people in London is being put forward and that those figures are not being used against us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as we become engaged in a debate of considerable significance about matters of real political, social and economic importance, we can be sure that the Liberal Democrats will start a nit-picking argument about the meaning of statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dispute the fact that there may be questions about the statistics, but the point of principle that I was making—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman should listen to the point that I was making. By any criteria, central London is a wealthy area, with many wealthy people living and working in it. Yet, very close to that area of London are pockets of deprivation that should cause shame in the third world, let alone here. That is the problem. We surely have a common interest in addressing it. That is what the Government are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London development agency will be the mayor's executive body. It will help to carry forward a strategy for improving London's competitiveness, increasing its attractiveness as a location for inward investment and ensuring that the social exclusion agenda is addressed in a rigorous fair-minded way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the point a little further. The Liberal Democrats entirely agree with the Minister that tackling poverty and its causes is entirely necessary. Does not the Minister agree that the Government and the GLA will be hampered in pursuing that agenda because the definition of the resources available in central London includes people who travel to London to work? That will cause problems, because London's case for resources from Europe will be weakened. Surely, that is a problem? It is not about statistics; it is about real figures having a real impact on people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably hopeless to expect the Liberal Democrats to raise their sights above arguments about statistics to the wider, broad picture that we are trying to paint. I have already made it quite clear to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1179</span>
hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that I do not defend every aspect of the statistical analysis on which the figures wore based. Nevertheless, central London houses many wealthy people alongside great poverty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Karen Buck (Regent's Park and Kensington, North)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether, in response to the criticisms of Liberal Democrat Members of the role of the development agency, my hon. Friend will reflect on the opportunities to be found in Paddington, on the edge of my constituency. A multibillion pound private-sector led scheme of commercial and high-value residential property is coming on stream in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development agency could help ensure that the extremely deprived surrounding communities in north Paddington receive their fair share of the additional jobs that would be generated by that scheme. It would be able to lever in regeneration and complementary funding for the benefit of the north Paddington community, and ensure that any section 106 development was used to good purpose. The LDA could also ensure that a fair proportion of affordable homes was included in that development. The development agency could secure regeneration without necessarily involving any element of redistribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a particularly important matter. She has worked exceptionally hard to ensure that her constituents in the Paddington area derive maximum benefit from the regeneration opportunities being created around the Paddington basin and other similar development opportunities in the area. Such action is in everyone's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with that objective in mind that we want the mayor and the London development agency to take over from central Government the responsibility for operating the single regeneration budget in London and for carrying out the regeneration activities that are presently the responsibility of the London region of English Partnerships. Within some broad parameters, the mayor and the LDA will be responsible for ensuring that those funds meet the priorities and needs of Londoners. The mayor will be answerable to Londoners for how he or she uses that opportunity to improve the lot of some of the most disadvantaged people in our city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that we would set some broad parameters for the spending of regeneration funds passed to the mayor and LDA. We shall be delegating a number of ministerial functions to the LDA, as we shall to the regional development agencies. Guidance is being prepared for the RDAs on how they should carry out those responsibilities. Similar conditions will be attached to the functions delegated to the LDA, but they will recognise its unique role as the executive arm of the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South questioned the need for a London development agency. He spoke about the importance of focused action in particular areas. I agree with him on that, but it does not take away the need for a wider strategic view of the needs of London as a whole. Those who are engaged in focused action locally and the business partnerships that exist in various parts of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1180</span>
London are themselves at the forefront of the argument that the LDA should have that wider co-ordinating role. The two are not at all incompatible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister square that argument with the point that I was making about a project—I gave the example of one in Croydon—that may not be consistent with the LDA's aims and ambitions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely to avoid the problem of separate parts of London competing unproductively against each other that the LDA has that wider co-ordinating role. For instance, if Croydon and Enfield were both seeking to win inward investment from an overseas business that was thinking of coming to London, the last thing that one would want would be for both areas to engage in an unproductive dispute and lavish resources on attracting that firm to the area. We want a mechanism whereby the two could reach agreement on the preferred location in London. That must be sensible. Conversely, we do not want conflicts in London between different areas trying to attract investment from other parts of London. That is a waste of money and it saps the ability of people in business to relate properly to a government body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. member for Croydon, South would like a framework that allowed individual initiatives in different areas. That lack of co-ordination—that lack of strategic thinking—was the real Achilles, heel of the Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman talked about docklands. If the Conservative Government had been serious about the regeneration of docklands, they would not have left the building of the Jubilee line to their last years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of infrastructure and proper planning meant that the docklands initiative was nearly scuppered in the early 1990s. I give full credit to those responsible for that initiative; it helped transform that area of London. It went through an extremely rocky patch. At the time, however, the lack of necessary infrastructure investment meant that business had insufficient confidence to move into docklands. Things have now changed. The Jubilee line is well on the way and we hope that it will be completed soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that the hon. Gentleman started it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows me well enough to know that I give credit where credit is due, but I do not let parties off the hook by pretending that they have achieved miracles when their record is patchy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is aware that when we established docklands, the borough of Greenwich did not want to be included in the scheme. The docklands area was developed but, for more than 10 years, absolutely nothing happened until the Government decided to put the dome on the Greenwich peninsula. That is an illustration of the Labour party being left to its own devices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1181</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman could not resist the temptation to sink into party political sloganising. Greenwich, probably more than any other area in the country, suffered the devastation of the recession of the early 1980s. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That was the responsibility of the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The riverside industry provided livelihoods for many people in my constituency. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> But those jobs were wiped out thanks to the economic incompetence of the Conservative party. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> To have the nerve to talk about the sufferings of the people of Greenwich shows how out of touch the hon. Gentleman is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Can I cool things down a little, and also urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South not to intervene constantly from a sedentary position? If he wants to intervene, will he please rise to his feet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move now to the specific arrangements about the appointment by the mayor of members to the London development agency. We want a framework that will ensure that the LDA, like regional development agencies, is business led. We do not want to be too prescriptive. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was correct when he spoke to the amendments, but we want broad parameters to ensure that the body is business-led, and that certain other interests are represented on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be local authority representatives, and we have provided for at least four members to be appointed to the board from possible local government bodies. We have included the assembly, the London boroughs and the court of common council of the City of London. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked the fair question whether that could result in all four members being drawn from the court of common council. In theory it could, but I cannot imagine the mayor making such appointments. We are giving the mayor discretion: it is for him to decide, just as, with the RDAS, it is for the Secretary of State to decide. We have tried not to be too prescriptive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Minister is being fair in his reply. However, it could be improved if he kept the requirement for four members to come from three categories—one from the assembly, and not less than two from the boroughs and the court of common council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has reinforced my case. If we made such a requirement, we woould immediately impose restrictions that might make it difficult to achieve a desirable objective. It is perfectly possible that the mayor will conclude that no members of the assembly should sit on the London development agency. That would be impossible if legislation were to specify that at least one shall come from each specified body. The mayor might decide that it is right that all representatives should come from the London boroughs and the common council of the City of London, which is a perfectly tenable view. Conversely, the mayor might decide that all four should come from the assembly. The mayor should have such discretion in making that decision, for which he will be accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
We have suggested that other interests, as well as business and local government, be taken into account in making appointments to the regional development agencies. In London, where the London development partnership is already paving the way in an exciting way for the work of the London development agency, higher education is represented, as many Opposition Members know. Roderick Floud, of Guildhall university, is a member of the development partnership, and we very much welcome the input of the higher education sector. We are not saying that that will not be carried forward into the London development agency. We simply do not want to be unduly prescriptive, for the reasons that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least half the board, including the chairman, must be people who appear to the mayor to have experience of running a business. That is crucial. However, the mayor will judge who they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To respond to the points made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, I did not claim a special entitlement to speak for or represent business. Rather, I said that the Conservative party, which used to claim that it represented business, was in the curious position of being increasingly out of touch with the views, aspirations and expectations of the business community. I fear that Conservative Members are digging themselves into a deeper hole by opposing the London development agency, which has the support of very many voices in the business community in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not claim a special understanding of what it is like to run a business through a recession, although I have done so—through the previous recession in the early 1990s, in which my small business had difficulty in surviving. I was aware of the problems. I make no claim to be able to speak especially for business because of that, but I resent the implication that Labour Members have no experience of business, because that is not the case. All I know from my meetings with business in the past year and three quarters since I have been Minister for Construction as well as for London is that the business world appreciates Ministers who listen, consider its interests, are straight with it and are willing to engage in a positive dialogue about tackling the issues that really matter. That is what the Government are doing; it is why we are introducing the Bill, and it is what the London development agency will help us to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments should be a bit more straightforward than some of the other matters that we have been discussing. Their primary purpose is to ensure greater involvement on the part of the London boroughs and the City of London. The Bill effectively gives the mayor the power to direct the development agency. That power is granted at the expense of some of the other elected and legitimate business interests in London. Greater consultation with the boroughs in drawing up the strategies would be for the good of London and would do much to improve the rapport with the boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy should take full account of the various differing economic interests of the London boroughs and the City of London. The Minister will be aware that the Bank of England has been studying the small business sector. As was said earlier, London has many big businesses, but it also has a plethora of small businesses, down to the level of sandwich bars and print shops. Many in the ethnic community are involved in small

businesses. There should be much greater consultation with and recognition of the small business sector in drawing up the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the majority of the boroughs Are against the strategy, they should be able to oblige the mayor to revise it until at least a majority of them agree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make a brief speech merely to say that, like my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, I would hope that after the somewhat torrid exchanges that characterised our debates before the tea break, we are now addressing matters that any objective, fair-minded person would regard as uncontentious. There is nothing ideologically divisive in the amendments. I would have thought that it would be common courtesy, let alone eminent good sense, for the development agency's strategy to be presented to the assembly, the boroughs and the common council of the City of London for their consideration, and for the respective economic interests of all those bodies to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a risk that the mayor may have his own hobby horses or pet projects, which may militate against the interests of individual boroughs, the City or a particular part of the capital. The amendments would diminish that risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final amendment, No. 1035, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The London Development Agency Strategy shall be returned to the Mayor and Assembly for modification should it be rejected by a majority of the London Boroughs".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would provide a veto and safeguard for the boroughs. My party has consistently emphasised that one of the Bill's great deficiencies throughout has been the fact that the interests of individual boroughs have been subordinated too much to the interests of the authority and the mayoralty. The amendment would redress that imbalance by giving the boroughs the power to achieve a modification of the strategy if the majority of them felt that it was not in accordance with their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would do well to take heed of the amendments; they would do even better if they gracefully accepted them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to disappoint the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I hope, however, that I will convince him gracefully and graciously that the amendments are inappropriate and that the hon. Member for Croydon, South should not press them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also echo the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that the brief remission that we had from our debate to have a cup of tea has had a calming influence on proceedings. It certainly enabled me to have a brief discussion about competitiveness, which is at the heart of the issues before us. I was reminded of a discussion that I had with someone who took a rather limited view of competitiveness. Rather than seeing matters in terms of how to advance his firm's standing and attraction to customers, he saw them simply in terms of making sure that customers recognised his firm easily. The recipe for competitiveness that that individual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1185</span>
suggested was simply to change his company's name to AA Aardvark so that it would go to the top of the list of names in the 	<i>Yellow Pages</i> and thereby ensure a more competitive position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to consultation with the boroughs, which is absolutely appropriate. We want to ensure that there is consultation. Any sensible mayor will engage in dialogue with the boroughs, not just on economic development but across the range of responsibilities. There is no obstacle to that in the Bill. Dialogue should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not, however, want to confuse the mayor's role and that of the boroughs. The strategy is the mayor's, not the boroughs'; they will have their own, separate economic development strategies. I think that they would resent the idea of the mayor having a right of veto over their strategies. Equally, it would be inappropriate for them to have a right of veto over the mayor's strategy. There should be consultation and discussion, but the ownership of the strategy must be the mayor's. For that reason, the Bill should remain unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue that I want to raise is that the amendments would provide no mechanism by which the assembly and the mayor could jointly agree on any revisions to be made, if the London boroughs and the common council rejected a draft strategy. Nor do they specify what revisions would be required. There is no provision for the revised strategy to meet with the boroughs' and the City's approval. The amendments would raise more questions than could be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By giving the assembly the role that is contemplated in amendments Nos. 1031 and 1035, we would—as I said about an earlier group of amendments—undermine the separation of powers upon which the GLA's whole structure is based. If the assembly took part in a joint exercise of executive functions, it would be seriously compromised in trying to play its scrutiny role property. I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not really answered my key point. He rightly said that each borough will have its own economic strategy. He does not think that the mayor should have a veto over it or that the boroughs should have a veto over the mayor's strategy. In the light of our earlier exchanges, it is clear that the Opposition's main concern is that the LDA will have a veto over the boroughs' strategies. The problem is that what a borough thinks is important may not be recognised as such by the mayor or the LDA. We have debated this theme several times over the last couple of months and I see no point in progressing any further with it. I am satisfied that we have highlighted it in this area as much as in any other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is moving towards begging the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment, I should like to intervene. We have been talking of individual boroughs and their economic regeneration plans. A series of partnerships have arisen organically as a result of co-operation of a geographical nature—for example, the central London and cross-river partnerships and the co-operation between the TECs. The Minister's reply did not clarify how any disagreement between the LDA and the central London
	<span class='label label-info column'>1186</span>
partnership, the cross-river partnership or the Pool of London operation would be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes my point very well. There is no resolution procedure in such circumstances, and that highlights our concern about the entire group of clauses. It relates to what I said on Tuesday about Conservative Members' vision of a mayor with a lighter touch—a mayor, with an assembly made up of borough leaders, who would draw on the partnerships that are in place. That view obviously does not command majority support in the Committee, but it is the context in which our amendments were set. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1037, in page 106, line 25, after "to" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall report to the Mayor and Assembly upon their adherence to".</p></blockquote>
Clause 204 requires various bodies to have regard to the LDA strategy. We are worried about the phrase "have regard to". It is obviously important that there should be proper lines of accountability and reporting, but the phrase "have regard to" could mean merely having read and noted. The amendment would ensure that those bodies would
	<br><blockquote><p>"report to the Mayor and Assembly upon their adherence to"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, their compliance with-the strategy. The activities of, for example, Transport for London, which is one of those bodies, are inseparable from London's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is certainly a need for co-operation between the LDA and the Metropolitan police. A wide range of research shows that crime is often linked to business failure. Professor Sue Birley demonstrated that in a sample of some 480 businesses, crime was central to the collapse of 38 of them and a factor in the failure of a further 37. Effective policing strategies in New York and other American cities that have seen significant falls in crime rates have been central to the re-establishment of business confidence among small business owners and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendment because it would be far more helpful if bodies such as TfL and the Met were to say what they were doing to comply with the strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example that the hon. Member for Croydon, South gave as one of his reasons for tabling the amendment highlights what is central to the mayoral strategy, whether that is defined with regard to particular functions or as the overarching way of creating in its simplest form a better London for Londoners. The hon. Gentleman touched directly on the necessity for functional bodies to be aware of how their activities can impact, improve or perhaps have a deterrent effect. That is where the mayoral strategy is so vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a variety of reasons, it took us quite some time to decide which clause we were going to debate. However, I regret to tell the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary. He will remember that clause 51, to which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1187</span>
the Committee has already agreed, empowers the assembly to require the attendance at its proceedings of staff or members of the functional bodies. The London development agency, the Metropolitan police authority, London fire and emergency planning authority and Transport for London are indeed functional bodies. They are further required to provide the mayor with any information requested. The assembly can also require the provision of documents. Thus, the extent to which the functional bodies have regard to the LDA strategy can be easily established by the mayor and the assembly. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister would clarify one point. Having had a quick look at clause 51, I see that it is relevant to witnesses before the assembly. In this instance, we are talking about the interaction between the functional bodies and the LDA. I am pushing for a report to go to the LDA, rather than the bodies going to the assembly. Does the Minister not think that I have a point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there is also the requirement under new section 7A to the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 in clause 204 for the aforementioned functional bodies to "have regard to" the LDA strategy in exercising their functions. Thus there is a double grip, so to speak, to ensure the kind of cooperation and awareness that we agree with the hon. Gentleman is vital to delivering the mayoral strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a big deal. If the Minister is satisfied that the grip is there, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always seek to be helpful to the Committee. As there has been some confusion about the initial selection list, which was replaced by an accurate version, I should tell the Committee that we may debate amendment No. 1045, followed by amendment No. 1038—which was the subject of confusion a moment ago. The final debate before clause stand part will be on amendment No. 1051. I may decide that a clause stand part debate is necessary, but I shall naturally respond to the Committee's wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1051, in page 106, line 40, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) relevant business bodies including the London Tourist Board.".</p></blockquote>
The London tourist board was one of the organisations that contacted all members of the Committee when they were appointed as such, stating that it would like to brief us and discuss aspects of the Bill about which it was uneasy. Its chief executive happened to be ill on the day on which he was due to have that conversation with me.I suggested that, rather than giving a general briefing, it might be more sensible to specify aspects of the Bill about which the board is uneasy and to suggest amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London tourist board produced the amendment in respone to my correspondence, and it is perhaps neither as elegant, nor as relevant as some other Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>1188</span>
amendments. None the less, it would not be right to deny the London tourist board its day in court, which has come quite late in the Bill's passage. It has told me that it has been engaged for many years in producing a strategy. It is worth obtaining a brief response from the Minister about the Government's attitude to how the London tourist strategy fits in with their general thinking in the Bill, not least because of tourism's massive contribution to economic development in the capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on the elegance or relevance of the amendment. It is, however, unnecessary. The right hon. Gentleman will recall a discussion about whom the mayor will consult. The clause will introduce into the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 subsection (8)(b) of new section 7A. That subsection places an obligation on the mayor to consult on the draft strategy with representatives of employers in the agency's area. Under current plans, the London tourist board will receive part of its funding through the GLA, so they will have a very close working relationship. In the light of those two definite underlinings of the importance to London and the mayoral strategy of tourism and the London tourist board, I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Front Bench Opposition Members are as concerned about tourism as my right hon. Friend.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never understood in the phrase box and cox which of us is box and which of us is cox. My hon.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long. The Government should consider whether clause 204 would be improved by the introduction of a provision that the London development agency should publish a notice of the criteria to be used for the granting of financial support to other institutions or individuals. It is necessary that the criteria by which investments are made with public money on behalf of Londoners be clearly in the public domain. There has to be genuine transparency—the people of London need to know that the investments have been made on a sound economic and industrially appropriate basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about a holistic approach, social exclusion and the necessity for the London development agency to consider wider issues beyond what one might regard as its normal economic remit, for example, drug dependency, housing, crime, anti-social behaviour and much else besides. However, there is a risk that unless the criteria are explicitly, overtly and publicly of a kind that maximise the return on public investment, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1189</span>
London development agency could be utilised for purposes that are not, in the first instance—although I recognise that it could consequentially have benefits—for the improvement of London's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the great disparity of wealth in our capital. We are all deeply conscious of that; the contrasts between different parts of London are immense. Poverty sits ill alongside excessive and embarrassingly high per capita incomes. Nevertheless, if the criteria are published for all to see, the performance of the London development agency can be better assessed against those criteria. I am sure that as a consequence, Londoners would get better value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister, in looking at clause 204 as a whole, will be able to assure me that he will come back on Report to ensure that those critieria are publicised and that, as a consequence, the London development agency's strategy is formulated in a way which secures best value for money and, above all, maximum return for the investment of public resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are issues such as that introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood which are worth ventilating on clause stand part because we have not yet had the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in my hand the Association of London Government briefing, and will take the liberty of quoting a couple of paragraphs from it. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ALG believes that it is important that the LDA reflect the wider political objectives of Government"—</p></blockquote>
I have no complaint about that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"rather than focusing solely on business competitiveness—and an integrated approach to regeneration has clearly been promoted by Government."</p></blockquote>
Again, it is not for me to disagree with that. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purposes of the LDA include the promotion of employment—a key concern in tackling social exclusion; and the promotion of sustainable development. The three key objectives of competitiveness, social inclusion and sustainability have often been seen as conflicting—but the LDA will need to address head on the need to join up these agendas and identify mutually supportive links between the three objectives.</p></blockquote>
I shall in a moment ask the Minister for Transport in London—if it is she who will reply to the debate—how she anticipates that joining up will occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask that in particular because of an exchange between the Minister for Housing and Construction and my Parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington (Ms Buck), who is temporarily absent from the Committee, in which the hon. Lady raised the issue of the Paddington basin. I did not intervene at the time to remark that the Paddington basin is in my constituency, because I have good fraternal or sororial—relations with the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am wholly familiar with the problem that the hon. Lady mentioned in the context of her constituency. The Minister for Housing and Construction—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the right hon. Gentleman, but as that was the second occasion on which he inadvertently referred to me as the Minister for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1190</span>
Housing and Construction, may I correct him? I am the Minister for London and Construction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I freely acknowledge that there is a difference between London and construction, just as I drew to the attention of the Minister for Transport in London the fact that there is a difference between 1988 and 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, the Minister for London and Construction referred to the gross domestic product in central London being the highest in Europe. On Second Reading of the Immigration and Asylum Bill, I alluded to the fact that even my constituency—I acknowledge that the constituency of the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North is in a worse condition than mine is 48th out of the 659 constituencies in the land in terms of the standard poverty indices. The adjacency between rich and poor is extremely close, and one does not need to go outside the boundaries of the City of Westminster to observe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the need to join up the agendas of competitiveness, social inclusion and sustainability. Is the answer given by the Minister for London and Construction to the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North about using the Paddington basin to address problems of deprivation what will be envisaged by the London development partnership? Paddington basin needs to be developed to produce the optimum amount of employment, rather than particular kinds of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood was gracious enough not to refer to the Polish ships order made in the latter stages of the previous Labour Government, but some of us remember that episode, and the attempt to keep Chrysler afloat. It would be alarming and unfortunate, given all the marvellous things that have occurred to cause new Labour to look at the world through different eyes from those of the previous Labour Administration, if some similar attitudes returned, because of the way in which the three key objectives were put together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, I was inspired by my right hon. Friend's historical allusion to the order for Polish ships. If the Government were to support the move of Harefield hospital, in my constituency, which is the best cardio-thoracic hospital in the country, and the foremost in heart and lung transplantation, to the Paddington basin, merely to address the question of social exclusion in Westminster, that would be a most inappropriate use of resources, which would be bitterly resented by my constituents and would not serve any useful medical purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand what my hon. Friend is getting at; if so, I entirely understand why he said it. Before we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill, it would be helpful if the Minister were to explain how the Government think that these key objectives will be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example from my own experience that will provoke correspondence for me in my constituency. The SW1 postal district contains much low income
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1191</span>
housing, while the Wl postal district does not—there is some, but on nothing like the same scale. Over the years, I have received very few complaints about SW1 postal deliveries, but many about deliveries in Wl. I have always assumed that that was because the postmen who came in to serve the Wl postal district had to come from much further out, and the quality of postmen from whom Wl could choose differed from that of the postmen from whom SW1 could choose.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see how in an instance such as that intelligent planning could improve the situation, and I should not be averse to that. To return to my question, how will the three key objectives be configured by the agency in order to achieve the Government's objectives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton has been leading for the Liberal Democrats on this section of the Bill, but I should like to add some brief comments. I am one of only two members of the Committee whose constituency is or has been within the London docklands development corporation area. I share that distinction with the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who is on the other side of the river and the other side of the Committee. I should like to reflect on that experience in support of the clause standing part of the Bill. I am in favour of a development agency for London as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London docklands development Corporation was set up just before I was first elected to the House of Commons. As far as my constituency is concerned, it finally disappeared about a year ago, having rolled back its involvement over the years. Various people chaired the LDDC, and my predecessor became its vice-chairman. I was invited to join the board, but said that I would not because the role was incompatible with being a Member of Parliament for the area in question. The LDDC was keen to get potential critics on board rather than have them offside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience of that development corporation involved two frustrations. First, it was completely unaccountable other than through appointment by the Secretary of State. Therefore, if the Government of the day wanted, for example, to impose a compulsory purchase order or to extend its area, the Government-Whipped majority got the proposal through in the House of Commons. Occasionally we had debates in Committee Rooms about the issues, but the London view or the east-London view could not influence the outcome. We were the prisoner of the Government majority view of the day. That made people very frustrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, frustration arose over planning decisions. Those decisions were made by LDDC members on the planning committee, and nobody could ever do anything about who was on that Committee. At least in local government and Londonwide government, if people do not like the decisions that are made they can get rid of the people who made them. If we do not like the decisions that are made by our borough councillors on the planning
	<span class='label label-info column'>1192</span>
Committee we can, if we remember that at the next elections, get rid of them. The same applies to the Government in terms of national planning issues. It was a source of great frustration. I often went, on behalf of my constituents, to put a case to the planning Committee. Sometimes I won and sometimes I lost, but people were frustrated about having to go to here-today, gone-tomorrow appointees who may have had little link with the area in question. There was a huge democratic deficit. The lesson is that if development agencies are to be supported by and engaged in the community, they must have a democratic benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrast that experience with the debates that took place under the GLC in the 1970s, before the hon. Member for Brent, East became its leader. They were all about planning strategy on the south bank in the constituency of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), and in mine. The community and those who were elected to represent it and London took very good and very bold planning and development decisions. For example, they purchased land that was predominantly in the Under-Secretary's constituency to prevent an absolutely monstrous office development. Instead, the land was used for the Coin street housing development, which the Minister, and probably all Ministers, know. There was support thereafter from Conservative and Labour Ministers. The community benefited hugely because the strategic authority for London, working with the local communities and local people, took a development agency approach. That benefit to the local community has remained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to my last point. One of the benefits of the strategic authority's approach is that there is social housing at rents that people can afford. There are some wonderful social housing properties in co-operative flats on prime sites just along from the national theatre, near the Oxo tower. I have always taken the view that "ordinary people"—people on low incomes, who do not have the best opportunities elsewhere in life—ought to have an equal opportunity to get decent housing in the middle of our capital city. My hon. Friends and I were in Edinburgh last weekend for our spring conference. Many people there live in the middle of the city, and it has greatly benefited; it is a place of visitors, shopping, retail and living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a development agency that creates jobs and housing in a way that responds to community need and not not always to community demand. I say that because of one last frustration with the London Docklands development corporation, which I hope that the LDA will tackle. I want to give one illustration. Londoners suffered regularly because of development decisions that the development corporation made in the interests of developers; they were based on a concept called "regeneration" and were contrary to the interests of people in the community. As part of that process, small blocks of housing were knocked down and the land sold off with a promise to build social housing, which has never been delivered. Nice flats were built along a large part of the river—they were very nice for those who could afford £500,000, but not very good for those who could not. The whole process was driven by demand, not need. Of course, it was not entirely as I have described,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1193</span>
and there was some housing for rent. There is a need for mixed housing; I am not arguing for a monochrome London economy—that is the last thing we should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the development agency is to serve all Londoners properly, however, it must provide work, jobs, housing and recreation for all of them. That means—to take an example that unites other hon. Members and me—that the agency must provide housing for families from places such as Bangladesh, who need large houses because there may be many family members in their household. Such housing is difficult to find in local authority housing stock in Tower Hamlets, Lambeth and Southwark. If the agency is to serve all Londoners, there must be business units that allow people, at small cost, to start a business that will let them go on to be successful. Housing provision must respond first to the need for Londoners to have one home each before we start providing second and third homes for those who already have one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the LDA is set up, I hope that it will be more accountable than the docklands corporation and all the urban development corporations that were the idea of the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) in the early 1980s. We should reflect on the words of Baroness Thatcher about the inner cities; she made them sites for Conservative experimentation in the Conservative interest—Westminster may have tried that once too often. I hope that we have learnt from that lesson, and that development will occur in the interests of providing work, leisure and homes for all Londoners. I hope also that it will be biased towards Londoners who have so far been disadvantaged. If the LDA helps only people who have succeeded, it will not be working to the brief that it should fulfil. I hope that the lesson has been learnt, and I support the establishment of the new body on the basis that we will be able democratically to influence it. Whoever the mayor is, I am sure that he or she will be conscious of having to learn from the experiences of the development agencies of the 1980s and 1990s, which were not always happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall keep my remarks brief. I have a question about the relationship between the various plans, which was referred to by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. Will the Minister give the Committee a sense of how the Government believe that the various strategies fit together? I hope also that the Committee will find out whether a hierarchy will operate in the strategies produced by the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Friends of the Earth have drawn to my attention and to that of other hon. Members their concern about potential conflicts of interest between the spatial development plan and the economic development plan of the LDA, although I emphasise the word "potential". How might such conflict operate and how can it be avoided? I dare say that the Minister will tell us that those matters are dealt with by the mayor and the mayor's strategies, which will resolve or avoid such problems. Will the Minister pick up that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
I have another quick question. The relationship between the spatial development plan and the LDA's strategy is crucial, not least in the context of recycling brownfield sites and the development of land for housing in Greater London, and especially central London. Good housing and supporting infrastructure will be crucial to the delivery of the LDA's economic development strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to be clear about how the strategies fit together. A number of people outside the Committee, as well as me, find that these matters are unclear in the Bill. Will the Minister spell out in a little more detail how the strategies will link together? That issue, which was raised by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, is central to the part of the Bill under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall touch on the most recent question asked by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, which was based on a concern also expressed by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. The joined-up nature of the mayoral strategies and the working of the LDA with the other functioning bodies is a concern that has been expressed before. Clause 33(3)(b) requires all of the strategies to be consistent with one other. Clearly, they are consistent with each other under the driving force of the mayor. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I apologise. The two hon. Gentlemen are not really interchangeable; it is just getting late. I mean the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), who rightly expressed concerns about whether the spatial development plan could impact against the development agency's strategy. He was also rightly concerned about biodiversity and environmental matters, all of which will be part and parcel of the mayoral strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) highlighted past failures and the inability to consider the needs of people over the needs of property in its widest sense—I encapsulate his remarks in my own terms. He referred to the Coin street development, and said that people who have lived in a specific area all their lives, whose parents and grandparents have lived there all their lives and who rightly and justifiably claimed themselves to be Londoners with the interests of London at their heart, were too frequently ignored. Their visions for their own environment and for London as a whole were denied any credibility. That pattern has been replicated across the country wherever one cares to look.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey expressed concern—my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction talked about this in our earlier discussions—that this great city should not leave unacknowledged or unaltered the present situation, wherein there is clearly great wealth but also areas of quite scandalous and unbelievable poverty and deprivation. Indeed, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood touched on the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1195</span>
The mayoral strategy will be central in righting those wrongs, but not simply on the level of social justice or greater social cohesion; this great city needs the abilities of those people who are at the moment incapable of expressing and exploiting them. That, too, will be part and parcel of the mayoral strategy, which in practical terms will be expressed through the functional agencies. There is an obligation on the face of the Bill for those bodies to be consistent in terms of their strategies, their work and their awareness of each other and the overarching mayoral strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great failings of designating a bit of London as a development zone was that we literally ended up with a tale of two cities. One side of a road was developed and able to win grants and benefit from different planning permission, while the other side was not. Nothing was more divisive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entirely right. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, who I regret is not in her place, also touched on that point—I acknowledge that she was apparently speaking for part of the constituency of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. She noted that there can be developments that ignore the people who are already living in the area. People are sometimes drafted in from outside to take the construction and building jobs when there may well be abilities and skills in that very area which would be best utilised by the people who live there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was concerned that there should be published criteria on the funding of agencies that will also be the responsibility of the LDA. I think that he would agree that there are two issues here. The first is clarity, the second is propriety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to clarity, the LDA will in the main be dispensing money to achieve functions that will in effect have been delegated by Ministers. The single regeneration budget is a good example. National criteria will normally be in the public domain—again this applies to the single regeneration budget—and widely known. Current procedure is that once the national criteria are known, the Government office for London publishes more specific guidelines. It can also tailor the national guidelines to the specific circumstances of London. Clearly, the LDA will want to follow that pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On propriety, the LDA will have a chief financial officer and a monitoring officer, which follows standard local authority practice. The accounts will be audited annually, which is another check to ensure that the criteria for dispensing funds are defensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the activities involving financial support will be functions delegated by Ministers and, as such, to include in the Bill defined criteria would not be effective because ministerial perceptions might change, and therefore the criteria would change. To put such criteria in the Bill now would preclude the development and achievements for London and Londoners that the mayoral strategies will deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1196</span>
The provisions in clause 204 are on the preparation of the London development agency strategy. The LDA's role is to draft the strategy to keep it under review, following any directions and guidance given by the mayor. On receiving a draft strategy from the LDA, the mayor must publish the strategy, with or without modifications, as soon as it is practicable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy must be kept under review. The LDA may propose revisions to the mayor, who will publish any revised strategy. Before publishing the strategy, the mayor must carry out the consultations required by clause 34, and also consult representatives of employers and employees in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that having these requirements in the Bill will reassure the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. The disparity—the areas for potential conflict and competition of one against the other—will, because of the way in which we perceive the mayoral strategy being put in place and the way in which the functioning body's strategy must work within that strategy—as well as the amount of consultation that must take place, and the transparency inherent in publishing such proposals—will preclude the possibility of special interests pursuing a particular and narrow line, which the right hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned may arise. But under these provisions, and given this approach to what the mayor will be expected to deliver to Londoners, that will not be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief, but I that suspect that the speech that the hon. Lady has just delivered will be a quarry to which Opposition Members will return on a number of occasions. I am happy for the Committee to proceed to a decision on clause stand part, but I shall re-read the hon. Lady's speech because I honestly have not the faintest idea how the mayor will cope with the conflict. I genuinely did not follow the Minister's explanation. I shall not ask her to repeat it; I am simply saying that it is an explanation that I shall revisit, and I suspect that all Opposition members will do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This modest amendment would require the London Development Agency to send a copy of the audited accounts to the assembly as well as to the mayor. It is hardly a radical amendment, and I hope that the Government will accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey gave us the benefit of his experience, which showed us how accountability can improve the workings of an organisation. We are suggesting that that accountability comes from receiving a set of audited accounts. Given the positive indications that the Minister is making, I shall conclude my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 1039 is similar, except that it would require that to be done by e-mail. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> We are progressive in the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 74 proposes an annual debate of the report and accounts of the London development agency. I expect that the Minister will say that that will happen anyway, but I look forward to hearing him explain how that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton moved his amendment with admirably brevity; he deserves a reward. He proposes to ensure that a copy of the annual accounts of the LDA is sent to the assembly, as well as to the mayor. That is an entirely reasonable request, and, subject to consideration of the drafting to ensure consistency with other parts of the Bill, we propose to accept at least its sentiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that that provision was not included in the Bill is that the clause amends the relevant passage of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998, which requires that RDA accounts should be sent to the Secretary of State. In drafting the clause, we substituted the mayor for the Secretary of State, but the hon. Gentleman has rightly highlighted the importance of the assembly receiving a copy of the accounts. That is our intention, and we aim to amend the Bill accordingly, if he will withdraw his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be less kind with the Conservative proposals. The hon. Member for Croydon, South, although admirably brief in speaking to his amendment, slightly misled the Committee about its effect. Whereas amendment No. 1012 would require one additional copy of the accounts to be sent, amendment No. 1039 would probably require more than 100 additional copies to be sent—I reached that figure by calculating that there would need to be at least 33 copies for the London boroughs, and presuming that there are at least 66 major businesses in London. That would be a little excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unnecessary to impose such an obligation. The accounts will be published because they will be audited subject to the rules set by the Audit Commission, which will choose the auditors. They will be publicly available, so that those who want to see a copy of them will have access to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assembly, which is mentioned in new clause 47, will of course receive a copy of the audited accounts, as I have already said, and will be free to determine when, where and how to debate them. As that will be one of the most important scrutiny functions of the GLA, I have no
	<span class='label label-info column'>1198</span>
doubt that an appropriate opportunity will be taken to debate the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will understand why we must ask him to withdraw his amendment: the wording must be consistent with that elsewhere in the Bill. On the principle that we intend to accept the spirit of his amendment, I hope that he will agree to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, we must ensure consistency between the different parts of the Bill, and that consistency has not been achieved in one area in relation to economic development strategy—ensuring consistency with national economic development strategies, which is an obligation placed on other regional development agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In this part of the Bill, unlike the other parts, we are not framing our own legislation—we are working on amendments to the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fifteenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1040, in page 192, leave out lines 44 and 45 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) This section does not apply in relation to London where the Development Agency shall have regard to the views of in the exercise of its functions and regularly directly consult with small, medium and large businesses in London and with their representative bodies.".</p></blockquote>
The Bill apparently contains no obligation for the LDA to consult business. There are about 500,000 businesses in London, the overwhelming majority of which are small or medium sized. They are represented by a wide range of representative bodies. However, many smaller businesses are not members of any trade body, and the LDA could fall into the trap of speaking only to established business organisations. The amendment is intended to probe the method by which the LDA will consult all businesses rather than just the big names. The LDA will need to establish support for its programme and to know about trends and developments in business. We therefore hope that it will meet regularly with smaller and medium-sized businesses to gauge their opinions. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 empowers the Secretary of State to designate a suitable body in a region to be a regional chamber. He can then require the relevant regional development agency to have regard to its views and consult it on the exercise of its functions. Schedule 15 removes that provision for London. Business representation on the LDA board and requirements for wider consultation on the LDA strategy have an equivalent effect with respect to the exercise of the LDA's functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am cognisant of the hon. Gentleman's concern about small businesses. We believe that the requirement to consult small businesses and listen to their concerns is already in the Bill. The scrutiny powers of the assembly provide that key channel for local views to be fed into the LDA. Indeed, clause 25 requires the GLA to consult business and others on the exercise of its functions which have an impact on the interests of business. The results of those consultations will no doubt, where relevant, be fed to the LDA board. The Committee has already considered and approved these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is undoubtedly the case that this will be the engine and the powerhouse—the area that can really drive forward employment opportunities in small and medium-sized businesses. There is no Question about that, given the amount of evidence to support it. The importance of this area in terms of the national economy was highlighted by the steps that were taken by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget. That is why no mayor and certainly no LDA would consider setting up any strategy for London without consulting its small and medium-sized
	<span class='label label-info column'>1200</span>
enterprises. They are vital in creating a sustainable economy and, because their activities are often local, they have a major part to play in the other wider strategy, which should ensure that it is not necessary to travel miles to work. That role will be intrinsic in the development of a transport strategy and in keeping city areas alive and burgeoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am learning in this Committee, and I intend to be very brief. We will see whether I am rewarded as I have been previously. The proposed new clause is intended to probe.
