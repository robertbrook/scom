	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we broke for an invigorating, refreshing cup of tea, the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and a distinguished north-west London colleague, the hon. Member for Uxbridge, dared to challenge the massed ranks of Government supporters present this evening with comments about their silence on the broad principle of road charging. I felt that it would not be prudent to respond but could not resist the temptation. It is a great shame that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is not in his usual place. He was seen in full evening dress heading out to some salubrious occasion, but it is not for me to suggest where he may be, although there are several clubs in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman tried to make the Committee's flesh creep with a horrifying vision of City bond dealers and probably Euroshare dealers being unable to get to their place of work to compare braces because of traffic congestion. While I have every sympathy for the flaming Ferraris who are unable to park their eponymous trademarks outside their bijou mansions in Hillingdon, we have an obligation to address the issue. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Uxbridge has associated himself with the group, whose most famous member is Lord Archer's son. I have not seen the hon. Member for Uxbridge in that context but I am prepared to stretch the imagination to try to encompass it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental point about the thrust of the comments of the hon. Member for Ruislip-North. He admitted, as would anyone, that there is a crisis in transport in our city. Yet he chooses to deny that any element of responsibility for that appends to car drivers. I speak as one, as most of us are. It is absurd to attempt to addreses the problem of London's traffic congestion without mentioning car ownership and responsibilities. The idea that somehow we can square the circle of London's traffic problems without placing some sort of imposition—if that is not too strong a word—on drivers is simply untenable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that it would be wrong to do that. I say that it is recognised that car ownership carries responsibilities as well as rights, and that car drivers may well drive cars for the reason given by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood—that they live in a deserted, treeless tundra on the Middlesex-Hertfordshire borders, where there is no public transport, where the nearest thing to mechanised
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
transport is a place flying overhead and where the only option is the Morris 1000. However, Londoners throughout the city have to take some responsibility for the crisis. If that involves a small measure of financial sacrifice, so be it. We are not individuals, we are citizens of our city, so we have responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also tried to imply that business people were queueing up to flee the metropolis ahead of the oncoming nightmare of road charging. Information that I have received does not bear that out. The Automobile Association has generously faxed us from a mobile machine to say that it welcomes the Government's rethink on road user charging. It calls for a commitment to dedicate all the net surplus to London Transport's investment, and makes various other points that the Government have taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Robert Gordon Clarke, writing for London First, saw road user charging as providing for the first time an effective means of reducing traffic congestion while at the same time raising revenue that could be used to improve London's transport system. That is so obvious that the absurdity libertarian, almost anarchic viewpoint—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of anarchic libertarianism I shall certainly give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It takes an anarchist to recognise one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the London chamber of commerce said that the plans were "wholly unacceptable" to the business community. It was unfair and 	<br><blockquote><p>"would amount to another tax on the capital".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is like a giraffe wandering through the forest plucking the occasional fruit from the tree tops and bringing it back for our delectation. He also manages to be like an Alabama sharecropper, choosing which item to bring forward. People can quote from a multitude of documentation. I respect, as do all members of the Committee, London First and I chose to quote Robert Gordon Clarke's statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to delay the Committee but it is important to put two points on the record. First, there is no shortage of Labour Members prepared to support the principle of road charging. I cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but I am sure that if you wished to hear, Mr. Benton, endogenous speeches from us throughout the night, you would certainly hear them. Were the liberal concept of time allowed to continue throughout the night, I have no doubt that numerous speeches from my colleagues would be forthcoming—all of them far better, literate and apposite than anything that I could offer the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is to reiterate my main theme of road charging, which we need to grasp. Every civilised city in the world recognises the rights and responsibilities of car ownership. It may be a useful populist soundbite to talk about infringements on the liberty of car drivers, but most responsible car
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
drivers—I hope, as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is absent, that I can include all hon. Members in the Room—recognise that while there are enormous advantages of driving in this city, there are also enormous responsibilities. In recognition of that principle, I strongly support the Government and I hope that when the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northood is curled up in his Winnie the Pooh duvet browsing through 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will reflect on these gentle words of admonition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak to some of the amendments tabled by ourselves and to some tabled by the Conservatives. The first issue is whether the 10-year old period referred to in paragraph 16 is genuinely a 10-year period. That needs further clarification after the extensive exchange that took place before tea. Paragraph 16 makes it clear that the initial period is 10 years, provided that the scheme starts within 10 years of the GLA's inception. It is important to read paragraph 16(1) in the context of the fact that the initial period is linked to the way in which the provision works. The 10-year period is not what it seems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has already explained, the Secretary of State can, under paragraph 17(6)(a), publish regulations to alter the scheme and effectively define it as a new scheme. That gives the Secretary of State the ability to move the goalposts. For example, an initial scheme starting in 2005 and due to run until 2015 could, under the provisions, be foreshortened and run only to 2010. There will also be a period for debate before any schemes are implemented. At the very least, we could not expect the scheme to be in place for the first two years of the operation of the GLA, and I suspect that it might take longer than that. If the 10-year period is foreshortened, the full benefits of that limited protection will not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he reaches that bizarre conclusion? The Bill makes it clear that the mayor is expected to introduce a scheme within 10 years of the GLA's inception. Any scheme that is introduced will run for 10 years. How does the Bill make it possible for that 10-year period to be curtailed for a specific scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is simple. It is linked to my point and to the Minister's inadequate responses to the interventions of my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. We are worried about how we construe the meaning of paragraphs 16(1) and 17(6) and how they work in conjunction with paragraph 16(7). The definition of the initial period of the charging scheme is critical. That is in the Secretary of State's hands and he can through his regulation-making powers, rewrite and redetermine the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain the purpose of initial period definition in paragraph 16(7)(b)? It clearly states that "such longer period"— longer than 10 years—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the Secretary of State may allow in the case of any particular scheme."</p></blockquote>
We are talking about a range of schemes, not one scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We established in earlier exchanges between my hon. Friend and the Minister that the mayor may present a change as part of the revised scheme or programme that he or she will submit every four years. A change of mayor or a change to the scheme may trigger the Secretary of State's exercising of those powers. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Harrow, East to the limited extent that a scheme that remains unchanged would run for the 10-year period. But a scheme that is changed could lead to the removal of the initial period and the foreshortening of the 10-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clearly the issue of regulations in paragraph 17(6) that is causing the hon. Gentleman some difficulty. The regulations will define whether a scheme is new or amended. Even if the Secretary of State decides that a scheme is amended, it will still run for 10 years and will retain every penny. If anew mayor takes office and defines a new scheme, the new scheme will take priority over the previous scheme and will run for the complete 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the Minister's word on that. However, we do not believe that that construction will be put on the paragraphs. The combination of the clauses grants the Secretary of State the ability to foreshorten the initial period, which negates the benefits that the Government are advancing for 10-year ring-fencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 16(3) and (4) allow the Secretary of State to decide whether something represents value for money without defining what that is. This is a Humpty-Dumpty paragraph—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A technical term!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a technical term—it was used by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. Humpty Dumpty said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean".</p></blockquote>
The paragraph gives the Secretary of State the power to decide whether there is value for money, and value for money is whatever the Secretary of State wants it to be. Again, that gives rise to concern, because the paragraphs will enable the Secretary of State to redefine the boundaries and move the goalposts, so that the ring-fencing will not be as solid as it first appears to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In exchanges between my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and the Minister for London, we were assured that the guidance to be published on this matter would be broad brush. How can a subsequent paragraph then say that that broad-brush guidance will have to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1103</span>
complied with specifically? It is the link between guidance and strict compliance with that guidance that gives us cause for concern. I do not see how anyone can say that they have complied strictly with broad-brush guidance. Surely it would be better to delete the reference to "comply with" and simply have the words that are in many other parts of the Bill—"have regard for"? To have regard for broad-brush guidance would be more appropriate and would give more sense to what the Government are attempting to secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are concerned that the 10-year period is not as solid as it first seems. It is our view that no mayor will wish to impose charges without having the confidence that the funds that will be generated through this charging system and the one that we shall come to later are ring-fenced not for 10 years but in perpetuity. As London First and others have identified in their briefings, it is clear that primary investment in Greater London's transport infrastructure will not be achieved to anyone's satisfaction, let alone the Government's, within 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To secure the necessary finance and ensure investment in our infrastructure, which the Minister for London herself identified as necessary to improve the capacity of surface rail and tube networks, the mayor must be certain of a guaranteed revenue stream from the charges. That guarantee is not there. Ten years is not enough to put in place the long-term, rolling investment programmes that will be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are reploughing a furrow that we have been up and down several times today. As I made clear in my detailed introduction, it would be entirely possible for a scheme to run for longer than 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have said on a number of occasions, we accept, because of the benign nature of current Ministers, that it would undoubtedly be the case, but these Ministers will not always hold the posts or exercise the powers that the Bill confers. That is why we are concerned. A different, less benign Secretary of State with a different agenda for the allocation of resources may take a different view. That is why the Bill should be more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speaking from his and his hon. Friends' direct experience, but if such a situation should arise, the Secretary of State will have to demonstrate that that decision is reasonable, as any Secretary of State must do for any decision under any Bill. If the mayor believes that the decision is not reasonable, the powers of judicial review are open to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that at some point those matters will be explored in the courts. However, we should prefer, through amendments and debates in the Committee, to ensure that that will not be necessary. The Committee will probably not reach consensus on that tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment on the interesting reversal of the tale of Dick Whittington, to which the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred. Whereas Dick Whittington moved from rags to riches, we learned tonight that a Conservative mayor will move from
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
riches to rags, because he will not have access to new streams of funding and will not have the means, through the council tax, to generate any income. That will not be good for London's transportation system. The Committee has defined the clear difference in the approach that a Conservative mayor will be allowed to take: he will simply be a voice in the wilderness, because he will not have the means to deliver what he wants to deliver and what Londoners expect him to deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek the Government's views on exemptions for disabled people. I hope that the Government will be receptive because there have been exchanges on orange badge holders. The simple answer may be to exempt orange badge holders and let the mayor define a scheme for road user charging. However, we would like the Bill to enable the mayor to consult on the best way of exempting disabled people. A scheme must not be susceptible to misuse and it must be supported by Londoners because they believe it to be fair to all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the amendment because it is right for the mayor to have the powers provided. There should be an opportunity for debate during the election campaign next year on whether a scheme should be in place and what rates should operate. We know from the Committee that the Conservatives will walk off the field when that debate takes place and that the Labour party will tie its candidate's hands behind his back for the simple reason that Labour's mayoral candidate will be asked, "How can you know for certain that your Government will not fund London's transport system from Government grants?" No mayoral candidate will know and that will undermine his ability to make sensible investment strategies and present them to Londoners. The candidates will be cross-examined on that, but they will have no answer because the Government have not given an answer in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the other furrow that we have ploughed excessively, not only today but on other occasions. I repeat that the Government have made it abundantly clear that decisions on the PPP are entirely dependent on the Government being convinced that it offers best value, not only for taxpayers, but in delivering services to Londoners. The fantasy scenario presented by the hon. Gentleman again this evening is entirely without foundation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that comment because it enables me to make two points. I was speaking of additionality generally and the concern that when the charges are introduced, there might be a compensatory reduction in funds from the Exchequer. That concern has been expressed by many people outside the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given numerous assurances that best value will apply, so why cannot the Secretary of State go one step further and specifically exclude that in the Bill? I do not understand, when the Government have been so emphatic, why they cannot put that in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1105</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is clearly aware of the hon. Gentleman's inability to understand and he is in danger of making the field a dust bowl. We have been down the furrow of additionality. It is clear that any revenue raised by road charging or private non-parking residential levies will be additional funds to the mayor. It is rather odd that the hon. Gentleman castigates the hon. Member for Croydon, South for the clear Conservative policy not to provide any new funding for an incoming mayor, but at the same time tries to refute the aspects of our policy that will provide precisely the additional funding to which he avers he is prepared to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is quite a lot of dust, but it is being thrown up by the Government to obscure the facts. My conclusion is that, despite its faults, the clause should be in the Bill. We support it, but the Government should'—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman make that noise when he knows that that has been our position throughout? There are undoubtedly some matters that need to be further explored. We look forward to supporting the clause and to hearing the Government's response, especially on exemptions for disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and to put the record straight: he is not in any dubious establishment, unless the hon. Member for Ealing, North regards Madam Speaker's Apartments as dubious. I am sure that he does not. I would also note that although the consitutency of Ruislip-Northwood is to the north of mine, it is far from being treeless and it is not a tundra waste. In fact, many people in Uxbridge—somewhat misguidedly—consider it to be a leafy paradise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amused by the idea of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood being tucked up under his Winnie the Pooh duvet. I must confess that the hon. Member for Ealing, North was probably confusing my hon. Friend with me. When my young children come into my bed in the middle of the night, I have to creep off to their room. I often wake up underneath a Thomas the Tank Engine duvet and walls adorned with Beatrix Potter characters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must congratulate the hon. Member for Ealing, North on describing my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South as a giraffe—well known for being a noble creature overseeing all around. I thought back to my days in the savannah and wondered what the hon. Member for Ealing, North reminded me of. I realised after a while that he was like that well-known skulking denizen of the scrub, the dik-dik.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the matters before us. With regard to the claim that business communities welcome the provisions that are before us, the Uxbridge business community and, I would say, many business communities throughout the outer London areas in particular, consider the provisions as serious and a potential danger to their economic position. I have an open mind about road charging as a general concept,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
but one thing worries me. The idea of road charging is to get people off the road, but if public transport has not been improved first, will not many people who have been put off from taking their cars into London, on finding that public transport has not been improved because the funds have not flowed through, revert to using their cars?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the whole idea is a bit of an idyllic concept, a sort of environmental heaven. It is therefore less about the Purley way, which we heard about earlier, and more to do with the pearly gates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My problem with the Government's approach is the idea that political transport will somehow be superior to transport that is run on a more commercial basis. Why is the assumption made that politicians—which is, after all, what the mayor and assembly members will be—will be able to manage and run a successful and efficient transport system? It puzzles me considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that even the Labour party had moved beyond its traditional belief in the public ownership and management of such things as transport systems. Here, however, the Government are in danger of reverting to what dogged the Labour party for decades and from which they recently tried to persuade us that they had shaken themselves free. Here we are being offered a political transport system for London. The Labour party, showing that it has not really shaken off its old beliefs, is telling us that because a transport system will be run by a politician, it will therefore work well and be environmentally pure and efficient. I do not accept that, and I do not think that the people of London will accept it, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What also concerns me about the Government's approach—my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South referred to this earlier—is that however one designs a road-pricing system, it is bound to be regressive. Upper income people will find ways of continuing to use their cars on the roads—their transport method of choice—while lower income groups will be forced out of their cars and on to a public transport system which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge said, may not at the early stage, be the new improved version that the Government have promised us. Those on lower income levels and with fewer means will end up being unable to use their cars, however justified that use may be—it may be for odd shift work or whatever. Such people will be forced on to the still inadequate public transport system, if that is how people want to characterise it. We have the odd phenomenon of the Labour party punishing people on lower income levels. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, that is not quite what we thought—or, I suspect, what its members used to think—the Labour party was about. Perhaps it has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
The next aspect of the issue arises from the complexity and bureaucracy that will almost inevitably arise from an approach of the kind that we are contemplating. One has only to glance at the words before us to see what I mean. The schedule refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"contents of a charging scheme",</p></blockquote>
and states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a charging scheme must…designate the area…specify the classes of motor vehicles…designate…roads…specify the charges".</p></blockquote>
It must, of necessity, do all those things if it is to make any sense. That already implies an extremely detailed and bureaucratic approach of a sort that will, of necessity, be complex. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said, it is bizarre that the Government are suggesting that London should be the guinea pig for all of that. We will not attempt to make the provisions work in a more controlled, more manageable area; no, we shall embark on them in, of all places, London. That will give the Government's approach the worst possible chance of succeeding, rather than the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, I do not have a principled objection to road or congestion charging. I believe passionately in the market and in market forces, and do not find the idea of charging inimical. I want, however, to see evidence that it can be made to work before we embark on it in London, rather than anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reinforce my point, I should mention the provison on charges in paragraph 10(1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A charging scheme shall specify or describe the events by reference to the happening of which a charge is imposed by the charging scheme in favour of a motor vehicle being kept or used on a road in a charging area."</p></blockquote>
That is the sort of gobbledegook that I thought we had managed largely to leave behind us, but no—there it is. I defy anyone in the Committee to explain what that means. I do not defy the Minister to explain it because she no doubt knows—the voluminous notes in front of her no doubt decode it for her. Perhaps she will share the explanation with the Committee at some appropriate stage so that we know what that subparagraph means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A charging scheme may make provision in relation to the manner in which charges are to be made, collected, recorded or paid."</p></blockquote>
Then, however, it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"different days…different times of day…different parts of a charging area… different classes of motor vehicles."</p></blockquote>
One can readily see the complexity that will be involved in what amounts to an enormous experiment or an act of faith. The belief is that the provisions will somehow solve the problems in London that have been described to us. I find that difficult to believe and to swallow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the subject of orange badge holders, which has been raised several times in different contexts. I completely support the argument that there should be exemptions or special treatment for orange badge holders, but I add my own rider to that. The giving of the badges must be much more
	<span class='label label-info column'>1108</span>
tightly and effectively controlled than it has been hitherto. Of course, we should want to help those with disabilities. However, I am always worried when I see—I do not know whether other members of the Committee have shared this experience—people who have the badges skip out of their vehicles and positively run round the supermarket in a rather healthy and normal way. All that I am saying is that we should, while trying to build in a provision for orange badge holders, introduce a provision to ensure that those valuable badges should be given only to people who need them and who can demonstrate beyond doubt that they deserve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that one way of dealing with what may be a minority of abuse would be to consult about a system that gives the badge or pass to the individual rather than to the vehicle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that such a system would make a great deal of sense. The proposal illustrates the point that I was making, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I believe that a consultation approach may be desirable if it can sort out a long-standing problem, which, perhaps for understandable reasons, some people are nervous to approach. At the first flush, the hon. Gentleman's suggestion attracts me and I believe that it could be adopted. I offer that as a positive thought, and I hope that we can bear it in mind when considering the matter as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to accept the approach that the Government are trying to persuade us to adopt. They are introducing a system of mind-boggling complexity that is untried and untested, and are handing over to politicians a very complicated problem. None of that gives me any confidence that the system will work, so I am at one with the reservations expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. I remain to be persuaded, and until the Minister persuades me I shall not give the measures my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contrary to the remarks of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, I have not quoted Humpty Dumpty at any stage in the Committee's proceedings, although I admit that I well might have done. The hon. Member for Ealing, North compared my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to a giraffe. One of the characteristics of a giraffe is that it spends 75 per cent, of its waking hours foraging for food or exploring how it can get it. I take considerable pride and pleasure in the fact that Opposition Members are led in Committee by an hon. Member whose efforts on our behalf have been so assiduous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have apologised to you, Mr. Benton, for not appreciating that you had already ruled on the dinner break when I rose to ask about it. We are prisoners of the milestoning method, and of the Government's cornucopia of new clauses and new schedules in the transport element of the Bill. I pressed—I admit boringly—to find out why the Government have changed the Bill so extensively, and on whether they had always intended to use the technique that they have used—to include anodyne references to the Secretary of State that were bound to attract
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1109</span>
amendments and then to take the flak until they produced what they always intended to produce when they were ready to do so. They might, however, have been driven off what the Bill appeared to state in the first instance by the attacks made on them by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak with marginal pride of amendment No. 419, which we are still able to discuss, because we have not yet dealt with Government amendment No. 989 to schedule 13. I am delighted that a small amendment of mine has been followed by 34 more amendments in the Chairman's selection, and that it may have helped to persuade the Government to retreat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Thursday, the Minister for London and Construction made a good fist of explaining that the Government had been driven off their original intention and that they had been responsive to the Committee. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new schedule to replace schedule 13 was tabled on Tuesday evening and the new schedule to replace schedule 14 on Wednesday evening, with a view to giving members of the Committee the maximum time possible to consider them before they are debated next Tuesday."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 4 March 1999; c. 971.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister will agree that had the amendments been tabled earlier than Tuesday and Wednesday, we would have had even more time to consider them before today's debate. I acknowledge that the issues are complex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are ever to take seriously the idea that people outside the Committee should always have an opportunity to study what is proposed, either in a Bill or in amendments to it, the time scale described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster is completely unacceptable. Has my right hon. Friend had the opportunity to hear from any of his many contacts in the City or in Westminster about the Government amendments, or does he share my fear that they are to be rammed through without anyone outside being given any chance to read or comment on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. A number of amendments originally tabled to schedule 13, which the Government have admitted are what caused them to change their approach to the Bill, are evidence of the amount of work that was under way on the Bill as drafted. Even some of the material that we have received during the past two or three days has referred to schedules 13 and 14, under the impressiosn that we would still be discussing them, and not realising that because of the course that the Bill was taking, they would not be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Transport in London has consistently claimed the overwhelming endorsement of London and Londoners for the Government's proposals. I have previously alluded to the hon. Lady's tendency to fall back on particular phrases as a form of therapy in what I will not call moments of stress, but when there is debate and controversy in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
When we debated these matters downstairs, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey drew attention to the fact that the Government did not secure 50 per cent, of the votes at the general election, which therefore cannot be regarded as an overwhelming endorsement. In the referendum last May, only a third of Londoners voted, and only 25 per cent, voted in favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for London and Construction has tried the marvellous technique of referring to something called a 72 per cent, majority, as if the majority in favour of the Government's proposal expressed as a differential were 72 per cent. If he refers to his words on Second Reading, he will discover that he said that. It would have been slightly happier if he had said that 72 per cent, voted for the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poor hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was elected by a majority of 0.1 per cent., in terms of the differential. It would be understandable if the hon. Gentleman alluded to the total number of votes that he had scored, in order to get away from the differential, but the Government's tendency to fall back on what they call the overwhelming endorsement of Londoners for their proposal carries some risks for them. Frankly, the test of public opinion is still to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A notable two-volume history of London Transport describes the irony that it was precisely in 1933, when London Transport was finally put together, that people finally developed the habit of coming in from Uxbridge of from Ruislip-Northwood in their cars to spend an evening in the west end. It was at precisely the moment at which the car began to take over that public transport was brought together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New schedule 8, to which the Minister spoke at length, makes a good shot at pulling the matter together. I am a generous fellow, and I pay tribute to the fact that it is reasonably comprehensive. It took the Minister an hour to speak to it. I intend no criticism of her by that; my criticism relates to the total amount of time that we have had in which to discuss the subject. It took her an hour to explain the schedule, which in a sense is an index of its comprehensiveness, but that used up some of the time available to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a highly entertaining speech, in which the dik-dik was introduced into our affairs for the first time, my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge alluded to the problem of the advance of public transport being concurrent rather than constructive—in relation to those who may not use it at present, but whom the Government want to use it. That is of course the principle of the push-me, pull-you. In the context of buses, the problem is that if I am a car driver and it would be helpful if I were to fill one of the 24 places available on the bus immediately ahead of me, that appears to be grand—I will fill one of the 24 places— but unless the 23 people who are also driving cars make the same decision, the bus will not get through at a pace that will justify the vote of confidence that I, as a driver, seek to place in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to come back to additionality. The Minister has satisfied me regarding the commitment and direction of resources, although it took quite a long
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1111</span>
time to hone the definition so that all the loose ends were tied up. I understand that the 10-year guarantee is in the Bill, although I share the unease that several members of the Committee have expressed about what will happen at the end of 10 years, when it appears that we will enter a particularly grey and discretionary area. I dare say, given my advanced age, that I shall not be sitting in this Committee in 10 years' time when that moment arrives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not believe that the issue of additionality is as copper bottomed as the Minister implied earlier today. She relies on new schedule 8, and I understand the Government's pride at having won the battle of hypothecation over the Treasury. Everyone would have to agree that it has been a notable victory. I was a Treasury Minister for four years, and I know its attachment to what some might think of as shibboleths. I also suspect that there was a fair amount of creative tension between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Treasury while the matter was sorted out, and that the 10-year issue is an index of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not confident that what the Minister has outlined will ensure additionality. As it is easier on these occasions to use documentation that is available to everybody, because we then know what the hymn sheet says, I remind the hon. Lady of the observations in London First's submission, which came late in the day in anticipation of this debate. It draws attention to London Transport's recent publication, "Developing Integrated Transport", which shows that large parts of the underground system in the central area will be, in London Transport's own words, "very crowded" in 2001—that is, after the opening of the Jubilee line extension. That is the scenario that those of us who must decide whether to abandon our cars and take public transport will be facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London First goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the current year, government grants for London Transport will be £470 million, excluding the Jubilee Line Extension and Croydon Tramlink, and including £129 million, carried forward from 1997–1998".</p></blockquote>
The provenance of that is the London Transport annual report for 1997–98. The document goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nearly all of this grant is for the core Underground system. If the Government's arithmetic proves correct, the PPPs"</p></blockquote>
since that sentence was written, we have had the news about the PPP and the London Underground, but I will stick with London First's language—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will result in a very big saving in government expenditure. This saving should be used to finance other high priority investment in London—for example the East London Line Extension, and starting work on the new Thameslink Station at Kings Cross/St. Pancras ahead of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link—rather than leaving these to be funded by road user charges."</p></blockquote>
I remember referring to both projects—in particular, to starting work on the new Thameslink station ahead of the channel tunnel rail link—during our most recent debate on London Underground; the silence was remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has satisfied me that there will be watertight accounting for what she regards as the new charging scheme. However, I get no sense of how the issue that I have just described is covered, protected
	<span class='label label-info column'>1112</span>
against or guaranteed. We have watertight accounting systems for the new charging systems, but there is nothing to say that they will not be used as a substitute. The fact that something is watertight does not prevent it from being a watertight substitute. I therefore return to the question that I asked the Minister this morning—where does the Bill provide legislative cover that demonstrates that additionality will be guaranteed? We are now within half an hour of concluding our deliberations. It is clear that under the modernisers' milestoning—the Government's timetabling of the production of their new clauses and schedules in the areas that we are discussing—the one thing that Londoners are not going to get is decent scrutiny of the matters that lie between now and 9.50 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman that if scrutiny of the remaining schedules is indeed inadequate, the fault clearly lies with Opposition Members. I am tempted to say that what we have had to endure since we returned from the dinner break is a blatant example of empty filibustering by Opposition Members. The agreements that were entered into regarding our discussions this evening were agreed last week by everyone who is responsible for doing so.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The substantive point was made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster about additionality, which other hon. Members mentioned today. The right hon. Gentleman suspects that such revenues as will be raised by the schemes will fund the public-private partnership. As I have had occasion to say to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, revenues raised from congestion charging were not part or parcel of the modelling that was agreed for the contracts that will be submitted to the private sector for competition. I also reiterate that the Government have a clear and stated policy that the PPP must give best value for money and deliver the best quality services for Londoners. The new charges will be hypothecated and every penny of the net proceeds will be spent on delivering the Mayor's integrated transport strategy. Such revenue will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1114</span>
need to be used for the public-private partnership, as that scheme is a way of attracting the billions of pounds that the underground needs, which is due in no small part to decades of neglect under Conservative Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify the conerns of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) about gobbledegook. Paragraph 10(1) means, in essence, that the scheme will describe how a charge is incurred, either by crossing the cordon, travelling or being in an area. I trust that that clarifies the matter. The right hon. Gentleman treated the Committee to his inevitable excoriation of planning, which he loathes in almost the same way that he dislikes the Government. I well understand that little in the proposal could move him from that traditional and old-fashioned position. The argument that to do nothing is infinitely better than doing anything is not the way to tackle any of the problems that currently beset London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst touched on the issue of exemptions, which we have already made clear will be a decision for the mayor. He also touched on the orange badge scheme. It will be helpful for him to know that the Government have written to all local authorities, which are the responsible bodies for awarding organge badge schemes and providing details on numbers and other such matters. The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, or DPTAC—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a slip of the tongue. It is concerned about what seems to be a large increase in the number of orange badge holders. I can tell him and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that it could be entirely within the scheme for someone to display an orange badge on his car and then trot into a supermarket to do his shopping. The orange badge holder may be blind or so disabled that he cannot get out of the car. The person whom hon. Members have seen going in and out of supermarkets could be the carer of the badge holder, who is acting entirely legally.

The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) rightly raised the concerns of business within his community. That point was made in a different way by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who was concerned more about the independence of Croydon. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) made a similar point, and I regret that he is not in his place. His concern was again about the possibility of the scheme impacting on the commercial viability of London as a whole. The concerns of both the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood were for their own constituencies, but they highlighted the need for the mayor to have a strategic plan on congestion charging and on raising the necessary revenues.

It would be absurd to have ad hoc schemes. As I have already said, we do not regard such schemes as being based on a beggar my neighbour principle. We

The Government have made it abundantly clear that the potential for raising the dedicated income stream to improve public transport nationally will be introduced when legislative time allows. There must be protection not only for industry and business, but for residents because the ad hoc imposition of schemes could reduce, in effect, to a rat-runners charter—a point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood—which is why it is so important that the mayor should have a strategy and that the boroughs should insist on delivering it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go down the furrow ploughed again by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam about ring-fencing being a given for perpetuity. He touched on the issue of exemptions, but I have made it abundantly clear that they will be decisions for the mayor. He also touched on the requirement to consult certain specified bodies. We have already given a commitment on clauses 25 and 34 that we shall re-address the issue, but we are not in the business of putting endless lists in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to specific amendments on which, in some instances, he will push the Committee to a vote. He was much concerned with the idea that the schemes that we have been discussing this afternoon represented taxation without representation. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster tellingly pointed out, the mandate for the mayor's schemes will be given by the population of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no more direct democratic mandate than the fact that it is the people of London who will decide who they wish to be mayor. They will vote the mayor into office, and I have little doubt that a serious contender for the office of mayor will not only be asked questions but will have questions on the issues that we have been discussing today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not like saying that the Prime Minister has a mandate to carry out the Labour party's manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not argue with that. However, the hon. Gentleman is talking about a specific party. As we know, the Government's requirement is that the Cabinet has responsibility for the manifesto. We are proposing a new form of government and the political power within the GLA—the power that will decide a strategy—will be that of the mayor. The democratic
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
mandate that validates mayoral decisions is the people of London. The role of the assembly is very important, but it is that of scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly agreed that the Prime Minister has the mandate. After all, he won the general election. However, it is the House of Commons that gives him legitimacy. The right hon. Gentleman introduces the policy and the House endorses it. All we are asking is that the mayor introduces the policy; it will be his initiative and it will be up to him to persuade the assembly that that it is the right thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an entirely different balance and relationship; the remit that is the direct responsibility of the mayor is infinitely more concentrated than the responsibilities of the Government. The mayor has been mandated by the voice of the people of London. The assembly's responsibilities, again by the will of the people of London, will be to act as a scrutinising power. The central driving force of the creation of the type of integrated strategies across the remit of the mayor's responsibility is for the mayor, and that is a decision for the people of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South spoke specifically to amendment (c), when he argued that the authority is not defined. Paragraph 4 of new schedule 8 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authority making the scheme".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 1 of the new schedule defines the authority that makes the scheme as the "charging authority", so the authority is either Transport for London or the borough, thus the definition of "authority" is on the face of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking to amendment (d), the hon. Gentleman referred to the power of Croydon. As I was saying to the hon. Member for Uxbridge, I want to ensure that there cannot be any beggar-my-neighbour policy in the introduction of charging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what amendment (d) says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my interpretation of the concerns that have been expressed by the Member for Uxbridge and, in a sense, by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, that it is essential that the mayor ensures consistency and compatibility between the different charging schemes, which will be introduced by the authority and the borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment (g), the hon. Member for Croydon, South argued for such charging schemes to be introduced only in non-residential areas. That is another example of a rat-runner's charter. It is the antithesis of what we want the mayor to introduce. As for residents, it will be open for the mayor to create exemptions. I refer now to amendment (j). I do not share the hon. Gentleman's pessimism that the only effective scheme will be an electronic one. However, I take on board his point about the number of years that will be afforded should it be necessary to borrow from the general fund. I am willing to take away that proposal and consider whether we have afforded sufficient time. In the light of that, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not press that amendment to a Division.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
Amendments (aa) and (bb) deal with who would be exempted from charges. The hon. Gentleman touched on the obvious exemption that covers people with disabilities, orange badge holders, emergency vehicles and whether the mayor would make exemptions if public transport is involved in industrial action. It will be up to the mayor to decide such issues. It would be improper to include such details in the Bill. We have made it abundantly clear that the mayor will be required to consult. The boroughs will also be required to consult. However, fine details must be left to the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most interesting information to come out of this afternoon's exchanges is that the Conservative party is totally opposed to introducing congestion charging in London, although such charging will be policy outside London. The hon. Member for Croydon, South gave no indication whether Conservative policy in this area would include hypothecation, which the Government have introduced. In an exchange between the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, the point was made that the majority of old bangers are to be found in London. That is one of the strongest arguments for the sort of schemes that the mayor will introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me point out to the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman that 40 per cent, of Londoners have no access to private transport, and are entirely dependent on public transport. Of course, a strand in the mayor's strategy in this area will be to reduce congestion and raise revenue to improve public transport, thereby facilitating speedier travel by public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At what level should a charge be set before it effectively reduces congestion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be a decision for the mayor to make in the light of relevant information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister think is the level at which a charge should be set?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to know that, without examining the information presently available and that which will be available to the mayor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister is not in a position to know, as the research is not back yet. However, does she think that the charge should be set at a level that would effectively deter a substantial number of motorists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter will be entirely dependent on the desired outcomes on which the mayor will decide. He will do that after resolving a strategy that will deliver the kind of integrated transport that London wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about the matter of principle to which the hon. Gentleman refers. Perhaps he can help me out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the matter is for the mayor. I am asking whether the charge should be set at a level that would deter motorists from entering the designated area. That is pretty straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For met to give an informed response presupposes that I would know the designated area to which the hon. Gentleman is referring. It also presupposes that I would know how much motorists are prepared to pay for the privilege of driving in and out of an area. That is a matter for the mayor to decide when delivering an integrated transport strategy for London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, it would be absurd to presuppose that anyone has the kind of information referred to by the hon. Gentleman, which is necessary to make an informed response. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am delighted that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood has chosen to rejoin the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South said that voters will decide on the mayoral decision on transport, painting a bleak picture for mayoral candidates on such matters. The Bill's proposals are already well known in London, and Londoners have given them a strong endorsement. Sorting out London's transport is Londoners' highest priority. They have consistently argued that the only way to sort the matter out is to have a body creating a plan to deliver such a strategy. They also believe that there must be a dedicated income stream to bring about the necessary improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was concerned about additional powers to be vested in the mayor in relation to residents having to pay for the privilege of keeping their cars on the road. Many Londoners currently experience that in relation to residential parking schemes. These powers are with the boroughs. My constituents are agitating for such schemes to be introduced into their areas because of the benefits that they undoubtedly bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to a rat-runners charter. It is to avoid rat running that the sort of strategy that the mayor will introduce is needed. He was also concerned that the introduction of new charges would distort the economy in London but congestion is already doing that. It is, with the exception of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a scheme that is warmly welcomed and endorsed by business in London and is strongly endorsed by Westminster council. In a press release issued on 25 November 1998, the council said that it would consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"the feasibility of various forms of congestion charging"</p></blockquote>
as an aid to reducing central London Traffic levels and emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the hon. Gentleman is in a somewhat solitary state, apart from other Conservative Members, in finding such charging a less than attractive idea. As it will be Conservative party policy to introduce such charges outside London, will he support his party in that area? In conclusion,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1119</span>
Londoners have endorsed not only the policy of a strong mayor and a scrutinising assembly but the radical and innovative proposal brought forward by this Government. I therefore commend the new schedule to the Committee and ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that she heard a filibuster after dinner. I heard three 10-minute speeches that were short and succinct and took not a fraction of the time that she spent introducing the clauses. I should also like to sort out the matter of the Business Sub-Committee. I recall that last Thursday we reached the end of clause 199 at about 4.40 pm. The Committee then adjourned and the Business Sub-Committee met to discuss the conduct of today's business. That was the only thing that was agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was attempting to make was that our procedures this evening were agreed by all members of the Committee, including the Opposition parties. Nothing has been imposed on Opposition parties. It is something that they requested and endorsed. If they have chosen to waste their time, that is their choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was that made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster. There was no reason why we should not have gone on to clause 200 on Thursday evening. No request was made from this party to stop at 4.40 pm on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will recall that the issue of the time available to consider the new clauses and schedules that we have been considering today was raised early in our proceedings on Thursday by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. In response to his request, the Chairman gave an undertaking that the Business Sub-Committee would convene after we completed our business. It was on the understanding that, as a result of reconvening the Business Sub-Committee, there would be more time to consider the transport clauses, we concluded the previous parts of the Bill and adjourned when we did on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister checks the records he may find that it may have been the position of the Liberal party but it was not the position of the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the position of the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may have been the position of the Chairman; it still is not the position of the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are embarrassed by your Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not embarrassed by my Whip. I know exactly what he agreed to and I am talking about the proceedings before that Sub-Committee met, not what was agreed at it. I do not quarrel about what was agreed there about today's procedures. That was right and proper. What I query is the decision to stop at 4.40 pm on Thursday.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>1120</span>
Whip is getting pretty bolshie about this. The Minister referred to the record. He can read it if he wants to, but he will find that there is no record of the Opposition agreeing to stop the Committee at 4.40 pm on Thursday. It is as simple and straightforward as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
