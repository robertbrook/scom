</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three new clauses relate to matters which arose in the Macpherson report following the Lawrence inquiry; it is therefore entirely relevant that they are being taken together. The first new clause is self-explanatory, and relates specifically to one aspect of performance indicators. The Macpherson report recommended that the exact words used in the new clause should be included as ministerial policy for all police services. Chapter 47 of the report, in a section entitled, "Openness, accountability and the restoration of confidence", recommends:
	<br><q><p>"The process of implementing, monitoring and assessing the Ministerial Priority should include Performance Indicators in relation to"—</p></q>
the items set out in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not expand at length on why it is important at this time in the history of the Met and at the beginning of the life of the MPA to set out such objectives. Self-evidently, the MPA needs to get off to a good start. It needs to command the confidence of all the communities in London. Many Committee members, more than most hon. Members in other parts of the country, represent mixed-race communities and are very conscious of the fact that one in five people in London is of black, Asian or other ethnic minority origin. In my constituency, one quarter of my electorate are black, Asian, Chinese or from other ethnic minorities. For them, one of the tests of the new authority will be how it will responds to the failures that were identified by the Lawrence report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was mentioned earlier that by the work that we have already done to incorporate amendments into existing police legislation, we have in fact already provided for some targets to be part of the Met's work. There are performance indicators in existing legislation; they are laid down as an obligation of police authorities. We talked earlier—in a more confrontational manner, I admit—about the staffing and funding of the Met. One test that we discussed was efficient and effective policing. Existing legislation lays down various indicators by which that is to be judged. Performance indicators are now accepted as a means of judging that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, there are no formally agreed police indicators. There are Audit Commission indicators, which are used generally to ensure that the police service does its job well, and the inspectorate of constabulary has indicators, but Ministers may respond to the debate by telling us how specific and independently tested performance indicators could be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons why these matters are important speak for themselves, but one test as to how satisfactory the police are is whether, as the new clause states in paragraph (2)(e), there are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1287</span>
	<br><q><p>"equal satisfaction levels across all ethnic groups in public satisfaction surveys".</p></q>
I compliment the Met on what it has done in recent years to ensure that it tries to respond to the concerns that have been expressed. To be fair, it was responding to those concerns before the Lawrence inquiry reported, but I have every confidence that the inquiry will push the Met further in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the new clause contains a verbatim quote from the Lawrence recommendations, it relates specifically to racial prejudice and disadvantage and fairness in a racial context. However, there is one other context in which it would be inappropriate not to mention fairness—the Met should also have targets and indicators on homophobic violence. That has been accepted in principle; perhaps the Minister could say how it can be incorporated in a second set of tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as a police community consultative group, Southwark has a forum in which matters of prejudice, policing and security are raised. It is very effective and allows gay and lesbian people in Southwark to express their views and concerns, which they find very valuable. Until recently, people felt that if they were members of any of those categories, they did not get equal service from the police. That has changed considerably and I think that the police want matters to continue moving in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 70 raises a more immediate issue of greater concern and again draws directly on the Lawrence inquiry recommendations. It proposes that the Metropolitan police authority should report to the mayor and assembly on the recruitment of ethnic minority staff in both its civilian and uniformed sections—to pick up the point of the hon. Member for Ilford, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Met has been working hard to increase the number of ethnic minority recruits. Given that one in five Londoners are from ethnic minorities, it should try to be a force that represents those communities, although I do not believe in having artificial targets and allocating places; that is the wrong way to proceed. From the most recent information I have, which comes from House of Commons answers given last June, of the 26,192 serving officers in the Met at that time, 3.3 per cent. or 861 officers came from the ethnic minorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in today's paper that the Met is concerned to ensure that it helps black and Asian officers to rise to the senior ranks. From memory, there are something like 18 or 20-odd senior officers of inspector rank, superintendent rank and above—we have one in Southwark—but so far few have risen as high as that. There is only one deputy Commissioner from the ethnic minorities. He is Asian by background and I think that he is in Leicestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, the Met is already above the national average, which is 2 per cent. of officers from ethnic minorities. However, one or two places are above the Met, including Bedfordshire—good work must have been done there, because its ethnic minority numbers are not as high as in London—Leicestershire with 4.5 per cent. and the West Midlands with 4.1 per cent. But we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1288</span>
are a long way off the sort of numbers that we need to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will give some indication of their support for that. Certainly the Met's senior officers keenly want young black and Asian officers to join them. I said earlier that the ideal recruit in terms of the balance of the Met force would be a Londoner who is a graduate and from one of the minority communities. We must collectively do all that we can to encourage the MPA to recruit such people. We need to be imaginative about that. The Met has suggested a form of mentoring leading to fellowships or scholarships, which is a good idea, and I mentioned earlier the idea that I have been exploring with London First.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 71 deals with the reporting of crimes. It suggests that the MPA should propose methods to encourage the reporting of incidents and crimes, including those of a racist nature, after consulting the mayor and assembly. I do not pretend that it is an original suggestion—it is a direct crib from the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry. It was tabled to give the Government a chance to make an early response in this area, which I am sure that they will not find difficult in the light of the recommendations of Sir William Macpherson and his advisers. I hope that the Government will say that the measure will be included when it is appropriate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful in one respect about the implementation of the Lawrence report. As we begin to eliminate racism, as far as is possible, from individual officers and the police as a whole, so that black and Asian citizens in London can have every confidence in the police, we must ensure that measures are not taken that lead to the white community losing confidence in the police. It is a delicate balance, but we must achieve it. At the end of the exercise, when London's police have been inspected by an inspectorate, everyone must feel more confident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. After the Lawrence inquiry, the police undertook an investigation, which has now ended, into the death of an 18-year-old white youngster, Robert Radford, in Walworth in my constituency. Someone has now been arrested and charged with manslaughter in connection with his death. The officers who dealt with the case were, like those who dealt with the Lawrence case, south-east London senior detectives. It was easy for the parents of Robert Radford to feel that all the attention was being devoted to crimes with a racial element—those with a black or Asian victim. I had to spend quite some time reassuring them that that was not the case, and should not be the case. As we build up the confidence of families such as the Lawrences and others from minority communities, it is important to ensure that we build up the Met's ability to respond to all crime in London. It would be no good winning the confidence of those with less confidence if that of those who had more was lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we allow the Met to concentrate on the crimes and activities that are important to Londoners—by definition, murders, homicides, manslaughters and violent crimes are at the top end of the scale—we will do all our fellow-citizens a service. I hope that, in non-confrontational tones, I have persuaded the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1289</span>
Government to be sympathetic to the new clauses and that they can take them on board, thus giving the first positive response to the Macpherson inquiry recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the hour. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has been brief and I shall be even more so. I shall explain the official Opposition's view on the new clauses. I naturally understand his motivation in tabling them, and the Committee should be grateful to him for having done so. At the beginning of today's proceedings—which now seems a very long time ago—I said that the official Opposition are powerfully motivated in these matters by the view of Stephen Lawrence's father that the one thing that must be done at this stage is to restore the confidence of the black community in the police. That should be our guiding spirit. I am not decrying the motivation of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in proposing the new clauses. It seems to us, however, that they are premature. They press the Government to react—and they may be prepared to do so—but, given the seriousness of the matters to which the new clauses relate, it seems to us better that the Home Secretary should give a considered response as and when we have an opportunity for appropriate debate. We should not rush into that debate now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I have referred in the Committee to the only occasion on which the Government were defeated during the war. The defeat occurred on an amendment for which my father voted. It was proposed that the Education Bill considered in 1944 be amended to ensure that after the war all female teachers would receive equal pay to that of male teachers. The Government were defeated by one vote. Churchill made the matter a vote of confidence on Report, and won by 425 votes to 17, or thereabouts. He sent for David Eccles, a great man who died the other day, who had moved the amendment within a year of coming into the House. Churchill said, "Young man, I totally agree with the proposition that you were advancing in that amendment, but to put an amendment of that magnitude into the Committee stage of the Education Bill is like putting an elephant into a perambulator". The matter was then discarded. I do not quote that example to mock the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but I think that it is premature to raise the issues that he raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 69 deals with matters that relate to section 6 of the Police Act 1996, which is cited in clause 208. The Act states that for good policing, attention should paid to the Secretary of State's objectives, to the police authority's objectives—the Metropolitan police authority in this instance—and to the performance targets that it establishes. Those are all matters for which we should wait, and they are already dealt with in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new clause 70, I should point out that there is, of course, interest in what the Government and the Home Secretary will do. Again, however, it seems premature to suggest that the Government should come forward now. Any targets for recruitment of ethnic employees in the Metropolitan police must be seen in the context of overall targets for police manpower. The Minister could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1290</span>
tease the official Opposition by saying that we took away the principle of a complement. I do not think, however, that anyone would want to return to the previous approach. We stand in need of help, but we are prepared to wait for the Government to decide what they want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, new clause 71 incorporates a Macpherson recommendation. The wording of the recommendation suggests that it is operational as far as the police are concerned. It should not, therefore, be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all to some extent prisoners of our background and political experience. I spent my formative years in the city of Bradford, and my constituency has the biggest concentration of Pakistanis in Britain. That has made a deep impression on me. One fact that has lingered with me to this day is that people who preach loudest and longest about the evils of racism very often do their cause a disservice. The best way of promoting harmony is leadership by example. All the new clause could be subsumed in the phrase of proposed subsection (2) that states:
	<br><q><p>"The objectives under subsection (i) above shall include the overall aim of … the demonstration of fairness".</p></q>
There is far too much bandying about of the ill-defined adjective "racist". In most instances, "racial" would be more appropriate. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster pointed out, these are not matters to be included in the Bill. They are reactions to a particular tragedy that has lessons for policing in London. I cannot say that my right hon. Friend's analogy about the elephant and the perambulator is the one that I would have chosen, but it is historically a graphic one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Greater London Authority Bill contains provisions for the Metropolitan police authority that we hope will stand the test of time. It should not have prescriptive provisions written into it, such as those proposed in new clauses 69, 70 and 71. Its phraseology should be genuinely classic inasmuch as it will be valid for ever and aye. I do not believe that an obsession with the evils of racism, dire as they are at present, produces the kind of balanced legislation that we are seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully sympathise with the inspiration behind the three new clauses: it is entirely laudable. But I do not think that they are appropriate from the point of view of passing legislation. I hope that Her Majesty's Government will therefore not accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey moved the new clause made it clear that the proposals arise out of a genuine desire to come to terms with the Macpherson report, and to deal with some of the very grave issues that it raises. Although the new clauses are laudable, and the Government would have no problem in accepting the spirit of them, we must get back to debating what is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, there will be a full day's debate on the wider aspects of the Macpherson report before Easter. Everyone will be able to give their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1291</span>
views and suggestions on how we move forward. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will explain the Government's position on some of the recommendations arising out of the Macpherson report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses would oblige the Metropolitan police authority to take a variety of anti-racist measures. We agree with all of them, but do not believe that this is the appropriate time and place to include them in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to new clause 89—no, I mean 69. May I say a brief word of thanks, by the way, to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster? He had the misfortune this morning to lose his car with his papers in it. I had the misfortune to lose my glasses over dinner, and I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for lending me his. So I did not mean to say new clause 89.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 69 would oblige the Metropolitan police authority to set objectives for the Metropolitan police service and 10 performance indicators in support of a specific objective to eliminate racist prejudice within the Met police and to demonstrate fairness in all aspects of policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under new clause 70, the MPA would set annual targets for the recruitment, progression and retention of minority ethnic staff, and report annually on the matter to the mayor and assembly. Under new clause 71, the MPA would bring forward proposals on methods of encouraging the reporting of incidents and crimes, including racist incidents and crimes, after consulting the mayor and assembly. Those are all laudable proposals, as has already been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the new clauses are of course related to recommendations 2, 64 and 16 respectively of the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The Macpherson report recommendations are directed at the police service nationally. Indeed, the Government already have work in hand to give effect to all three recommendations nationally; they were not directed solely at the Metropolitan police. The measures should be in place before 3 July 2000, and will therefore apply to the Metropolitan police before the establishment of the Metropolitan police authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that it is better to take forward the recommendations as part of a national response than to adopt the approach of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey of amending this Bill, which affects policing in London only. Throughout consideration of the Bill, our approach has been that the MPA should be brought into line with police authorities outside London, as far as possible. In that context, it would appear strange to introduce a series of measures that would apply only to the MPA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the argument that while the Bill is before us, we should take the opportunity to press ahead in London, and allow the rest of the country to catch up with us when a legislative slot becomes available. However, the measures that we are taking will apply to the MPA
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1292</span>
and to the Metropolitan police service more effectively than would those proposed in the new three new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 69 arose from recommendation 2 of the Macpherson report. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has announced that he will use his powers under the Police Act 1996 to ensure that every police authority sets clear objectives to improve its response to racist crime and to establish effective ways of demonstrating fairness in all aspects of policing. The Home Secretary has powers under section 37 of the 1996 Act to fix objectives for police authorities, and to set performance targets to meet those objectives. Authorities must have regard to those objectives—known as ministerial priorities—and reflect them in their local policing objectives and local policing plans. Chief constables are obliged to have regard to those plans in exercising their functions. All those provisions of the 1996 Act are applied to the metropolitan police by schedule 17 to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We aim to have in place a formal ministerial priority and targets by 2000–01, which, as I said, will predate the establishment of the MPA. Before we decide on the targets to support the ministerial priority, we will consult further, notably with ethnic minority communities themselves, and with police forces and authorities. The 10 targets in the new clause may not be the best ones to use. I notice that many of them are not targeted on outcomes. We think that it is right to spend some time ensuring that appropriate targets are set, and we also believe that it is better to set them in subordinate legislation, as that offers more flexibility to respond to future changes than is provided by primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 70, which relates to recommendation 64, proposes that the MPA should report to the mayor and assembly. Once again, the Government are already acting nationally in that regard. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has announced our plans to ensure that every police force reflects the ethnic diversity of the communities that it serves. He will chair a national conference of all chief constables and police authorities on the issue in April. The conference will consider how we can dismantle barriers, and will address issues such as personnel practices within forces, managing targets, how ethnic minority officers can influence policy, and so on. In particular, it will consider recruitment and retention of Asian and black officers in the force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 70 would require the MPA to report annually to the mayor and assembly on its progress in meeting the specified targets. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will be aware that the Bill as drafted already gives the assembly power to question the MPA on the discharge of its functions—that is provided by paragraph 73 of schedule 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirmed that the Home Secretary would be speaking at a conference next month that will address these matters. Will he also give the conclusions of his thinking on targets on that occasion? I understand that he said last year that he would set targets, but that he wanted time to think. Are we to expect them next month, or will they be announced by the Home Office on another date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Macpherson inquiry's recommendation is narrower in its focus—it deals with racist incidents and crimes only—than new clause 71, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The recommendation puts the onus on police forces to take all possible steps at a local level to encourage reporting, in consultation with local government and other agencies. The suggestion that the Metropolitan police authority should be responsible for bringing together agencies and producing proposals is misguided. These are operational matters, as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster pointed out, and it is right that local operational commanders should be in the lead, as the Macpherson team recommends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fully accept the need for a co-ordinated response to racist incidents and crimes and we also agree that there is a need for flexibility in reporting arrangements. An effective multi-agency approach to racist incidents is being promoted by the racial incidents standing committee, which my Department chairs and on which all relevant departments and agencies, including the police and the Commission for Racial Equality, are represented. The committee produced a very good practice guide in October 1998 called "In This Together", which encourages effective multi-agency working at the local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey acknowledged a number of the initiatives that the Met has taken recently. In particular, there is the establishment of the racial and violent crime task force. Since last September, the reporting of racially motivated crime has risen by 68 per cent. across the Met and by 146 per cent. in 2 Area, where officers have issued racial incident advice cards. In addition, the Met has launched a diversity strategy and a three-year programme of further action as part of the drive to build an anti-racist police service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Committee members will know, there will be a debate at the end of this month on the response to the Macpherson report and the Government's proposals for taking forward the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those points, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause. I assure him that the Government are determined to work with the police in ensuring that the police service throughout the country, especially in the Met, is representative of the community that it serves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, not just for the way in which the Minister responded but also for what she said. I would not argue that the Met should have a different standard from other police services. That is a good point. We need to ensure that all our police forces across the country have a common—and a commonly high—standard. Therefore, although this is an opportunity to legislate, I heard the Minister's perfectly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1294</span>
reasonable reassurance that the Government are minded to ensure that by some date next year, the same standards will apply. I also take on board the fact that it is better to put criteria for targets in secondary legislation because it is easier to amend that than to amend an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the hon. Lady in complimenting the police, particularly on what they have done recently. Some time ago, I received the first of the Met's policing diversity publications. I know that the new task force under Deputy Assistant Commissioner Grieve has prioritised that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall accept the Minister's suggestion not to pursue the new clause today—I am happy for the Committee to leave it on one side as a check list to come back to later. Before I do that, however, I note that my colleagues and I, and possibly other hon. Members, received the report of the Metropolitan police services ethnic minority working group on recruitment and advancement. That has some good suggestions which, if implemented, would deliver much of the recruitment progress that we all want to see. There is a wide desire in the Committee for consensus on the matter. I appreciate the points that were made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. It is no good having things in writing if they are not delivered in practice, and the best examples are provided by role models. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>"The Assembly and Mayor shall give guidance to the MPA on the number of police officers necessary to fulfil the duties of the Metropolitan Police Service.".—	<i>[Mr. Simon Hughes.]</i></p>
	<p>This is a one new clause debate rather than a three new clause debate, and the new clause does not arise from the Macpherson report. It would require the assembly and the mayor to give guidance to the MPA on the number of police officers that is necessary to fulfil the duties of the Metropolitan police service.</p>
	<p>The Library has given me a table of the numbers of officers in the Met police for each of the last 20 years. That shows that in 1978, the table's starting point, the Met had 21,961 officers. After that, the number rose consistently with almost no variation—although it dropped off a little in 1985—to a peak of 28,176 officers in 1989.</p>

I believe that I heard the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood suggest that we should give thanks to Baroness Thatcher, who was Prime Minister at the time that the Met had more officers than at any other time in its history. I acknowledge that fact, and pay tribute to the Administration of the time for achieving that record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, the number of officers has fallen consistently so that the figure for the most recent year is down to 26,106. That is a decline of 7 per cent. since 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has happened to crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks what has happened to crime. Of course, the test of the police should be how effective it is rather than how many officers there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister chided me earlier for being selective in my use of statistics. I was not selective in the statistics that I took from the latest Audit Commission report. Those were the statistics that it contained, and it is the very latest report—it was published in January this year. There are, of course, other statistics, covering my area of Southwark and others, that show that the Met police has had considerable success in reducing crime levels. That trend also started before the change in Government and has carried over to the current Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that people in London would not want a police service without police officers—a service that was invisible, with no police on the streets, in shopping centres, at football matches, at demonstrations or on estates. On Sunday, I was in Surrey Docks in my constituency. A point was volunteered to me—not solicited by me—about police not being seen. The issue matters to people, and there is a minimum sufficient standard of police at which we should aim. I do not have a formula, but I know that the Government have concocted for the MPA a regime in which they can cap its budget on the one hand and determine its bottom expenditure level on the other. They have taken on themselves responsibility of deciding spending parameters for the MPA. If the Government are to adopt that approach and stipulate a minimum amount of money, it is reasonable to suggest that police numbers should not drop below a specific absolute number, fall in relative terms such as the numbers per thousand people, or decrease in respect of criteria linked to performance and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as recognising the need for more efficient policing, do the Government accept that it is wrong to go on reducing police numbers in London? I hope that the Minister will not tell the Committee that debate on this subject is inappropriate, because the matter is dealt with in the new clause. Will the Government confirm that it is their policy to ensure that numbers of police officers in London will start to climb again, that the decline of the past few years is reversed and that all parts of London that have seen a decline will start to see the establishment figures complemented if recruitment allows? The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department referred to that point earlier, and the list bears out that decline has occurred in almost every division in London. Will police numbers in the Met
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1296</span>
begin to be the numbers that the public want? I hope that that is possible, and that the spirit of new clause will find favour, if not its wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be even briefer than I was in the previous debate, not least because the Committee is considering only one clause. I expressed my views on the principle of recruitment while commenting on new clause 70. I said that targets of ethnic recruitment should be seen in the context of overall police manpower targets, and expressed the hope that the Government would advance that cause after due reflection. I continue to hold that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I missed the intervention made on the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey this morning by my Parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, although I caught the end of her remarks. I am familiar with the circumstances in Paddington green, which she and I share in our constituencies, and I wholly understood her points, as I perceived them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that across London there is a sense of being short staffed and of the implications. I am content, however, to hear what the Home Office and Home Secretary have to say before writing into the Bill obligations such as those proposed for the mayor and assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey really thinks that the new clause could be agreed to. He expressed his hope that the Government might accept its spirit, if I remember correctly, but I do not think that we can do even that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would oblige the assembly and mayor to give guidance to the MPA on the number of police officers required by the Metropolitan police force to do its job. I cannot understand how the hon. Gentleman does not think that that proposal is misguided. It will not be within the power of the MPA to decide an the number of officers in the Metropolitan police. The number of officers is an operational matter, which, since the Police and Magistrates Courts Act 1994 took effect, has been the responsibility of chief officers in the areas concerned—in the case of the Bill the Commissioner. The number of police officers in the Metropolitan police will remain a matter for the Commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could talk about police numbers, but I genuinely believe that such a debate would be sterile. Thinking has moved on. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said, when we were in Opposition, we were probably misguided in continually referring to numbers. A recent Audit Commission report said that increases in the number of police officers do not necessarily lead to a reduction in crime, and we have police in order to help reduce crime. The Government are focusing on outcomes—that is what the real debate should be about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures quoted by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey were slightly outdated. They came from the recent Audit Commission report, but go back to last year, and were based on the previous year's findings. There was a slight increase of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1297</span>
13 in the number of police officers in the Metropolitan police in the first six months of the financial year. That gives a total of 26,103 officers. Under the force's budget for 1999–2000, the plan is to have 26,400 officers in place by the end of March 2000. That would be 287 more than in September 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening very carefully to the debate. I share the Minister's view that we should not accept the new clause. It is not just a question of recruiting officers to the Metropolitan police force, but of keeping them there. So many of them take early retirement or transfer to other police forces, and that is a real problem. It is almost as if many policemen want to get out of London and go to a sleepier Somerset town, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new clause were incorporated into the Bill, we would have to, in all fairness, give draconian powers to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner to prevent officers from transferring to another police force or to limit severely the numbers of people who would, on otherwise good grounds, need to retire early.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point in his usual amiable way, and there is something in what he says. We want police officers to stay in the Met. That is at the forefront of all the recruitment and retention measures that we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to the point about the Government being keen to see outcomes and not getting bogged down in numbers. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 obliges and makes it statutory for local authorities and the police to publish crime prevention and reduction strategies for each area, and to report annually on progress against targets. Police performance indicators are increasingly outcome-based. Police officer numbers are an input measure. In addition, we have asked police forces to make year-on-year efficiency savings of 2 per cent. to enable more resources to be devoted to front-line policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Metropolitan police force has put in place a huge programme of attendance management, which has resulted in a significant fall in levels of sickness. In the eight months to November 1998, the number of days absent through sickness was down by 22.5 per cent. on the same period in 1997. By any measure, that was a successful management move. It represents the equivalent of an additional 285 officers for operational duties, or a financial saving of £10.8 million. The force's target for 1999–2000 is to reduce sickness so as to release a further 200 officers for operational duties. That is why the Metropolitan police and all police forces should be continually pressed to ensure that they make best use of their resources. We want efficiency savings of 2 per cent. to enable more resources to be devoted to front-line policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the record, the Metropolitan police has a higher ratio of police officers per head of population than any force outside London. There is one officer for every 292 people in the Metropolitan police district, compared with an average national figure of 1 officer for every 420
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1298</span>
people. If you check policing levels in your Macclesfield constituency, Mr. Winterton, I am sure that you will agree that policing levels in the Metropolitan district are very high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, the Under-Secretary should add that there are more police officers per head of population in London because they have to perform duties relating to diplomatic protection, international crime fighting, international drug trafficking, and so on. Of course, it is not merely a question of resignations but of recruitment. However, regardless of the number of police officers in the capital, it is essential for the confidence of Londoners that sufficient officers are assigned to what is traditionally called the "bobby on the beat" job. If the figures showed the number of officers assigned to special branch, diplomatic and royal protection, international crime fighting, and so on, they would be more meaningful but perhaps less comforting to the people of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I should say that some of the special activities of the Metropolitan police, such as policing terrorism, help to keep safe the people of London. If one were to work it out, the figures would show that the Metropolitan police already has a good policing ratio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to confidence. Of course, the confidence of the police force is related to crime levels. Although the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was referring this morning to the Audit Commission report, he did so rather selectively. We must remember that reported crime in London is now at its lowest level for nine years. The latest statistics show that recorded crime in London continues to fall: in 1998, burglaries declined by 10.3 per cent. and street crime by 7.8 per cent., compared with 1997. The 1998 British crime survey showed the first overall drop in crime since the survey began in 1981. Significantly, the survey of public attitudes confirmed that the number of Londoners who reported that they were not victims of crime during the past 12 months rose from 72 per cent. in 1997 to 77 per cent. in 1998. I could quote many more such statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing statistics, it is easy to say that money and resources are the answer to everything. Clearly, money is important, but it is not the only factor that determines an efficient and responsible police force. We have resolved to consider all the factors, rather than concentrating on one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor will have a major role in financial matters and will be responsible for setting the budget for the Metropolitan police authority. The assembly will also play a part in such matters, in that it will be empowered to amend the mayor's proposed budget through a two-thirds majority. In respect of resource allocation decisions, the Commissioner will be democratically accountable to the MPA, which must approve the policing plan for the Metropolitan district. A majority—12—of MPA members, will be assembly members appointed by the mayor, one of whom will be appointed deputy mayor. Excepting the role of mayor, this practice conforms to that which prevails throughout the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1299</span>
The wording of the new clause is exceedingly vague. As it stands, the MPA could ignore guidance set by the assembly and mayor; nor is it clear how often the guidance should be provided. Will it change every six months or each time that new crime statistics are released? Will there be one set of guidance for the assembly and the mayor jointly, or two sets—one for each body? The amendment would oblige the assembly and the mayor to give guidance on matters about which they may have no specialist knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey tabled the new clause. It gave us an opportunity to discuss aspects of policing that fall outside the Bill's framework. On reflection, however, I hope that he will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To save you from doing what might over-elaborately be called research, Mr. Winterton, the figure for Cheshire is just below the average—it has 2.2 officers per 1,000 people. The Metropolitan police are at the top of the list. I shall show you the table later, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister did not say so, this is, in effect, a probing new clause. It suggests that it would be inappropriate for the Metropolitan police authority to take the relevant decisions. The new clause refers to the mayor and to the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's position. In relation to the police, I have never argued that numbers are everything. Many countries have large police forces, but they do not necessarily deliver the goods. When I was in Paris in January, I noticed that police officers roamed around in packs of five. They may have added to the security on the metro, but I am not convinced that they did much good in relation to the delivery of product efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, I welcome the fact that the numbers have crept up and that the target will raise them further. The Minister for Transport in London made much play, when the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats were in Opposition before the last election, of the decline in numbers. Perhaps we all need to be a little more sophisticated than we were previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's valid point about sickness. A real problem that police forces face involves the number of people who are on the books and who are being paid but who are not available for work. Some of them appear to be absent for periods that cannot be justified by any obvious, objective test. However, I do not suggest that the many officers who have worked in traumatic situations do not suffer trauma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the Lawrence inquiry, sometimes it is easy to have a go at the police. However, it was pointed out—I believe by the Commissioner—that the two off-duty officers, who were the first people to find Stephen Lawrence on their way back from church and who stayed with him until the ambulance arrived, have suffered thus far unremedied trauma that has left them unable to work in any capacity, not least because of their crossexamination at the inquiry, which was entirely unsympathetic to the needs of people who act voluntarily
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1300</span>
when off duty. We should remember that police officers and fire officers often voluntarily go into dangerous situations and that most of us would not willingly volunteer to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is not simplistic and requires sensitive handling. The Minister's reply was reasonable. We want an efficient police force that is adequately staffed and we want the relevant numbers to be met. There should be enough good people available to do the job that needs to be done. Under its new regime, we also want the MPA to have the resources that it believes it needs to do the job. I hope that democratic accountability will increase those resources and that the Government will, in time, lift the remaining limits and controls.

This debate may be our only opportunity to discuss the consequences for London government of the current administration of the river. Ten years ago this summer, in the early hours of the morning, I was woken by a phone call. I was told that a boat was sinking in the Thames, not far from my home, and I went to the river to meet the police and rescue services. The Committee and the country know what happened that night—51 people died when the Marchioness sank, and their average age was 25. A couple of years later, the Deputy Prime Minister—who was then shadow Transport spokesman for the Labour Opposition—wrote a letter to 	<i>The Times,</i> of which the Minister is aware from previous meetings with myself and others on this matter. That letter stated:
	<br><q><p>"The response … by Mr Edmund Lawson, QC, to my charge that 'fancy dancing by lawyers' has prevented justice 'being aired in a public enquiry' into the Marchioness disaster in no way alters my view that the present system governing such matters is a total mess and requires urgent reform. I fully endorse Mr Michael Napier's call, in the same issue, for a full public enquiry."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell the Government Whip that his conversation is almost louder than the hon. Gentleman's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That letter was written in the summer of 1991. It is now 1999, and no public inquiry has been held. The survivors of the Marchioness and their families still feel greatly aggrieved. Many of us with an interest in the river feel that the public have been badly served. I do not want to be confrontational on this point, but I hope that on the 10th anniversary of the disaster the Minister for Transport in London and the Secretary of State will honour the Government's only remaining undertaking to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1301</span>
hold a public inquiry. It was agreed that there would be a Hillsborough inquiry, and it happened. In opposition, the Home Secretary agreed to an inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence, and that has happened. The remaining item of the trilogy is an inquiry into the Marchioness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a meeting in the House some months ago—which was called by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond)—it transpired that nobody has clear responsibility for safety and security on the river. Representatives of the Port of London Authority and the Metropolitan police attended the meeting, and they disagreed on which of them had responsibility for river safety. The Met said that it took bodies out of the river as a matter of practice, and that although it conducted the search and rescue operation, it was not the responsible authority. The PLA also said that it was not responsible. Nobody else has claimed the responsibility—the only other possible candidate would be the London fire and civil defence authority.

The new clause is tabled to probe the way in which responsibility for the river will be managed within the boundaries of Greater London, from the date when the Greater London Authority comes into existence next year. The Metropolitan police authority should be the responsible lead authority. I will understand if the Minister believes that it should be another body. It will be unacceptable, however, if by the time we conclude our proceedings on the Bill, there is still nobody with responsibility for the safety and security of people on or in the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an unacceptable gap in the legislation. Somebody must have the lead responsibility in law. The least that we can do, pending what I hope will be the imminent announcement of the much sought-after public inquiry, is to remedy this failure. Those who attended any of the inquests into the sinking of the Marchioness, those who read the report of the marine accident investigation branch and those who talked to the families involved know that there was at least some confusion on the night that the Marchioness sank. Those matters have not been put right in terms of the management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will enable us as a Committee and a Parliament to resolve the question that remains unanswered of who is in charge of river safety. Is it the Metropolitan police or somebody else? I hope that the Minister can tell us how the Government intend to proceed and that the matter can be enshrined in law so that there is never again a vacuum in public and political responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one who lives in London will be able to forget that appalling night when such a terrible tragedy struck so many young people on the river, because we see the river every day. Sometimes we almost forget that it is there and forget that it can, like all large stretches of water, and certainly tidal waterways, on occasions take the most terrible toll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was right to refer to what my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said at the time. The hon. Gentleman has been helpful, certainly in my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1302</span>
meetings with the Marchioness action group, and in attempting to persuade the members of the action group to furnish the names and addresses of witnesses who they claim have evidence about the tragedy that has never been heard. Both I and my Department have also heard of such evidence, both directly and via the solicitor who acts for the MAG. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman joins me in regretting that he and I have been markedly unsuccessful: as yet, no such names or addresses have been forwarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman's case is not as bleak as he leads the Committee to believe. Lessons were learnt after the Marchioness tragedy. It is regrettable but true that many major advances in safety in the workplace, on various modes of transport and across a range of human activities, have been made on the back of an appalling human tragedy. The first question that we ask when such a tragedy strikes is why. It often seems remarkable that such a tragedy could occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be irresponsible of me not to point out the changes that have been made. The hon. Gentleman referred to the need, as he perceived it, for one overarching control for the River Thames when a tragedy strikes. He spoke of the confusion that occurred on the night of the Marchioness tragedy. Surely confusion would have been inevitable, even if a different system had been in operation on that night. The sights and sounds would have caused even the most hardened people terrible anguish and confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to search and rescue facilities on the river, the London emergency services liaison panel has published procedures for dealing with major incidents, confirming the role of the police as co-ordinators of the emergency response. The river users liaison safety sub-committee has also completed a review of the craft available for rescue throughout the tidal Thames. My Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency has approved Metropolitan police training courses for dealing with emergencies using boats. Moreover, in 1996, the Port of London authority undertook a fundamental review of its emergency response procedures. Following that review, a memorandum of understanding between the Port of London authority and the Metropolitan police Thames division was signed in December 1996, and a similar memorandum of understanding between the Port of London authority and Her Majesty's coastguard was signed in January 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no way do I wish to dismiss the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has put to the Committee because they are issues of great and grave importance, but I have detailed the improvements that have been made in relation to safely and security on the river Thames in the light of accident or disaster. In essence, the new clause would provide that the overarching responsibility for safety and security of
	<br><q><p>"all on or in the River Thames"</p></q>
should rest with the Metropolitan police authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policing of the river is an operational matter and falls to the Metropolitan police service; it would not be appropriate to give the Metropolitan police authority responsibility for operational matters. Yet the amendment would go even further, giving the MPA a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1303</span>
general responsibility for safety and security on the river. It would lead to a situation in which the MPA was responsible for ensuring that the fabric of jetties was safe, and that vessels on the river obeyed rules of navigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, policing is currently carried out by the Metropolitan police service, but, given the many and varied areas of life on the River Thames, the Metropolitan police has neither the expertise nor the resources to carry out such work. There are several agencies with roles in that area, notably the Port of London authority, which is responsible for maintaining and managing the harbour. There are responsibilities for Her Majesty's coastguard, Customs and Excise and the London fire and civil defence authority. All those agencies work closely with the Metropolitan police, and they will continue to do so. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns but the amendment would not have the desired outcome. We do not believe that the MPA is the appropriate authority to take responsibility in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the hon. Gentleman's request for a public inquiry, there were inquiries post Marchioness. Almost all the recommendations of the marine accident investigation branch into that tragedy and the Hayes inquiry into river safety that followed have been accepted and implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would question the vital role of the Metropolitan police in co-ordinating the response to emergencies on the river, and I have referred to the memorandum of understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I had not forgotten, but I shall not take your remarks as a challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was explaining to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the memorandum of understanding, which was signed by the Metropolitan police and the Port of London, deals with the co-ordination of emergency and major incident responses and search and rescue activities on the Thames. It also deals with routine operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that response. I have three points to make. First, I will make an effort, as the Minister suggested, to see whether we can make some progress on the evidence that would allow the Government to announce a public inquiry into the Marchioness incident. I will speak again to the survivors. There is a slight difference of opinion between the survivors, relatives and their solicitor on the one hand and I, other hon. Members and the Government on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1304</span>
other. I hope that that is a bridgeable gap. If we make progress, I hope that it will persuade the Government that there is a good case for a public inquiry, which should be held as soon as possible, preferably before the 10th anniversary of the disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to what the Minister cited in response to the proposition that the police are the lead authority. The long list of people with responsibility means that it is necessary for someone to take the lead. I understand that there are different areas of responsibility—for example, the PLA looks after piers—and that beyond the boundaries of the Greater London authority, the tidal Thames is in one direction and the non-tidal Thames is in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reflect on whether it would be better to make the Greater London authority the lead authority? That would allow the police, the new fire and emergency planning authority and others to come together under its umbrella, although that would not include the PLA. Someone needs to say, "It is our job to look after safety and security." I would not, however, want us to get stuck on a definition of that. I understand what the Minister said about safety and security including even people walking on piers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easier to respond to the contention of who should be the lead authority in the rescue services—either the MPA or the GLA. I am happy to give the Minister time to reflect on that. Given the number of agencies that are involved, she should consider the benefit of having someone take responsibility for rescue, safety and security—or all three—on the Thames. The Minister might say that if we do that for the Thames, we must also do it for other tidal waterways in London, of which there is, I think, only one—the Lea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the 1996 documents that the Minister mentioned. I did not meant to suggest that since the Marchioness sank, there have not been improvements in safety on the river, because there have. I have followed the situation closely and have randomly monitored it to ensure to my satisfaction that matters such as navigation, lighting, communication, safety announcements and so on are better. They are not perfect and some people still fail to achieve best practice. For example, a safety announcement may be made, but it may be inaudible because of the way in which loudspeakers are rigged and boats are organised. There is a long way to go and a public inquiry could usefully examine the situation not only on the Thames but in other places. For example, in your county, Mr. Winterton, and my county of birth, boats on the river Dee at Chester have been seen to fail to acheive best practice by families connected with the marchioness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not make the suggestion, but it would be helpful if the Minister would arrange for the two memorandums that she referred to as the 1996 documents to be put in the Library. Perhaps she would also reflect on the definition of the responsibilities and whether the Greater London authority might be a better agency to take on those responsibilities, and discuss the matter before Report so that we can see whether we can reach some agreement.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1305</span>
We should ensure that someone carries the can at the end of the day. I did not hear her say that that was ruled out completely, so I hope that agreement will be possible, but I am happy to work on the best way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It should be made clear that as it is a maritime incident, we are discussing a formal inquiry, but there needs to be new evidence for such an inquiry to be opened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is looking for a clear, defined, transparent chain of command to deal with a major incident on the Thames. That is already in place, but I am happy to examine the matter again to reassure him. I do not believe that it would be possible for the GLA or the MPA to lead in this area, not least because of the wide range of existing legislation that affects so many aspects of life on the River Thames. The wider problem of safety on and in the river would not be adequately met and his desired outcome not achieved, but I shall examine whether there is a need for an emergency service. My perception is that the chain of command is clear and understood, and that people can react immediately to emergency calls.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from this part of the Bill that the fire authority is one part of the London constitution that comes out of the Bill quite well, so I hope that we shall be able to wrap up the debate fairly quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments fall into two main groups. The first group deals with the new fire authority, which would have 17 members—nine of which would be mayoral appointments, with the other eight selected from all 32 boroughs. In our view, that is prejudicial to many of the boroughs, which all want to fight their corner as regards
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0701">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1307</span>
the fire authority. There has been a long history of closures in London over recent years. Simply to have one representative from the odd borough would leave many boroughs feeling unrepresented. Therefore, the amendment seeks to ensure that there will be a representative from each London borough and the City of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also tabled a probing amendment to try to ensure that the chief fire officer of the London fire brigade is a member of the new authority. It seems odd that he is not. If he is not to be, perhaps the Minister will explain why she does not consider that appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly to the first group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the emphasis on "briefly".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly will be. I want to address an issue that members of the Committee will have heard us raise so many times that I shall not rehearse the arguments in depth. It concerns the balance between the mayor and the assembly when appointments are being made—in this case to fire authority. We believe that the Government's balance is wrong. We do not need to say any more than that because the arguments have been well rehearsed, but we stick to our view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule raises three further issues. One relates to security of tenure for members of the London fire and emergency planning authority. The second concerns flexibility in the delivery of and charging for services. That is the subject of a later amendment, and we shall listen with interest to what is said when it is spoken to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final issue relates to the way in which the LFEPA is being treated differently from the MPA in setting floors and ceilings for its budget. Those are matters to which I shall return in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue relates to amendment No. 91 and tenure. Earlier today, I asked the Minister why the tenurial office for the MPA was four-yearly rather than annually. I was told that four years seemed a reasonable length of time. Why is four years not a reasonable length of time for tenurial office for the LFEPA? Given that, presumably, it has similar strategic roles to fulfil and duties to exercise, why on earth cannot it have a similar period of tenure? We would be interested to hear an explanation other than the usual one that the Government are rolling forward existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those points, I hope that, on this occasion, the Government might change their mind and, at the very least, deal with our question on tenurial office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I entirely support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South on the question of borough representatives, I should sound a note of caution. Borough representatives will not make much difference to decisions taken by the London fire and civil defence authority, or its replacement, the LFEPA. As I know to my cost, despite vigorous campaigning by several borough representatives, the decision to remove a pump in Hillingdon—there are four other pumps in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1308</span>
London area—is to go ahead. Sadly, extra representatives cannot ensure that the interests of boroughs are given the priority that they deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seems to have two main purposes: to increase membership of the new fire authority, and to make the chief fire officer a member of the fire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 1074 and 1075 are based on the misapprehension that the chief fire officer will be a member of the LFEPA. I assume that that acronym will be pronounced "El Fepa", which is how the chairperson of the present fire authority referred to it. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds like a wine bar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the chief fire officer is a key figure for the fire authority, but chief fire officers are not members of fire authorities elsewhere in the country and we would not want to establish that precedent. We want to maintain the principle that all members of fire authorities should be democratically elected. Amendments Nos. 1076 and 1077 also assume that the chief fire officer will be a member of the LFEPA. However, it appears that none of the amendments would actually achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the other amendments, I am surprised to discover that the Opposition are trying to reverse our policy of creating a streamlined fire authority of 17 members, which would be cut to approximately half its present size. Streamlining the fire authority was an issue that arose during consultation on the Government's proposals for the GLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also confused as to how the total of 43 members, to which amendment No. 1068 refers, is arrived at. I assume that it is reached by adding together the 9 assembly members, the members of the present fire authority—which comprises 32 borough representatives and one common council representative—and the chief fire officer. However, although the amendment includes the common council in the equation, amendment No. 1070 does not do so. Under paragraph 12 of schedule 18, the common council is deemed to be a borough council for the purpose of determining membership. In view of that, I ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw the amendment, before we have to go into any greater detail about the arithmetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam spoke to some fairly typical Liberal Democrat amendments to remove powers from the mayor and transfer them to the assembly, or to the chair of the assembly. Under the amendments, the nine assembly representatives on the fire authority would not be appointed by the mayor but elected by the assembly. We have been through that argument many times in relation to different parts of the Bill. The eight borough representatives would be appointed not by the mayor but by the chair of the assembly, and the assembly, not the mayor, would determine the period of office of a fire authority member. The assembly, not the mayor, would renew the election of an assembly representative on the fire authority. The chair of the assembly, not the mayor, would renew the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1309</span>
appointment of borough representatives on the fire authority. Notification by the borough councils of their nominations to the fire authority would be given to the assembly, not the mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will not be surprised to learn that we will not accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. They would totally change the mayor's relationship to the LFEPA. The mayor would no longer have any role in the appointment of assembly and borough representatives to the fire authority. We have already dealt with similar amendments. The Liberal Democrats' purpose throughout has been to weaken the mayor's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our policy, endorsed by the referendum, is that the mayor should be responsible for appointing both assembly and borough representatives to the authority. The other powers that we have given to the mayor, and which the amendments would remove—to determine the length of a member's period of office, and so on—are all natural consequences of our approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam are intended to sever the constitutional links between the mayor and the fire authority. Those links are important if the new arrangements are to function effectively and to ensure that the authority is suitably accountable to the mayor for the services that it provides. He asked about one year period appointments. They are renewable, and that provision flows from the existing arrangements for the LFCDA and fire authorities elsewhere. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Croydon, South, may I tell the Minister that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Winterton, for not putting that correctly. I am delighted to be corrected by you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pausing to allow the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to speak, because obviously, once I have withdrawn the amendment, he cannot speak again in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the Minister flaying the Liberal Democrats with her arguments and crying, "LFEPA!" as her glasses slipped down her nose was one of the better sights of this Committee. I am in danger of sounding like a Liberal Democrat because I have been producing an old argument. The reason that we tabled an amendment providing for representatives of each borough to be represented on the authority is of course that we believe in an authority consisting of borough leaders.

Amendment No. 1136, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats, is similar, it would have broadly the same effect, except that the mayor and assembly would not be consulted. It would be illogical for the boroughs, but not the mayor and assembly, to have a say in the process. When he reflects on the matter, I am sure that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will agree to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the Minister's point directly by admitting that some words were inadvertently included in our amendment. They possibly reflect more the Government's intentions than our own. We intended to substitute in our amendment the term "Secretary of State" with the word "assembly". If we had, we would have dealt with the Minister's point. That wording would have meant that the assembly would exercise the powers referred to in the Bill. If LFEPA—or whatever it will be called—wished to increase its membership for whatever reason, that would be a matter for the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment does not reflect our intentions because of the error that was made. We sought to table another amendment to remedy the problem but, unfortunately, we could not. I am pleased to have so much support, given the embarrassment that the error has caused.

Despite the Government amendment that will give the Secretary of State the power to increase or reduce the size of the LFEPA, I hope that they will consider giving that role to the assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would address a concern expressed by members of the London fire and civil defence authority about the power of the mayor to terminate appointments. As we have already established, the tenure of appointments will follow the pattern of the LFCDA. They will be annual and, as with the LFCDA, I assume that that will mean that some members will serve for much longer than a year. Indeed, some members of the LFCDA have been on the authority for 10,12 or 13 years. For example, Councillor Ritchie from Southwark has served on it for an awful long time and symbolises much about the authority today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to explore what the Government mean by the words in paragraph 2(3) that refer to a member being "unable or unfit" to undertake his duties on the authority. The Bill is unclear and that has caused anxiety among the authority's members. I hope that the Minister will say a little more about the Government's thinking to allay those concerns. We need to confirm that, although perhaps necessary, the provision will be a rarely used safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about the anxieties expressed by members of the LFCDA about the new arrangements. I shall take him through the detail of the schedule briefly, and I hope that he will recognise that there is a thorough logic behind the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2(2) of the schedule will give the Mayor power to renew the appointment of a member because a member's term of office, which is established under paragraph 2(i), is generally for one year. That is different from the arrangements that will apply in the Metropolitan police authority and other bodies. It is simply a product of rolling forward existing arrangements under LFCDA's procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corollary of a mayor being able to renew appointments on an annual basis is that there must be a mechanism for not renewing the appointment of someone who is either not able to fulfil his responsibilities—he may not able to attend meetings because he has moved or changed jobs—or who is unfit for any reason. For example, a person may have committed an act that has rendered him unsuitable to continue or he might not be in good health and, therefore, cannot carry out his responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the mayor will not be able to use the power in an arbitrary fashion. He will be required to give notice, and there is the safeguard of a challenge to the mayor—ultimately through judicial review—if people believe that he has acted in a capricious, irresponsible or arbitrary way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is a straightforward procedure to allow for rolling membership of the LFEPA and for the power to reappoint, or not reappoint when that is appropriate. I

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to explore further the difference between the Metropolitan police authority and the LFEPA in terms of the appointment of the chair or chairman of the relevant bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this morning's debate on the MPA, we established that its arrangements annually to elect its own chair or chairman rolled forward arrangements from other legislation that applies to the rest of the country. I agree with the Minister that that is perfectly sensible for the MPA. Therefore, I wonder why it was not thought sensible to apply the same arrangements to the LFEPA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MPA will apply existing practice in Greater London. For fire authorities, the existing practice in the rest of the country is for them and joint boards to elect their own chair or chairman for each year, but that practice will not apply to the LFEPA. The mayor will make such appointments. Given the Government's desire to ensure that the Bill is internally consistent and that practices are standardised across functional bodies, it is difficult to understand why the Bill does not provide for members of the LFEPA to elect their own chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will consider sticking to their own rule, which seems to be that they roll forward existing practice and apply it in a new structure. Doing so will mean that they will allow the body to elect its own chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am going to disappoint the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. Under the arrangements that we have set in place for the functional bodies that report to the Greater London authority, in the case of Transport for London, the London development agency and LFEPA, the mayor appoints the members of the authority or the body—in the case of LFEPA, the assembly members—and the mayor appoints the chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different arrangements in relation to the MPA for the reasons that we outlined this morning. But for reasons of consistency within the overall framework of the Greater London authority, we believe it right for the mayor to appoint the chair of LFEPA. That is why we are doing so—we make no apology about it. There is a

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that members of the Committee wish, understandably, to conclude today's business, but several clauses still deserve scrutiny with regard to this part of the services for which the GLA is meant to be responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question deals with openness, and the accessibility of the new fire authority's deliberations and decisions. When we considered openness in earlier debates, one of the arguments advanced by the Government was that, because the functional bodies are executive bodies, it would be inappropriate for them to be open to the public. We have just passed clauses which effectively establish an executive body to deliver fire services in London. I am at a loss to understand how that is any different from the London development agency, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we welcome wholeheartedly the local government provisions that the clause introduces for this body, we would like to know how the Government draw the distinction between this particular functional body and the London development agency. Why does one have to meet in public but not the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very simple. The LFEPA is not an executive body. It is an authority, similar to the Metropolitan police authority. Clause 223 applies the local government legislation dealing with access to meetings and documents to the LFEPA, in the same way as it currently applies to the London fire and civil defence authority. The LFEPA is not what the hon. Gentleman says it is—an executive body and therefore not open to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1314</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall read that reply with interest when it is printed in 	<i>Hansard.</i> The argument that I think I have just heard is one in which words mean what Ministers think they should mean to fit their case. To use an expression that I have used before, it was a Humpty Dumpty argument. To say that because something is an executive body and not an authority, and because an authority is not an executive body, that therefore the two are different, seems to be constructing an argument on sand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the discharge of their functions, these various bodies are executive bodies—they will be executing decisions. They are not deliberative talking shops. They will be taking decisions collectively. In that sense, the Government should be a lot clearer about their policy on open government. We believe that this body should be open—although in my experience as a member of the London fire and civil defence authority, apart from very large numbers of members of the Fire Brigades Union who occasionally came along to meetings, not many members of the general public attended, which is sad. It is important that the body is open in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister continues to reflect on the real distinction in law between a body that has the label "executive" and one that is called an authority. There does not seem to be a real difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that we have come to the really important part of the Bill, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that throughout our proceedings, Conservative Members have sought to ensure that the Bill provides the best possible services for London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say that I feel myself to be a kind of Londoner; at least, I paid a substantial sum to own my property in London, I pay council tax in London, I support London retailers and I spend more than half my life in London. I think that I have almost as much interest in the Bill as most other Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, found shortcomings in the Bill that will leave Londoners worse off, not better off. This section of the Bill dealing with fire and emergencies is no exception. The Government are already happy to penalise law-abiding motorists with the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Bill, but we now find that this Bill lacks any protection for the homeowner or motorist who lives in London and calls out the London fire brigade for assistance that is unrelated to a fire. Will the Minister reassure Londoners that the Government's programme will not introduce a charge for a fire service call-out on special service calls, which include cutting a motorist from the wreck of a car and rescuing a household pet from a tree?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot guarantee that charges will not be introduced, how does he explain the different charges that would fall on a motorist who crashes outside the GLA border, but who is cut free by an LFEPA fire appliance? Why should Londoners who are motorists and home owners pay higher insurance premiums for those non-fire-related call-outs? Will motorists who live or drive in London be happy about the fact that the Government are introducing yet another tax on the cost of motoring?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Household insurance in this country is voluntary. If the Minister intends to introduce charging for non-fire-related callouts, I assume that he intends to recommend compulsory house insurance for all Londoners. If he does not do so, who will foot the bill for the call-outs, other than the local boroughs? I also assume that the Bill will prevent LFEPA fire appliances from assisting in non-fire call-outs that are outside the GLA boundaries, unless the county councils guarantee to pay for the cost of those special service calls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter, and I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitzpatrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak against new clause 80 and in favour of new clause 82, which stands in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 80, which was moved by the hon. Member for Solihull, is fatally flawed, despite the fact that he read the script on behalf of the hon. Member for Croydon, South very well. If there were no charging for special service calls, that would undermine the ability of the fire authority in London to charge for those calls that are not of an emergency nature. For example, consider a swimming pool that cannot be emptied. To deal with the drainage problem, the fire brigade might be called in to pump out the swimming pool. That would involve a commercial service rather than a humanitarian or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1316</span>
emergency service. It would be categorised as a special service, and it would not be appropriate for London taxpayers to subsidise a private operation by their local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fire authority would be entitled to claim a charge in that case, and in other contexts. I spent 23 years in the London fire brigade, and I know that some calls are abusive. The authority and the London taxpayer are entitled to seek compensation in connection with such calls. Staffing resources are used by people who take advantage of the fact that the service is available—they dial 999 and use the facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question that the hon. Gentleman can probably answer, although I certainly cannot. Do the rules about charging that apply in London apply elsewhere in the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitzpatrick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Special service calls are referred to in the Fire Services Act 1947, and they are therefore national.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Solihull discussed road traffic accidents. The ambulance service already charges for responding to road traffic accidents. I do not support the idea that anyone who dials 999 should be charged, but we should consider compensating London taxpayer in respect of services for which the money can be clawed back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 80 directly contradicts new clause 82, which stands in my name. I should like to express my appreciation of the advice and assistance of the Public Bill Office. This is my first opportunity to attempt to amend legislation, and despite being a Member for almost two years, some aspects of the House remain matters of exploration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intent of new clause 82 is straightforward and simple, although Committee members who have read the new clause may not agree. It would aid hon. Members understanding if they had been in the House when the Local Authority (Goods and Services) Act 1970 was passed. Given many of the statements by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, he may have been involved in passing that legislation. If not, perhaps one of his relatives was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause relates to the new London fire and emergency planning authority—LFEPA, which, as El Fepa, is a Spanish pseudonym and cousin to El Cid, which is a code name for the Metropolitan police authority, or CID. I apologise for that joke—it is late. The fire authority would be put on the same footing as fire authorities across the country that are attached, for example, to shire counties. It would be able generate income through marketing fire safety, fire precautions and fire training to the private sector. Companies that wanted to improve the safety of their staff and evironment, beyond the statutory requirements for inspections and certification, would be able to pay for the fire service's expertise and advice. Fire services attached to county councils and shire authorities can already do so—through education legislation and other legislation—as can the Metropolitan police authority, which was included within the orbit of the Local Authority (Goods and Services) Act 1970. The London
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1317</span>
fire and civil defence authority has not been able to generate income and LFEPA will not be able to generate any of its own income unless the new clause is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to elaborate on the London fire service's budget difficulties, which are well documented. The new clause will not solve those difficulties—this morning we discussed the structural problems of pension deficits and other matters—but it would afford the fire service the opportunity to take advantage of the facilities provided by the London taxpayer to generate income that would help at the margins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is not controversial. Although I commend it to the Committee, I have an inkling that alternatives exist. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman is right to say that the power would add some flexibility only at the margins, the wording of the new clause is not precise enough to enable that to happen.

Fire authorities often try to recover costs through charges for special services where possible, but they would not usually do so for emergency or humanitarian services. The discretion of fire authorities would be taken into account as part of any future review of the Act. The issues are sensitive and complex, but as a matter of principle it would be inappropriate to impose a restriction on the LFEPA that did not apply to other fire authorities. The new clause is defective because the relevant authority is the LFEPA, not the mayor. In addition, the term "special services" would need to be
