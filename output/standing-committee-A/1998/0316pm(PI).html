	<div class='page-header'><h1>Greater London Authority Bill</h1></div>
	<p>(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must inform the Committee that, unfortunately, Government new clause 84 has been printed in the wrong place on the amendment paper. It has been printed under new clauses relating to part VII. Members of the Committee who know the Bill well—which means all members of the Committee—will realise that it relates to part VIII. We shall of course deal with it when we reach that part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. The Committee will be aware that, yesterday afternoon, I answered a Parliamentary question relating to the planning provisions that will apply as and when the new arrangements for the mayor's spatial development strategy and planning powers are brought into effect. The eagle-eyed hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) spotted a minor typographical error in the record printed in 	<i>Hansard.</i> To ensure that the Committee has a full and up-to-date version, I will circulate a revised copy to all members of the Committee. I am assured by the 	<i>Official Report</i> that a fully accurate version will appear when the bound volume of 	<i>Hansard</i> is printed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all members of the Committee are grateful for that correction and clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 210</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>OPENNESS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before responding to the clause stand part debate on clause 210, I should like to take this opportunity to clarify a comment that I made before lunch about the effect of clause 208. As I said, that is a simple clause, which applies to the Metropolitan police authority the requirement to secure the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force in its area. I inadvertently said that that duty is currently placed on the Home Secretary, as police authority for the Metropolitan police district. That is not the case. The duty is currently applied under section 6 of the Police Act 1996 to all police authorities outside London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of clause 208 is therefore to apply to the MPA a provision that applies to all existing police authorities outside the capital. It ensures that the general functions of the MPA will be the same as those exercised by other police authorities. I wanted to put that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1242</span>
clarification on the record, to ensure that no one felt that I had misled the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 210 relates to the openness provisions of the MPA. In speaking to the clause, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) rightly welcomed its commitment to openness. I appreciate that welcome from the Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman highlighted a number of issues—in particular, freemasonry. I should make it clear to the Committee that the Home Secretary has given the Select Committee on Home Affairs a commitment that internal police force registers will be in place by this April. Work is in progress to achieve that objective. The hon. Gentleman also asked about publication of the registers. After the internal registers have been established, it will be necessary to agree arrangements with the police service that allow for public access to information that has been voluntarily disclosed by individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main provisions of the clause provide that meetings of the MPA shall normally be open to the public, that copies of agenda and reports for meetings shall be available for public inspection and that their minutes shall also be available for such inspection. Those provisions bring the MPA into line with provisions that apply generally to local government bodies under part VA of the Local Government Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the clause is welcome, and having answered the questions of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>GENERAL FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSIONER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Proposed new section 9A(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In discharging his functions, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis shall have regard to the local policing plan issued by the Metropolitan Police Authority under section 8."</p></blockquote>
My point could perhaps have been made during discussion of clause 208, but the Committee had a prolonged and fairly wide debate on that clause before the sitting was suspended for lunch. The London policing plan may have implications for local authority community safety plans, produced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Will whichever Minister replies tell the Committee how the two will fit together? The Opposition would like the Government to give an undertaking that targets set for the MPA must take account of targets set in local community safety strategies, which express the wishes of local people in relation to crime prevention and reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1243</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a linked and similarly short point. One welcome feature of policing in London is that a cascade or waterfall effect operates in policing strategy, which allows people to contribute to debate about it. I understand that the Home Office sets a number of policing priorities for the country as a whole, and that police authorities formulate their own policing priorities, so that local policing priorities are set in their police authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question that links to that asked by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). Given that the clause provides that the Commissioner shall act within the boundaries of the policing plan of the MPA, will the Minister tell the Committee what timetable is likely to operate now and in future? That would allow people to know when they can participate in the process of formulating priorities. I have found such participation very useful, as have my constituents, as it has sometimes influenced and changed priorities. If people knew about the annual routine and if it had some regularity, there would be greater participation and benefit in the process of formulating plans locally, regionally and nationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster rightly asked how local authority input and relations between the Metropolitan police and local authorities—especially in pursuance of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998—will mesh with provisions for the MPA and the local policing plan. Clause 211 sets out two main requirements. First, it provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The metropolitan police force shall be under the direction and control of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis".</p></blockquote>
Secondly, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In discharging his functions, the Commissioner … shall have regard to the local policing plan issued by the Metropolitan Police Authority".</p></blockquote>
In preparing the annual policing plan, the MPA will want to have regard to approaches in place elsewhere in London by using detailed arrangements agreed between the Metropolitan police and individual borough councils. I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department adequately stressed that point earlier in the debate. She emphasised that our putting in place the new MPA will not prevent or discourage effective local liaison about policing arrangements between individual borough councils and the local police. There is no legal requirement for the policing plan to take account of plans that are drawn up under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, but the MPA will be consulted on plans that are prepared under that legislation. It is a matter of good practice that consultation should take place between the MPA and individual London boroughs. I have no doubt that that will happen, but I have to tell the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that there is no statutory obligation for it to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that once the MPA is set up, the process will not be so much that the MPA's local policing plan will need to take account of the local authorities, but more that the local authorities' plans will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1244</span>
be submitted to the MPA so that it can make its comments on them? The minister referred to consultation. Does he think that that will lead through osmotically into the local policing plan that is set by the MPA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about "osmotically." However, I have no doubt that as part of the good, orderly conduct of public affairs it will be appropriate for the MPA to have due regard to agreements that are being prepared locally between the Metropolitan police and local authorities under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and, similarly, for those initiatives to be communicated to the MPA by the individual boroughs and the Commissioner. As I said to the right hon. Gentleman, there is no statutory provision, but I have no doubt that there will be detailed consultation to ensure effective policing plans for London that address the issues that concern all London's communities. I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey Mr. Hughes and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and that they agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1061, in page 109, leave out lines 13 to 27 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Any appointment of a Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis shall be made by the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>(4) Any appointment of a Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis shall be subject to regulations under section 50.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss No. 1062, in clause 214, page 110, leave out lines 4 to 14 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Any appointment of a Deputy Commissioner shall be made by the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) A person appointed as Deputy Commissioner shall hold office until such time as the Assembly shall decide otherwise by two thirds majority on receiving a request from the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>(5) The Commissioner shall be afforded an opportunity to make representations to the Metropolitan Police Authority concerning the applicants to fill the vacancy of Deputy Commissioner.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This section of the Bill deals with the appointment of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Amendment No. 1061 would require that the appointment of the Commissioner should be made by the MPA instead of the current arrangement by which it is made by the Queen, following a recommendation from the Secretary of State, and that the MPA should have the power to ask the assembly to vote by a two thirds majority to remove the Commissioner.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1245</span>
Amendment No. 1062, which is an amendment to clause 214, would require that the appointment of the Deputy Commissioner should be made by the MPA rather than by the Queen, following a recommendation by the Secretary of State, and give the MPA the power to ask the assembly to remove the Deputy Commissioner from office by a two thirds majority—although the Commissioner would have the right to make representations about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a consistent supporter of the present Commissioner, and have no criticisms at all about his appointment. He has been consistent and energetic in discharging his functions and has done so very well—sensitively and proactively in the difficult areas that we all know about. He has sometimes taken the public's side, even at the risk of encountering difficulty with some of his officers. He has clearly seen it as his duty to deliver good policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not know, until preparing for the debate, that although there has been a Deputy Commissioner for a couple of years, it is a title of honour; he is not a creature of statute. The Bill provides that the Met police will have a deputy as an official post holder provided by law, which will rightfully put it on the same footing as other forces in England. I am not sure about the City, because that is anomalous. However, I welcome the idea. It seems entirely sensible to have a senior officer and also to have provision for someone appointed to a recognised post of deputy commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether it is right that, alone among police forces, the chief police officer is appointed by the monarch. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster probably knows much more about this than any of us from his indepth historical knowledge. My understanding is that the monarch's appointment derives from the fact that the Commissioner was perceived as having a governmental or civil servant-like relationship to the monarch—he would, in particular, protect the monarch's person—unlike other chief officers of police. That is the reason for that format of appointment. My understanding is that in the other police forces in England, the chief officer of police is appointed by the Home Secretary on the recommendation of the police authority. We are arguing that the same procedures should apply in London as apply elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the reasons for objections to that proposal. However, I should like to pray in aid three things. First, the position of the Association of London Government is one that we advocate. Secondly, the belief is widely held on a cross-party basis in London. By coincidence, I heard on my radio this morning about Lord Harris of Haringey speaking at a meeting today and arguing that the appointment should be made by the MPA, or at least that it should make a recommendation to the Home Secretary. The third is the Macpherson report, which specifically recommended that London should not differ in this respect from other police authorities. So there are three supporting personae arguing collectively, with authority, and after reflection, for such a proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one point of substance about why this is a good idea and then deal with the reasons against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1246</span>
it. Instead of being a force that is run by government, the Met would become a force that is truly accountable to the representatives of London. We were debating earlier the fact that the MPA will have a similar structure to other police services—a majority of elected representatives, a minority of magistrates and a third group appointed from elsewhere. If the MPA is to have control of the Met's strategy—not the operational, day-to-day service—withholding from the authority its power to appoint the commissioner would be to deprive it of the ultimate power. To use a timely parallel, it is a bit like giving the power to appoint and get rid of commissioners in Brussels to the Council of Ministers, not the European Parliament. Had the Commissioners in Brussels not resigned last night, they could have been collectively sacked by the European Parliament. As it happens, that was not necessary. So if we are really to democratise and rationalise London policing, the commissioner ought to be appointed by the MPA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second way of dealing with the defence of this argument. I know that the Met police have certain duties that are regarded as different from those elsewhere in the country. First, they are regarded as having royal policing duties, but so do the police in Norfolk, Tayside, Lothian, and all other forces when the monarch or the royal family travel elsewhere round the country. Secondly, it may be said that the Metropolitan police have special diplomatic functions. They do, because embassies and consulates are by and large based in London, but ambassadors and consuls do not do their work here alone; certainly consuls have offices in other parts of the country than London. It is no longer the case that the Met has exclusive jurisdiction over the work of heads of foreign missions and the British head of state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Home Secretary currently has the power to appoint elsewhere, it seems perfectly proper and reasonable to compromise and to allow the Home Secretary to appoint the chief officer of the Met. That should be done in the same way as the Prime Minister appoints bishops in the Church of England—I do not pretend to advocate that, but it is current practice. After various processes he is given a list—it happens to be a list of two—from which he selects a name. He is also entitled to reject the names.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy for Ministers to say, as a way of accepting the general proposition, that they are willing to concede that it should not be a monarch's appointment, or it should be a monarch's appointment in name only—although I would rather it was not a monarch's appointment at all; we would prefer that it came via nomination from the assembly, it being the body charged with policing in London. The Home Secretary would then choose from the names that the assembly had produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There needs to be a power to remove a chief of police, just as there needs to be a power to remove other chief officers of public services. They can be suspended and, if necessary, they need to be able to be removed. At present, that power is vested outside the new authority. It seems proper that the London police system ought to have the power to remove a chief of police if that was thought to be appropriate, but only in particular circumstances and with checks and balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1247</span>
Our proposal is not rash; it is cautious. It would mean that the MPA had to make a request and that the assembly—the parliament of London—had to consider it and agree by a majority of more than two thirds of its members. Thus, if ever it was to happen, two bodies would have to agree, one by majority and the other by a two thirds majority. I hope that Ministers accept that we ought to modernise London police structures as well as change them, and that they will therefore be sympathetic to the amendments. I am entirely happy to accept that they might be taken away for redrafting and presented with a ministerial formulation of words, if that was an acceptable compromise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats and the official Opposition did not agree on a set of amendments that was tabled this morning. I must tell Liberal Democrat Members that the same applies this afternoon, except that this time Conservative Members disagree with Liberal Democrat amendments. Of course I appreciate the logic of the amendments, which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spelt out. They obviously relate to stated practice elsewhere, which the hon. Gentleman cited as a parallel. He cited also the support of the Association of London Government, which all Committee members have been able to read. In addition, he drew our attention to recommendation 6 of the Macpherson report, which suggests that
	<br><blockquote><p>"proposals as to the formation of the Metropolitan Police Authority be reconsidered, with a view to bringing its functions and powers fully into line with those which apply to other Police Services, including the power to appoint all Chief Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service."</p></blockquote>
Despite the case that the hon. Gentleman mounted, the official Opposition disagree with him and side with the Government in support of the proposals in the Bill.

With regard to the comparison with other police forces, perhaps you will allow me to refer to schedule 17, Mr. Winterton, which has a bearing on that. On page 216, paragraph 93 of schedule 17, which concerns investigation of complaints, states
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the complaint is about the conduct of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis or the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis … the appropriate authority shall notify the Secretary of State; and … the Secretary of State shall appoint a person to investigate the complaint."</p></blockquote>
That provision amends section 68 of the Police Act 1996, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No member of a police force of a rank lower than that of the member whose conduct is the subject of a complaint may be appointed under subsection (3)"—</p></blockquote>
under which
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate authority shall appoint a member of the appropriate authority's force or of some other force to investigate the complaint."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the logic of that is that the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner are of a rank senior to any chief constable in the land, so they could not be dealt with under that process. The responsibility to decide who should investigate the complaint is therefore transferred to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1248</span>
Precisely the same logic appears to me to apply to the appointment of the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner. As the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department argued this morning, the Metropolitan police force is a different force, and the level of rank calls for the involvement of the Home Secretary and for the provision of advice to the Queen. I say that simply in order to establish the difference between the Metropolitan police and other forces, which was the opposite of the argument deployed by both the Association of London Government and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about subsection (3) of amendment No. 1061, which relates to dismissal. I speak personally, but when I reflect on the events of the past month or so in relation to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, my view is that we would be much less likely to have stability in the upper leadership of the Metropolitan police if decisions were inevitably politicised by being taken by the authority, almost one half of which—as we discussed this morning—will comprise members of the assembly. I have grave doubts about whether the present Commissioner would have survived a debate within the MPA and continued to hold office. I know of the majority figures to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was external debate about whether the Home Office or No. 10 was seeking to keep the Commissioner, in the period leading up to the injunction episode, but that was at least a more stable situation than would have been afforded if the authority had had to take the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point, although I disagree with his analysis of what might have happened. Does he accept that in the rest of the country, it is the role of police authorities to consider reports given to them and any concerns that they may contain? Whatever the importance of the post holder and the post, there is no reason why the same processes of police discipline should not apply throughout England for senior officers, as well as for those of lower rank.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not accept that, on grounds of reality. The sort of circumstance in which the future of the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner will be at issue will be of a totally different order of political magnitude than is the case for other forces. I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument; but my position in any case rests on the fact that the structure places the chief and deputy commissioners in a different role. Any willingness to give such a role to the MPA would have been enhanced by Opposition amendments discussed this morning. I disagreed with the Liberal Democrats on that point, and they disagreed with the amendments, which sought to include members of local authorities in the MPA, and would have given it a different balance. Despite the Minister's remarks this morning, the membership of all other non-metropolitan police authorities is contributed to by local authorities. London is being treated differently in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am not without sympathy for the overall thrust of the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The Committee will soon discuss amendments directed to the same issue, although, I freely acknowledge, in a different way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for not being on your right hand this morning, Mr. Winterton. I am deeply unhappy that I missed the benefit of your chairmanship, although reports of the debate lead me to believe that that is the only thing on which I have missed out. Having heard assorted 20 and 30-minute perorations from Opposition Members, I am glad that I missed the sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses in the part of the Bill before us are very serious for the future of London. Without making cheap party points, I accept much of what the Liberal Democrats have said, although I disagree. Unusually, and in contrast with some of the amendments that the Committee has had to endure during the past few weeks, the debate transcends the sixth-form debating lobby and should be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am being perverse, but my reading of clause 212 and the other clause to which the amendments refer—clause 214—is not the same as that of the Liberal Democrats. I read them as providing the MPA with a significant degree of influence, certainly on appointments. As the Committee will see when considering clause 215, such influence relates also to the removal of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. That configuration operates in respect of what we know to be a royal appointment, but is essentially between the Home Secretary, the mayor and the MPA. There is nothing in the clauses to suggest that we cannot get the configuration right to ensure that the MPA has a very significant role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the difficulty is that Opposition Members cannot take a step outside the processes that we are building for London. That has been a problem during discussion of other parts of the Bill. They cannot see the Bill as a whole and in the round, or visualise the new structures that it creates. They are always seeking to consider various aspects of the Bill in the context of this place, of local government or of some other experience, when it in fact provides a new experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot conceive of a set of names produced by the Metropolitan police authority being rejected out of hand by either the Home Office or by the mayor, and not prevailing. In the context of earlier remarks about openness, I must say that I cannot imagine openness not applying in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not just reinvent local government, and certainly does not reinvent what prevails elsewhere. I shall explain that point in more detail in a moment. I must say with hand on heart and with due deference to all democratically elected colleagues elsewhere that whenever a real conflict between a chief constable and his or her local police authority has occurred, the resulting scrutiny and resolution has not been edifying, either in terms of the democratic process or the accountability of the police force involved. I can think of no case in which democracy has prevailed or integrity been upheld, or in which all parties have not looked rather foolish, given the tribalism that has emerged in such proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1250</span>
I have another point that I shall make in passing, because the Committee should not dwell on it now. I disagree with the thrust of recommendation 6 of the Macpherson report in relation to the clauses, and with the thrust of the comments of the Association of London Government and of what dear old Lord Harris of Haringey said this morning. I fundamentally disagree, not least because there are still significant reasons why the Metropolitan police force and London are different and distinct. Just because royal personages toodle off to Norfolk every now and then, that does not mean that Norfolk county police force has to provide the same measure of royal protection as the Metropolitan police. Just because there is the odd concert in Belfast, Edinburgh or Bristol does not mean that the diplomatic and international stage is ever present in the way that it is in the metropolis. The unique and particular nature of London means that the balance between the MPA and the Home Secretary is vital. The argument of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has not detracted from my belief that London is different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, what is his reaction to the suggestion that, rather than the MPA or the mayor having the right to make representations, the MPA, the mayor or the GLA should have the power to propose names, with the Secretary of State having the power to dispose? That would go one step further than the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The eventual balance and configuration between the MPA, the mayor, the Home Secretary and royal appointment—all elements present in the Bill—is a matter for evolution and subsequent development. That will hopefully be elucidated on by those on the Government Front Bench. The strategic nature of London's governing architecture is unique—there is no equivalent anywhere else in the country, if one excludes the Scottish and Welsh dimensions. It is not a county structure, and cannot be compared to the government of Norfolk or of Birmingham. Given that, clause 215 is a significant advance if one looks beyond the dry legislation. Its provisions about removal with the approval of the Secretary of State cannot be viewed in terms of a kind of tribal contest in which the MPA says that it wants to get rid of the person concerned and the Home Secretary says, "No, you can't." These events, in policing as elsewhere, will unfold on a massive international stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that everything that we need to take policing in London forward with democratic accountability is in the Bill, and that that will evolve into the system that London wants. I therefore urge those on the Government Front Bench to resist the amendment. The two-thirds measure is silly—it goes back to the sixth form. In the spirit of what I have said about the balance between the prevailing forces in terms both of removal and appointment, London can welcome this part of the Bill and look forward to the police authority that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be helpful for the Committee and those outside it to know that these important provisions dealing with the appointment of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and his deputy have the support of Her

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1251</span>
Majesty's loyal Opposition and that that support comes from those on the Back Benches as well as the Front Benches. The amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, well intentioned as they are, have an element of the simplistic. The Commissioner may be a person from outside London. The decision to appoint a chief constable, deputy chief constable or other senior officer from another force could be made much more easily by the Secretary of State, with all the advice that he or she has available, than by the Metropolitan police authority here in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, some dimensions of the work of the Metropolitan police—relating to, for example, co-operation with the Security Service, counter-terrorism work and the functions of the diplomatic protection squad and other specialist units—require the judgment of the Government, with whom the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and his deputy will inevitably have to work. Allowing the Commissioner to be removed by a two-thirds majority of the assembly on receiving a mere request from the Metropolitan police authority could all too easily lead to a politicisation of the appointment, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster explained so clearly. That is the last thing that it needs. The appointment requires stable and consistent judgment at times of crisis and extreme stress. The permanence of the position could be put at risk by perverse and emotional political circumstances which may assail the Metropolitan police authority. Thereby the assembly would do grave damage to the police service as a whole in the capital. I am therefore happy with the provisions of clause 214.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if I am permitted to allude to them, Mr. Winterton, the provisions in clause 215 on the removal of a Metropolitan Police Commissioner seem infinitely better than those in subsection (3) of the Liberal Democrat amendment. The Government can know that they have my support from the Back Benches of the Conservative Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been an interesting, informative and useful debate on an important aspect of the proposals for setting up the Metropolitan police authority—how we appoint and remove the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. It is good that we have had a proper debate on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 212 inserts proposed new section 9B into the Police Act 1996 on the appointment of the Commissioner. It provides that the appointment is to be a royal one and that the mayor will have the right to make recommendations on the list of candidates. I note that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey would remove all involvement by the mayor in proposing recommendations on the list of candidates. Clause 214 makes similar provision for the appointment of the Deputy Commissioner, except that it is the Commissioner rather than the mayor who has the right to make representations on the list of candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1252</span>
I accept that, as several hon. Members, the Association of London Government and other interested parties pointed out, there is an omission in the Bill because it contains no reference to the role of the Metropolitan police authority. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will shortly table an amendment picking that up. I assure the Committee that it has always been our intention that the MPA should have a role in the appointment of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. We had intended to set out the MPA's role in guidance notes, but we accept that there is no reason why that role should not be made explicit in the Bill. We will therefore table amendments at a later stage to rectify the omission. That will be consistent with our general principle that the functions of the MPA should, as the Macpherson report recommended, be the same as those of police authorities elsewhere, except when London's special circumstances dictate otherwise. To that extent, I agree with the part of the amendment which proposes that the MPA should play a part in the appointment process. However, I disagree with the proposals in other, quite important, respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, they would give no role to the Home Secretary in appointing either the Commissioner or the Deputy. That is strange, given that the Police Act 1996 requires the Secretary of State to approve the appointment of chief constables and assistant chief constables outside London, as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster mentioned. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey may have had in mind recommendation 6 of the Macpherson report, which says that the MPA's role in appointing chief officers of the Met should be brought into line with the role of other police authorities in appointing their chief officers. If that is the case, the amendment falls down through being inconsistent when it comes to that recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster pointed out so clearly, it is impossible to draw an exact parallel between the appointment of the Commissioner or Deputy and the appointment of Association of Chief Police Officers ranks outside London, as they are senior in rank to chief constables. In addition, the Commissioner and Deputy head a police force in London which absorbs more than one fifth of all resources devoted to policing in England and Wales and which has national and international functions in respect of such matters as counter—terrorism and royal and diplomatic security. Those are functions for which the Home Secretary will continue to have a particular responsibility. That makes his relationship with the Commissioner and the Deputy very special. For that reason, we consider that the Home Secretary should play a more active role in the appointment of these two individuals than in the appointment of chief constables. The special status of the Commissioner and the Deputy also justifies their appointments continuing to be royal ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also consider that it is proper for the mayor to have the opportunity to make representations to the Home Secretary on the list of candidates for the post of Commissioner. The mayor and the Commissioner will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1253</span>
be two high-profile figures in London. It is very important for all of us that they strike up a good working relationship. It would therefore be wrong to remove the part that the mayor plays in the appointment process, as amendment No. 1061 seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already provides arrangements for the removal of the Commissioner and Deputy. Clause 215 inserts a new section 9E into the 1996 Act; it contains provisions in line with those in the Act for the removal of chief constables. The new section provides that the MPA can call upon the Commissioner or Deputy to retire, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary. Also, paragraph 85 of schedule 17, referred to by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), applies to those two posts the provisions in section 42 of the 1996 Act. That section gives chief constables and assistant chief constables the opportunity to make representations if removal is being contemplated. It also gives the Home Secretary the power to call for a chief constable's removal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1061 would provide a very different removal procedure. It provides that the Commissioner is to hold office until the London assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds majority on receiving a request from the MPA. Amendment No. 1062 would provide the same in respect of the Deputy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why the assembly should have such a role in removing the Commissioner or Deputy. The assembly's influence in this matter, as in the appointment process, should be through the presence of 12 of its members on the MPA which, as I have explained, will have a significant role in the appointment and removal of the commissioner and deputy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey intends the amendment to supersede all the existing provisions in the Bill that relate to the removal of the Commissioner and Deputy, because his proposals are certainly inconsistent with them. If that is the intention, two safeguards would be lost: the requirement for the Secretary of State to approve the removal of the Commissioner or deputy; and their right to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned our intention to table amendments in respect of the appointment of the Commissioner and deputy. We shall do likewise in respect of commanders. I am sorry that the amendments are not before the Committee today. As I told the Committee, we had intended to include them as guidance, but it appears much more sensible to write them into the Bill. The MPA's role will be equivalent to that of police authorities outside London in the appointment and removal of assistant chief constables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said, and the fact that we will propose provisions that are very much in line with the amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, will cause the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was helpful to the Committee by suggesting that the Government are willing to move in the direction hinted at by the

Macpherson report and bring the MPA into the loop. That is certainly welcome. This debate has flushed that fact out, and we shall not make any complaint if an amendment is tabled later. I hope that that will be done in time for consideration on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we would have liked the Minister to have gone one stage further. There is a range of options; I understand that. Later, we will discuss schedule 17, which in any event gives some residual safeguards to the Home Secretary and retains some powers in relation to the Commissioner that are not held elsewhere. That should be a sufficient safeguard. I accepted that what we proposed was at one end of the spectrum. However, there was a position in the middle that would have made the provision exactly parallel, with the Home Secretary making the appointment, but with the police authority nominating. The Minister is saying that she is willing to move a little, but not far enough to make the provisions the same as those for authorities elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position may evolve in time. My hon. Friends and I did not intend to make this a matter of great confrontation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a trailer to these amendments, but I wish to say a word about them. As the Minister recognised, their effect would be to give the MPA the opportunity to make representations concerning the appointment of the commissioner. Under the Bill as drafted, only the mayor will have that opportunity. As the Minister said, and as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said during the previous debate, under section 11 of the Police Act 1996, outside London, police authorities appoint chief constables. Of course, there is a different practice in London, to which the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) alluded in rejecting the Liberal Democrat amendments that we have just discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee—especially the 27 of us who are London Members—are informed by our constituency experience. In a constituency capacity, I want to mention with regard to the appointment being made by the sovereign on the recommendation of the Secretary of State that the massive demonstrations that we have in the capital city, which are remarkable safety valves for our democratic process, mostly—apart from those which, from the Chartists onwards, have begun in Kennington and come across the bridge—in one way or another criss-cross my constituency. My constituents are remarkably patient about their doing so, although I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1255</span>
occasionally receive letters expressing total exasperation. Those safety valves make a notable contribution to the constitution of this land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remark briefly that in 1856, 150,000 Methodists gathered in Hyde park to protest against Sunday shopping. So effective was their demonstration that Sunday shopping was not introduced until the 1990s, which shows what a demonstration can do. The Bill to bring in Sunday shopping had been introduced by Lord Robert Grosvenor, the brother of the Duke of Westminster, so there was a constituency angle to it. I do not think that anyone was killed in the demonstrations in 1859 in relation to whichever Napoleon was then on the French stage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1862 three people were killed during demonstrations relating to Garibaldi. That event gave rise to Speaker's Corner at Marble Arch, which was to provide yet another safety valve where steam could be given off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of the proposals, but as I said, I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the MPA should have at least the opportunity to make representations on the appointment of the Commissioner, so that the authority's role in the process is akin to that of non-Metropolitan police authorities. If it has no input in the process, its accountability and role are diminished. I will not reiterate the converse of that—the fact that Conservative Members think it a mistake that there should be unfettered mayoral appointments which are not subject to control.

The Minister graciously indicated the Government's acceptance of the spirit of our amendments. We want to take that on its merits and in the appropriate coin. We are grateful to her for the spirit in which she responded.

I thank the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for the way in which he moved the amendments. Perhaps it would be helpful if I clarified matters a little, although obviously I cannot go into detail on the wording of the amendments that we will table. They will make provisions with regard to the Commissioner's appointment to the effect that the Home
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1256</span>
Secretary will make his recommendations to Her Majesty having regard to the recommendations of the MPA and any representations from the mayor. The wording in relation to the deputy commissioner's appointment would be similar, except that the Commissioner would be substituted for the mayor. Thus the MPA would be given a role at the beginning of the process, when the new job was advertised and organised. As with the mayor, it could consider all the names that came in and put forward its views to the Home Secretary. That role recognises its right to involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the relationship between the Home Secretary and the mayor is very important and different from anything elsewhere in the country. I hope that the right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point out to the Government, and to the Home Office in particular, which is responsible for policing, that it might be helpful if different tiers of the police did not reorganise themselves so frequently and officers did not get moved so frequently. I recently received a letter from a police officer whom I know, Ian Johnston. I do not think that it is a private letter, so I shall share it with the Committee. Mr. Johnston, an officer of competence and experience, is an assistant commissioner of the Met. In his letter, dated 5 March, he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>Dear Simon,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Following the retirement of Assistant Commssioner Tony Speed, I have now formally taken over as Assistant Commissioner for 1 Area (Central). Assistant Commissioner Denis O'Connor, who formerly ran the South West Area, will be running the south East Area in a

caretaker role, until the final decision on the future Area structure, which we expect in the next couple of weeks. If we go to three areas from the current five, which in the light of consultation seems highly likely, he will run the new South London area, which includes your borough. Denis currently operates from a base in Kingston and can be contacted on"—</p></blockquote>
he then gives the telephone number. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Can I take this opportunity to thank you sincerely for the personal support you gave to me and other colleagues in the South East Area, and say how much I enjoyed the privilege of working with you during my five years in post."</p></blockquote>
The point of that is that during the history of the Met over the past 15 years, areas have changed on a regular basis—there have been three such changes in my region and we have seen other changes at lower levels. When I was first elected as a Member of Parliament, Southwark was managed as one policing division—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People do leave on a regular basis and get moved around. Southwark was divided into three policing divisions. Having done 10 years as three policing divisions, it is now returning to one policing division. On a regular basis, people come into post as local divisional commanders or chiefs for a short time and then get moved on. It would he helpful if there could be a policy, in the Met and more widely, that did not involve areas and structures changing every year or so and people moving around. That is to the detriment of continuity in policing. The officers may be good, but if they keep changing their jobs all the time, it undermines the tasks that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am somewhat at a loss. I cannot connect the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had finished, Mr. Winterton, but I shall explain.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is merely a footnote to the speech by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. Because the Conservative party is more up to date than the Liberal Democrats, I hold in my hand a letter from the Commissioner, dated 12 March, which describes the decisions that have been taken regarding the realignment of the Metropolitan police service. I do not propose to read out the whole letter. You will be gratified, Mr. Winterton, if the details in the letter that relate to Hillingdon are shared with my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain. The letter demonstrates that interventions such as those by my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with a very modest clause, and have been inclined to stray into other territory, including the correspondence which various members of the Committee have received from two of the assistant commissioners. While some members of the Committee have been receiving correspondence from the assistant commissioners, I have been having meetings with them. My good friend—if I may call him that—Ian Johnston, has been assistant commissioner, not for two minutes, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey implied, but for about three years, by my reckoning, in the south-east London area, and has rightly deserved his translation to serve the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster in central London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: About which he has written to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the great pleasure of talking to Ian Johnston before his departure. I thanked him for the very real contribution that he has made in the south-east region, and wished him the very best in central London. I also welcomed Denis O'Connor, the assistant commissioner who is taking responsibility for south-eastern London, as well as south-western London, which he looked after previously. I assure the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that Mr. O'Connor won a very fine reputation in his previous post, and I am quite confident that he will play a very positive role in south-east London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Previous policemen have been referred to as "Denis" and "Ian". I want to know Mr. O'Connor's first name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Denis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point that I should make before we begin an exploration of the nomenclature of chief constables in Macclesfield, Solihull or anywhere else. The Metropolitan police is pursuing a reorganisation to achieve greater efficiency. The purpose of having fewer assistant commissioners is to achieve the optimum effect, with the least bureaucracy. It is right that there should be a streamlined structure, and I am confident that the structure that has been put in place by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will deliver in London the quality policing that we expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 216 amends the Police Act 1996 by inserting into it a new section 9F that deals with the appointment, functions and removal of assistant commissioners. Currently, assistant commissioners are appointed by royal warrant under section 2 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1856. That shows how long the procedure has continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new provisions, the Metropolitan Police Authority will appoint the assistant commissioners, subject to approval by the Home Secretary. That is consistent with section 11 of the 1996 Act, which deals with the appointment of chief constables, to whom assistant commissioners in London are an equivalent

ACPO rank. The provisions for removing an assistant commissioner are similarly in line with those for removing a chief constable.

The clause also provides that an assistant commissioner may exercise any of the powers and duties of the commissioner with his or her agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ALTERATION OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE DISTRICT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A couple of issues arise out of this clause which is small but none the less important because of its implications for a number of parts of the service for which the Metropolitan police are currently responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the realignment of the Greater London authority boundary. It brings the Metropolitan police district into alignment with the Greater London administrative boundary. The issue has been aired previously in Committee, but we need to return to it at this stage. There are two matters that I wish to raise. One concerns the MPA's budget, and the process by which it will be drawn up. The other relates to black taxis. The Committee has spent a little time discussing them, but some issues are still not clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks ago, after the Committee's consideration of clauses relating to the process for drawing up the authority's budget, I tabled a question to ascertain when Ministers thought that they would publish the provisional budget or any budget including the component budgets for the GLA. On 16 February, the Minister for London and Construction provided an answer informing us that a provisional budget should be ready by the end of November and that the budget itself will be published in February, in line with the local government settlement. I have some questions about the timing involved, and about how widely available the provisional budget will be from November onwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the clause, however, I should like to ask about the additional complications in drawing up the MPA's component budget for the GLA, which is a process that is currently under way. First, additional transitional costs will be associated with aligning the two boundaries. How will they be picked up? Will the Home Office pick them up through some form of special grant to the Surrey constabulary, or will they be financed through the MPA? It would be useful to hear some view on how that matter will be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I have received representations from my local police consultative group about one of the potential downsides of the realignment. The group supports the realignment, as I do, but it is nevertheless concerned that reducing the size of the Met in the proposed manner will especially disadvantage outer London police divisions because of the level of resources available to them. A
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1260</span>
specific concern in my area is the formation of a Sutton police division. It will be welcomed, properly co-ordinate and deal with the issues involved in community safety strategies, which were referred to earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern, however, that the division may not be big enough to be viable in respect of fulfilling the various responsibilities of a police division. Will the Ministers, in their early considerations in drawing up the provisional budget, give some indication of whom they will consult about the issues, and of how they will take them into account in developing funding to enable the GLA to discharge its police responsibilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Liberal Democrats should like to put on record our view that if a provisional budget is to be available from November 1999, it would be helpful to all concerned—not least mayoral candidates and to people aspiring to stand for the assembly—to have the earliest possible access to that budget. It would be helpful for them to have their say about its contents and to prepare themselves to run it for the first 12 months of their terms of office. Is the Minister willing to consider early publication, although it might lead to placing caveats on the provisional budget?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue that I wish to raise concerns taxes, and was raised by my hon. Friend the member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), some little while ago in the Committee's 15th sitting. The debate established Ministers' concern about some of the changes that might affect taxes, and the Committee was given some welcome assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out that 1,365 of the 22,000 licensed taxi drivers in London would be affected by the realignment of the boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From an answer supplied to me today by the Minister for Transport in London, I understand that some 444 drivers hold licences covering the sectors affecting my constituency and borough. I know only too well that those drivers are concerned, because a great many of them have written to me and have come to see me at my surgeries to express their continuing concerns about the process. From the Minister's written answer, I understand that a review is currently being conducted into the outer London sectors in which the licensed drivers can operate, to see whether they are of a reasonable size. That is a welcome exercise, because one of their concerns, which needs to be considered by Ministers, is that the loss of the territory outside the Greater London administrative boundary which they can currently ply with the existing licence will have, even if only for a transitional period, an impact on their ability to increase their income and improve their livelihood. Therefore, an early move to widen the areas in which they can ply within the Greater London administrative area will be essential to ensuring that their livelihoods are protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. It was brought

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1261</span>
to my attention earlier this week that it is not only cab drivers who may lose out when the boundaries for the areas which they can ply are reduced. There are some disabled people living in the boroughs of Elmbridge and Esher and others round the edges of London who currently enjoy the benefits of the taxicard scheme. As they will no longer be in the relevant area, they will lose that benefit. The need to reconsider this issue, which my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to, is made abundantly clear by that example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. That raises a further concern about the realignment. Are any measures afoot to assist Surrey county council in funding the discharge of its obligations to disabled people currently using the taxicard scheme? Will the county have the necessary powers to be able to continue to operate that scheme? I imagine that, as a transport authority, in some respects it will. However there must be uncertainty among the disabled people who will be affected by the realignment of the boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern today is to establish the timetable of the review, and when taxi drivers will hear its conclusions. They will undoubtedly wish to make representations on the impact that the change will have on their livelihood. I hope that Ministers will continue to review the matter. The realignment of the boundaries is welcome, because it means that there will be a clear MPA boundary with a GLA boundary and all that that means for accountability. However, there are matters on the periphery that give rise to concerns which need to be property addressed. We hope that Ministers will continue to listen, as they have done so far, to ensure that the livelihoods of these 1,000 or more taxi drivers are safeguarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The heart of London is necessarily geometrically less affected by changes to the boundaries of the perimeter than are the constituencies of those Members of Parliament who represent perimeter seats. My speech will be proportionately shorter than that which has just been delivered by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). Nor shall I test your patience, Mr. Winterton, by quoting what Burke said about the Middlesex justices or about the Middlesex Justices Act 1792.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two quick Questions for whichever Minister is replying to the debate. First, it has been suggested by some people, including the director of budgets of the Metropolitan police service, that there is likely to be a transitional cost in changing the Metropolitan police boundaries. I am seeking clarification of whether that is likely to be the case, and whether the cost will be met through an increased precept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question harks back to what I said when debating a previous clause on demonstrations. The change in the boundaries will reduce overall the number of Metropolitan police service officers who can be drawn on to deal with large demonstrations or terrorist incidents within the MPS boundaries. Do the Government envisage any reduction in local residential policing as a result and, if so, what do they intend to do about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two very simple Questions. Can the Government explain why, under the proposed changes in the MPA boundaries, they are not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1262</span>
taking the opportunity—I ask this neutrally—of incorporating the City of London police into the Met? The City of London police force has fewer than 1,000 people. In any logical arrangement of police services, it would not continue as a separate force. Therefore can the Government explain why, given that the other boundaries are being changed, the two forces are not being merged at the moment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what relationship will there be between the newly created Metropolitan police authority and the Royal Parks police? The latter body is generally uncontroversial, but it has recently become more controversial with the discovery that it has certain powers to act unilaterally—for example, in closing roads in the royal parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the agency, not the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected; the Government Whip said that it was the Royal Parks agency. But it appears that certain powers can be exercised within the royal parks without the agreement of a Londonwide authority being necessary. Given that there is another geographically based London police service, it is important that people know what relationship it will have with the MPA, what powers it will have that the MPA will not, and what powers MPA officers will have that the Royal Parks police in their territory will not have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman's last two points first. The relationship with the royal parks will be unaffected by the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the City of London police, as we know, the City of London has always been policed separately from the rest of London. The 1962 report by the royal commission on the police, which preceded the Police Act 1964, considered the policing of the City of London. In the circumstances, taking into account the entirely satisfactory co-operation of the Metropolitan police, it made no recommendation for any changes in those arrangements. We do not consider that there is any need to change that relationship or the working of the City of London police force, which does an extremely good job and works positively with the Met. Of course, it is subject to all the national policing strategies and targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked about the boundary changes. The transitional costs for 1999–2000 were included in the policing settlement. Surrey was awarded £7 million, Hertfordshire £3 million and Essex £2 million. That money comes from a fixed overall policing budget which was set following the comprehensive spending review. We would consider any transitional cost bids made for 2000–01.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work on bringing together and changing the boundaries is going ahead. The effect of the clause will be to exclude from the MPD those areas of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey which are currently policed by the Metropolitan police service. Responsibility for policing those areas is expected to pass to the respective county police forces on 1 April 2000. The intention to change the boundaries was announced last June by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. The Metropolitan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1263</span>
police service, the county forces, the police authorities, officials and other interested parties—including the community police consultative groups, which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned—have been working together to ensure a smooth transition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change will help to promote effective joint working between agencies, particularly in implementing the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. It will also support democratic accountability, because a majority of members on the MPA will be members of the assembly who will have been elected by Londoners. Residents in the county areas that are currently within the MPD will not have a vote in the elections for the mayor and assembly members. It is therefore right that those areas should be policed by county forces where the police authorities already provide local democratic accountability through their majorities of elected councillor members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam feels strongly about taxis—he has already made his views known. However, we considered the matter carefully when we dealt with those issues under the relevant clause. I do not wish to add anything to what my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London said then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered all the points that were raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely confident that the Minister answered my question about demonstrations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of 	<i>Hansard,</i> I will repeat my remarks verbatim, I said that the changes will reduce overall the number of Metropolitan police service officers who can be drawn on to deal with large demonstrations or terrorist incidents within the MPS boundaries.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no: we do not envisage any changes as a result. The right hon. Gentleman may not be satisfied with my answer, but no is the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question will give the Minister time to read the answer; I know that people off can read the minds of Opposition Members. Hitherto, it has been possible for major demonstrations in central London to draw on the Metropolitan police service under the old boundaries, not the new. If the boundaries are reduced, by definitions a number of policemen will fall outside the boundary. Does that mean that only those police within the new boundary will be available for demonstrations? If so, what will be the consequences for local policing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is considered that under the boundary changes, there will be sufficient police within the new Metropolitan police area to cover what would be considered normal demonstrations. Clearly, if necessary, the police will as at present have the power to

	<p>[MR. JOE BENTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>Will the Minister also tell the Committee whether an increased precept is likely because of changes to the magistrates court or probation service? In particular, in terms of the clause and related provisions in clause 209, schedule 7 and schedule 17, it has been suggested that there might be a lead authority responsible for working with the magistrates court service. I am making a constituency point, to which I alluded earlier in my remarks about Bow street. Westminster city council believed that it was in the best position to take responsibility for the magistrates court service because of its concentration in its area. I would be grateful for any indication of whether and when that is likely to happen. I ask that question because of the police-related functions of the receiver, which the MPA will take on, although the existence of a single financial structure for it will mean that its financial roles will be a modified version of those of other police authorities.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who made kind remarks about the receiver, Philip Fletcher. He happens to be a constituent of mine, so I am very concerned that he is treated correctly if he is being abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause abolishes the office of receiver, but I should like to make some clarifying points. The office is unique to the Metropolitan police. When the MPA is established, it will take on the financial functions performed by police authorities elsewhere. Its role will, however, be modified by the existence of a financial structure for the GLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The office of receiver has over the years taken on responsibility for various financial and similar responsibilities in respect of magistrates courts and the probation service in inner London. The Government intend that the receiver's responsibilities in respect of magistrates courts will be taken on by the Greater London magistrates courts authority, when, subject to the passage of the Access to Justice Bill, it comes into being on 1 April 2001. As for the receiver's probation responsibilities, their long-term repository will depend on the outcome of a Government review of the probation service and Prison Service. In the short term, we intend that a residuary receiver will continue to carry out the magistrates courts and probation functions of the post. We will in due course table amendments along those lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to the short-term retention of specific functions of the receiver unrelated to police matters, the office of receiver will be rightly abolished when the MPA comes into being and when all functions currently undertaken no longer exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will abolish the post of receiver, but in the meantime a residuary receiver will for a short time undertake functions that are not yet ready to be taken on by anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1266</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Life is never as simple as it appears to be. We have heard three proposals for abolition. When the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) dug into the matter, we discovered that London Regional Transport was not to be abolished at all. The Traffic Director for London is, as far as we know, still going to be abolished. Now, we have a receiver who is not quite going to be abolished—he is going to be diminished, yet continue. I wish him a good diminished life. It is always worth raising such issues because one never knows what one may find. Abolition sometimes takes longer to achieve than people imagine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard what the Minister said as an answer to my question about the magistrates courts service. My reference to the phrase "shall cease to exist" clearly still has a degree of resonance. The receiver is going to slip from us, disappearing gradually like the Cheshire cat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also answer my question about the capping arrangements for the authority and how they might conflict with the Home Secretary's desire to increase police expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to pay tribute to the entire staff of the civil side of the Metropolitan police, who have done sterling work. I say that not merely because my husband will be their director of surveying and engineering until 31 March.

I cannot envisage a situation whereby a Home Secretary says that there is the need for a certain amount of money to be spent on policing in London and the GLA does not make that money available. The Home Secretary would then say, "We do need that money; it represents the minimum level that I believe is necessary to keep the policing of London at a safe and sufficient level."

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am trying to say is that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will decide whether to apply the reserve power.

	<div class='title'>FURTHER AMENDMENTS RELATING TO METROPOLITAN POLICE ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 310, in page 210, leave out lines 14 to 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to move the following: Government amendment No. 311.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Government new clause 15—	<i>Companies in which local authorities have interests.</i></p>
	<p>Government amendment No. 313.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to the application of the local government capital finance rules, specifically as they relate to local authority companies. New clause 15 brings the Greater London authority and all four of its functional bodies—the Metropolitan police authority, the London fire and emergency planning authority, Transport for London and the London development agency—within section 67(3) of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. It thereby makes them subject to part V of that Act, which deals with local authority companies. In doing so, it ensures that they are covered by the Local Authorities (Companies) Order 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill brings two of the functional bodies within the company provisions—the Metropolitan police authority and the London fire and emergency planning authority. But it does not bring the other two functional bodies within those provisions. Rather than put forward a series of additional amendments, we propose to remove the separate references for the MPA and the London fire and emergency planning authority and to introduce a single overarching provision under new clause 15. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the references that are deleted by amendment Nos. 310 and 311. Amendment No. 313 is a further minor drafting amendment consequential upon amendment No. 311.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explanation makes clear the good sense of this provision, and that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister explained what was not overly clear in the Bill. I think that he omitted to say that the Greater London authority will itself be a company for the purpose of the definition of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989: the four subsidiary bodies will be; I understand that the GLA itself will be, too, so there will be five bodies in that category. I would be grateful for confirmation of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give that confirmation. I thought that I had said earlier that the provision brings the GLA itself and the four functional bodies within that definition, but if there is any doubt about that, I make it absolutely clear that that is the case, and the effect of new clause 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 981, in page 211, line 20, at end insert—

	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The liabilities of the Metropolitan Police Authority in relation to the pensions which are being paid subject to regulations made under the Police Pensions Act 1976 to or in respect of persons who, having served as members of police forces, have ceased so to serve shall be met out of moneys provided by Parliament.".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment, the effect of which would be to transfer responsibility for the payment of police pensions to the Home Office, rather than to leave moneys to be paid from police funds. It is intended to highlight the serious and growing problem of funding the pensions of retired police officers. The burden is now so great that the amount of money available for operational purposes is seriously reduced. No doubt we will have similar debates when we reach part VII in relation to the fire and emergency planning authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend care to tell the Committee the proportion of resources allocated to the police that is absorbed by police pensions? I have heard anecdotally that it approaches 50 per cent., or perhaps slightly more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will get a much more accurate answer from the Minister than he would get from me. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Ministers are engaged in dialogue at present, but I am passing to them my hon. Friend's question about the proportion of pensions within the police budget. That is obviously a general question, but it has particular application to the Met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember being a Minister at the Department of Education and Science when the Treasury, in its wisdom, was seeking to reduce the size of some of the research councils, for which I was the responsible Minister. I remember being genuinely critical of the Treasury's decision that the cost of meeting compensation for those who lost office as a result of that retreat would fall on the research councils themselves, and that there would be no practical assistance from the Treasury to meet that cost. That is a different case, but it conferred a massive disincentive on the research councils effectively to carry out what they were being asked to do. Their total activities were diminished for years because they had to pay those considerable sums out of their operational budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Mr. Winterton was in the Chair this morning, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey got into a little trouble for having raised general matters of police strength in relation to, I think, clause 208. I promise, Mr. Benton, that my observations will be briefer than those of the hon. Gentleman, but they are worth making to reinforce the extent to which pensions are causing problems to operational budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is perfectly entitled to get up to tell me that he said this already this morning, but I will speak a great deal more briefly than he did. Between March 1997 and September 1998, police strength fell by 780 in England and Wales. That figure comes from a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of constabulary entitled "What Price Policing?", published in April 1998. Of those 780, 571 were lost from the Metropolitan police. That compares with the ratio of a fifth, which was given by Committee members on both sides earlier as the Met's proportion of the police as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1270</span>
The 1999–2000 settlement allows for an increase of only 2.7 per cent. As I understand it, the Police Federation's press release in December said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the police service needs at least a 6 per cent. increase just to stand still".</p></blockquote>
It went on to comment on the Government's main manifesto pledge to support law and order and the effect of Treasury decisions on police budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 13 September last year, 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> said that there were reports that the settlement could result in 1,000 officer posts being cut in the Metropolitan police alone. I am not seeking to open a debate on police manpower; as I said, so far as the official Opposition are concerned, that matter will be debated in Thursday's Supply day debate. However, the figures highlight the problem of the encroachment of pension provision on operational budgets. I have tabled this probing amendment to secure a response from the Minister on the Government's current thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must express some sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman's probing. I could enlighten him with some of the figures relating to his hon. Friend's question about the increasing burden that the cost of pensions is placing on police budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just three years ago, in the fiscal year 1996–97, the cost of pensions was just over 10 per cent. of the total expenditure of the Metropolitan police. It was a similar amount the following year, but in the latest financial year it has increased to 11.8 per cent. The percentage of the Metropolitan police budget that will be spent on pensions is predicted to rise at a quite alarming rate. As we consider future budgets for the police—budgets that have been set out in the comprehensive spending review and budgets beyond that—the figures suggest that if the Government do not act on that increasing burden, the cuts in London police numbers that we have seen under the previous Government and this Government will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster gave a Londonwide analysis of the figures. Perhaps I could give an example from my constituency of the effect of such cuts. In the two years prior to the election, we lost more than 40 police officers from the Kingston division, which was nearly 10 per cent. of police strength. This year we are expecting to lose 14 officers. Such cuts affect the ability of our local Metropolitan police to perform the functions that this House asks of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another example from the perimeters of my divisional area. On Hook parade, in the heart of Chessington, there has been a spate of vandalism. Chessington is right at the end of my constituency and furthest away from the main police station of the division. When I protest to the local police chief superintendent and ask what his officers can do, he tells me that because his budget has been stretched so much, it is very difficult to send his police officers to patrol the outlying areas of the division effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1271</span>
Kingston has a very busy town centre with a number of pubs and nightclubs which need policing, especially in the evenings. That absorbs a degree of police man power and woman power. It is very difficult for the police to ensure that they have cover for those areas and to go out to places such as Chessington in the evenings. It is stressing them tremendously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster makes an important point. It may be that there are other ways of tackling the pension problem. Perhaps we could consider the way that the precept is managed and the cap that is put on it, or the way in which costs can be pushed back on to local authorities. Perhaps such matters can be considered as part of reviewing the whole process of capping and of local government grant settlements. That is another way forward, and is different to that proposed by the amendment. The Government have to find some way out of the problem. If they sit back and do nothing, in the same way as their predecessors, the ability of hon. Members' local police forces to patrol the streets and to ensure that our constituents are properly looked after will be reduced year by year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must stress that the solution should be that the police service, in the same way as other public services that have not yet adopted the proposed approach—the armed forces, the civil service and other institutions of public service are cases in point—use private pension schemes. Is not that the way out of the conundrum? Much of the budget is assumed, and it is a growing proportion, as has been explained in our short debate. That will have serious repercussions for the capabilities of the Metropolitan police force, unless something is done about the pension problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but the Liberal Democrats and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster are addressing the problem of the cost of pensions that have already been set up. Such costs will have to be faced during the next few years, and the amendment is not driving at whether the provision and payment of future pensions is addressed in the manner that the hon. Gentleman proposes. We need to settle on-going costs of the Metropolitan police during the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point related to that made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), will my hon. Friend confirm that one of the things that we were told at a meeting with the Commissioner and others was that the problem for police officers as a public service—I guess that the fire service is similar—is that their normal working life is 30 years, so retirement usually occurs at the age of about 50? The same pension total therefore cannot be built up in such services as is built up by civil servants, local government officers or staff elsewhere in public service. Employees such as police officers have foreshortened careers, and pension arrangements therefore may have to be considered separately for them and for people who may be inappropriate for employment beyond the age of about 50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1272</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point, although many different types of private pensions could be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Portable ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. We should consider all types of pension provision, to ensure that the problem does not arise in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Poplar and Canning Town)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to embroil the Committee in a technical examination of the fire service and police service pension schemes, which are virtually identical. As the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) mentioned, the problem is that the pressure is on now. Any solution involving private pensions, were they appropriate, would take 20 or 25 years before enough of a mass was accrued to pay them. The fire brigade pension scheme has one specific difficulty as, I assume, does that of the police. The 11 per cent. contributions, which are considerable, would generate the necessary amount of income, but the private pension market falls down because it cannot guarantee the benefits for injuries and deaths allowed for by the police and fire brigade schemes simply because of the nature of the jobs involved, which is why they were constructed in the way they were in 1947.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, and he is right to focus on the fact that the option of private provision and other arrangements would not help us in our current predicament, which will require fairly urgent action. When my hon. Friends and I visited the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and his deputies to discuss future budgets, he made clear his feeling that the Metropolitan police needed a 6.1 per cent. year-on-year increase just to stand still, because of the effects not just of inflation but of the increasing cost of pensions. He and his colleagues were extremely worried about the settlement contained in the comprehensive spending review. The Minister may correct this figure, but I believe that the comprehensive spending review year-on-year increase of 1.9 per cent. will leave a significant shortfall for the Metropolitan police to meet. That is why we are seeing police numbers being cut, probably in all our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State, Home Office said when this matter was debated on the Floor of the House during the police debate several weeks ago that the Government now take the view that the number of officers that a police force puts on to the streets is no longer a matter for Ministers. The only matter for which Ministers will take responsibility is the police budget. When that suggestion was made on the Floor of the House my hon. Friends retorted that it is ludicrous, when a large percentage of the police's budget is made up of wages and pensions, that Ministers should fail to see the correlation between budgets, for which they are prepared to take responsibility, and police numbers, for which they are not prepared to take responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1273</span>
I hope that the Minister will indicate by her reply that Ministers are rather more open-minded than that debate suggested—that they are prepared to take more responsibility for police numbers and will do so directly by considering how they intend to tackle the escalating problem of pensions costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) made the point that police officers, like fire officers, already pay more out of their salaries into their pension funds. This is not a Met-only issue. Indeed, in some respects the Met police has a less serious problem than some other services. It would therefore be helpful if Ministers would respond in the context not only of the Met but of wider police and pension issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is exactly right. The national percentage of police expenditure on pensions is 12.8 per cent. in the current financial year—that is, 1 per cent. above the percentage for the Metropolitan police. He is right to say that it is a nationwide problem, and we should be looking for a nationwide solution. That may be one of the problems with the amendment of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I accept that it is a probing amendment, but what is required is not necessarily a solution for London only but for the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is a general amendment and is not confined to the Metropolitan police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for pointing that out. In that case, I hope that the Minister will respond in the same way and tell the Committee how the Government intend to tackle the problem not only in London but nationwide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has tabled a helpful probing amendment that has allowed members of the Committee to raise various issues—not directly relating to the clause, but nonetheless useful—about the Metropolitan police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to amend section 14 of the Police Act 1996 by adding a subsection stating that the Metropolitan police authority will meet its police officer pensions liabilities out of moneys provided by Parliament. The Government strongly resist the intended effect of the amendment for a number of reasons. First, it would simply not be right to ask the taxpayer to meet the pensions liabilities of the Metropolitan police authority, which would obviously be considerable given the number of officers involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, such a step would not meet concerns about escalating pensions costs, Indeed, it could have the opposite effect, because it would take away the MPA's incentive to plan ahead and try to keep pensions costs down. Thirdly, it would be invidious to single out the Metropolitan police authority for such a benefit while authorities in the rest of England and Wales continue to meet their pensions costs from their own budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have other practical difficulties. The proposed arrangements fail to take into account the fact that Metropolitan police officers will continue to pay pensions contributions into the force's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1274</span>
fund and that the national police funding formula contains an element to enable police authorities to meet their pensions costs. We recognise the increased burden of police pensions and have increased the proportion of police revenue funding allocated on the basis of the police pensions commitment this year from 13.2 per cent. to 14.5 per cent. for 1999–2000. Those allocations are based on projections of the forces' relative need to spend on pensions produced by the Government Actuary's Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that widespread concern has been felt for some time in the police service about the escalating costs of police officer pensions. Following a thorough review of the police pension scheme, we have agreed, among other things, to seek Treasury agreement for a study of the costs and benefits of introducing a funded scheme for new entrants. We shall shortly be making proposals on other measures arising from our pensions review. "Shortly" means whatever the civil service meaning of the word is, but it will be fairly soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many people who believe that a funded scheme would be an important step forward, but it is not a panacea. The initial costs would be extremely high; there are no easy solutions to the problem of funding. I assume that if the previous Government had thought that there was one, they would have done something about this; but there is no easy solution. Even so, we are aware that some things could be done to help, and that is why our pensions review has been so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the review, which is welcome, not only take into account ways of funding pensions for those recruited in future, but consider the problems of forces such as the Met, which are liable to face very large numbers of retirements immediately? The balance of retired officers' pensions that have to be funded will increase considerably in the next few years. I think that in the next five years, about 25 per cent. of officers in the Met are eligible for retirement. Indeed, they must retire, because they are not allowed to do more than 30 years' service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. This is a matter of concern, not only in the Met but throughout the country. It means that there is even more reason to encourage and recruit young people into the police force. However, our pensions review is considering a wide range of issues, and I have no doubt that it will cover the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. member for Cities of London and Westminster went into the question of numbers. I shall leave my attack on the Opposition's attack on our numbers until we come to the relevant new clause. As the right hon. Gentleman said that this was a probing amendment, and as he has had some responses, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the whole Committee, and in particular to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, for having misled the Committee. The hon. Gentleman alluded to my amendment as being Metropolitan police-specific. He was entirely right, and I was wrong to contradict him and say that I was taking a wider view.

You or your colleagues, Mr. Benton, would probably rule me out of order if I had made this a policewide issue at this stage in the Bill. That is why I tabled the amendment in the context of the Met. However, I think that the record will show that I spoke to it in the context of a wider national involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to hear what the Minister said. It has long seemed to me that in those schemes which are not funded because of a perhaps historically well-founded Treasury belief that that is the sensible way to proceed, the lack of funding has created a continuing and larger problem. The fact that the Treasury is prepared at least to revisit the issue and consider whether an alternative system might be adopted in the future is encouraging news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was grateful to the Minister for her response on a previous occasion, I am grateful to her now for having shed such light as she has on where matters stand. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"If the complaint is about the conduct of the Commissioner"—</p></blockquote>
or Deputy Commissioner of the Met—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate authority shall notify the Secretary of State; and… the Secretary of State shall appoint a person to investigate the complaint."</p></blockquote>
Under our amendment, the first port of call for an investigation would be the authority. It, rather than the Secretary of State, could appoint someone; if it did not do so, the Secretary of State would have the default power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rehearse the arguments that I deployed against earlier amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats—amendments Nos. 1061 and 1062—but I then mentioned the problem that the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner are of senior rank. I do not believe that since I last mentioned it, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has looked up the Police Act 1996 or considered the issue of comparable rank being needed for investigations. My view on that occasion that it was sensible for the Secretary of State to appoint the Commissioner applies a fortiori to what we are now considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for highlighting the key distinction that applies to this passage of the schedule, which deals with investigation of complaints, and in which, in the event of the complaint being against the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner, there is a need for a separate procedure simply because those ranks do not apply elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1276</span>
It is appropriate for the Home Secretary to appoint the person to carry out the investigation—the investigating officer. For the reasons of rank to which the right hon. Gentleman has already alluded, that may not be a serving police officer. In case there is any doubt, it is important to stress that the Home Secretary's role is limited to appointing an investigating officer. Once the investigating officer has completed the investigation, he will then report either directly to the MPA or via the Police Complaints Authority, if it has supervised the investigation. The report will not go to the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, by virtue of paragraph 90 of schedule 17, the MPA itself will be responsible for dealing with disciplinary matters involving senior officers. At present, the Commissioner has that responsibility. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will recognise that there is good logic for the provisions of the schedule. While the MPA has a proper role, because of the nature of the rank of the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, it is right and proper that the Home Secretary should appoint the investigating officer in their cases, as the Bill provides. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When those who study these things read the record of our debates, I hope that they will realise that a consistent attempt was made by me and my hon. Friends to ensure that the powers of the MPA were increased when it was set up. We lost the debate, as it were, when the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster supported the Government and considered the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of the Met to be in a class apart, and therefore that the Home Secretary should have reserve powers in investigations about them, as well as in their appointment. It therefore did not surprise me that the Minister replied as he did. I may tell the right hon. Gentleman that I have not read the Police Act 1996 in the interim; but I have a copy of it here. I have just checked, and it is as I thought that it was. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 985, in page 217, leave out lines 25 to 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 1050, in page 217, line 35, at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving this amendment I shall make only passing reference to the admirable amendment No. 1050, which is tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge. I know that he will want to speak to it himself.

Amendment No. 985 would preserve the status quo as follows. Section 96 of the Police Act 1996 imposes a duty on the Commissioner to consult the boroughs on appropriate policing arrangements, but the Bill proposes that that provision should be deleted. The amendment would preserve that duty, first, because effective policing must be responsive to the different needs of individual boroughs and secondly, because it accords with the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which imposed a duty of co-operation between the boroughs and the Commissioner in devising strategies for the reduction of crime and disorder. It is wholly illogical to seek to remove that duty and therefore negate the underlying philosophy of the 1998 Act, which recognised the paramount importance of tailoring strategies against crime and disorder for individual boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would allude to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall), which has been supported by Liberal Democrat Members. If the Government do not accept amendment No. 985 to remove those 10 lines from the Bill and restore the status quo, a problem would immediately be created. I know that my hon. Friend will speak eloquently on that. His amendment, which could be regarded as an alternative to that of the official Opposition, is certainly a substitute for it if the Government choose to reject amendment No. 985.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to the amendment tabled in my name and, rather worryingly, in the names of Liberal Democrat Members. It is hardly surprising that they have added their names to it, as this particular concern about police consultative committees was brought to my attention by the Hillingdon community police consultative group, which in turn had it brought to its attention by the Southwark Police consultative group. I can see that Liberal Democrat Members obtained their briefing from the same source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not usually a great fan of having lots of committees, which is a bit of a blow when one comes to the House of Commons. However, I want to speak on behalf of the community and police consultative group in Hillingdon. I know from other hon. Members that not all the similar groups around London are as good. We are lucky in Hillingdon to have such an excellent forum, where the three members of the Committee representing Hillingdon constituencies can meet with many members of the community and the police. We have useful dialogue and consultation, which often bears fruit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred to the area structure and the fact that the position of Hillingdon had been changed from the original plan. That is a case where the local authority, the police consultative group and the three Members of Parliament—including the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell), who was accidentally omitted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood—all made representations. I am pleased to say that good sense prevailed, as it sometimes does in Hillingdon. All I ask from the Minister is that where such consultative groups exist and are seen to work well—as in Hillingdon—nothing will be proposed that will jeopardise that position. Will the Government assure the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1278</span>
Committee that the Bill preserves the status of such groups? If it does not, will they assure us that they will not be interfered with?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NICHOLAS WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment to which the hon. Member for Uxbridge spoke. As he said, it is one of three offered to members of the Committee by the Southwark PCCG as ways of addressing a concern that has gone round London, especially among people involved with police consultative groups. They are concerned that the Bill and the way in which the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 envisages placing on local authorities a duty to draw up crime and disorder strategies will bring to an end the obligation to produce police consultative groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation does not replicate the special provisions introduced in the wake of the Brixton riots to provide for such committees. Presumably, it does not do so because it attempts to make London's police arrangements broadly similar to those outside London. It would be a great pity if the Bill were to lose a specific reference to the police consultative group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will at the very least give the reassurances sought by the hon. Member for Uxbridge, even if the amendment is not accepted as currently drafted. The amendment seeks to enable the MPA to issue to the groups guidance on how they operate. It addresses a concern expressed by Ministers about amendments that seek to introduce new consultative arrangements into the Bill, because it provides for the arrangements to continue to evolve and to develop to fit the circumstances of the time. The Liberal Democrats believe that the drafting done by the Southwark PCCG provides a good basis for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was first alerted to this question mark in the Bill by the police consultative group in my constituency, which wrote to me in February. Hon. Members will be delighted to hear that I shall not quote its letter at length. The group put forcefully the view that one of the roles that PCCGs could usefully carry out in future, as London boroughs adopt their crime and disorder strategies, is to provide an independent monitor and check of the delivery of targets set out in those strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of Parliament, we are often invited to serve on PCCGS. Those of us who have done so know that it is useful to hear local police matters debated in a public forum, too few of which exist. Questions involved in local police matters would otherwise not be answered or be addressed properly by senior police officers. Provision for consultative arrangements of the sort that have worked well in London for a long time should be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my remarks by drawing the Committee's attention to Home Office research paper No. 22, Mr. Benton—I apologise, Mr. Winterton: the sudden and seamless change threw me. The paper is entitled, "It's Good to Talk: Lessons in Public Consultation and Feedback", and extols the virtues of the consultative arrangements about which I have spoken. The research has also confirmed the value of the organisations involved. I therefore hope that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1279</span>
amendment, which was moved by the hon. Member for Uxbridge, and which stands also my name and those of my hon. Friends, even if it is not accepted in its present form, will lead to some form of Government amendment to give comfort to organisations that play an active part in policing our community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McDonnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hayes and Harlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge about the value of the Hillingdon police consultative Committee. I have just about recovered from my first meeting with the PCCG in Hillingdon. The local animal wildlife police officer brought along his owl, which immediately evacuated its bowels down my sleeve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the Hillingdon police community consultative group has been demonstrated by the thorough involvement of a wide range of local organisations in my constituency, and the leading edge work that is undertaken with the involvement of the ethnic minority community in Hayes and Harlington in preparing the local police strategy. I agree that there is a need to reassure members of PCCGs that work that there will be structures of consultation that will thoroughly involve the community and build on the best practice of the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My local PCCG asked to see the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Ms Jowell), the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) and me, as the three Members of Parliament representing constituencies in Southwark, to express its concern. It is right to be concerned: PCCGs have come a long way. There was an earlier allusion to the fact that confrontation used to occur. I remember that at the outset there were difficult times between police and community groups in Lambeth and Southwark. I think that the police now value the consultation, as do members of the community. The partnership has grown, and people have learnt to work with each other. That is not to say that they do not give each other a hard time sometimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said to the PCCG, very honestly, that I did not think that it was for us to prescribe what the Metropolitan police authority should set up, or what the GLA should do. To set in stone something so that it cannot be altered by legislation is wrong, but not to ensure that there is such a structure and that the police are accountable would be wrong. Members of the Committee are united in wanting an assurance from the Minister that the Government want such groups to continue and that they will continue under the MPA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and the hon. Members for Hayes and Harlington and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey have said. We have had a very good-natured debate on this matter as on so many others. There is consensus across the Committee. I did not mind whether the Government take the wise advice of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and retain the status quo ante, or whether they move towards the position taken by the Liberal Democrats. The fact is that PCCGs work well, helping to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1280</span>
build local confidence in the police. In view of that, I do not see why they should be abolished. We should build on success where we find it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If any members of any PCCGs have been listening to this short debate, they will have been very pleased. The debate has demonstrated a unanimity of feeling on the importance and value of such groups and of consultation in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should begin by reassuring everyone that, as far as we are concerned, the future of such local consultation is bright indeed. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, and as I know from experience, relations between the police and the local community used to be very bad in my borough of Lambeth. Although PCCG meetings can still be stormy, they are, if not looked forward to, welcomed by the local police and community as an important vehicle for ensuring that the views of the community—by which I mean all members of the wider community—are heard. In my borough in particular, the PCCG has been an important vehicle for ensuring that members of the ethnic minority communities, who have not necessarily been involved feel that they have a voice. I praise the good work that has been done by most PCCGs.

Amendment No. 985 would keep the statutory obligation to consult local people on their concerns and priorities for policing in the Metropolitan police district with the Commissioner, rather than transferring it to the new police authority. Amendment No. 1050 recognises that the responsibility of consulting the public rests with the MPA, but imposes a requirement on it to issue guidance to the existing network of PCCGs. It is important to acknowledge the good work of those groups around the capital and recognise the commitment of the Metropolitan police to involvement with them, which has been particularly important in the light of recent events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to understand why, for areas outside London, the Police Act 1996 places the requirement to consult on police authorities. Taking the views of local people into account is part of the process by which police authorities draw up their policing plans for the area, and the link between public consultation and local policing objectives must be explicit. It is for a police authority to hold the police to account for the objectives that have been set, and the police authority must be aware of the priorities and concerns of local people in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 96(2) of the Police Act 1996, as amended by the Bill, will require the MPA to consult the Commissioner on the most appropriate arrangements for consultation. Although the MPA will be the body that is required to consult, it will naturally consult with the Commissioner on the most appropriate arrangements for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 98 of schedule 17 amends the 1996 Act to bring arrangements for consultation within the MPD into line with other police areas. That is consistent with the policy of giving the MPA similar functions and duties to those of other police authorities. While the Home
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1281</span>
Secretary is the police authority for the Met, separate arrangements are justified, but once an elected authority is in place that justification will no longer exist. The Bill will not stop the Metropolitan police from seeking the views of the public, but it will ensure that the MPA can fulfil the proper role of a police authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1050 refers to the issuing of guidance to PCCGs by the MPA. That is a requirement that is not imposed on any other police authority. Furthermore, as PCCGs are not statutory bodies, for the amendment to work, another amendment would be required to constitute them as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said about whether it was right to try to prescribe the type of mechanism. PCCGs work very well in some areas. In other areas, they work less well, and other consultation mechanisms have been found. It would be wrong to prescribe a particular method. Police authorities are best placed to decide how to obtain the views of local people on policing matters. I do not, therefore, see the need for primary legislation to lay down that a police authority—in this case, the MPA—must issue guidance to PCCGs on how they carry out their role. Home Office non-statutory guidance already exists to advise police authorities on how they might fulfil their statutory duties on consultation. That includes good practice guidelines on establishing an effective relationship between the police authority and any consultative group that they support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that in the areas in which PCCGs are working effectively—for example, in Lambeth in my constituency—there is no way in which the new arrangements will stop them doing so. I assure all PCCGs, and hon. Members who have been speaking up for their areas, that this matter is important to the Government as well as to the people of the areas concerned. I am confident that the way in which we are moving forward is acceptable and in line with what is happening in the rest of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister implying that during the handover from the Home Secretary to the MPA, the consultative groups will continue and cease to operate only if the MPA decides it? In other words, is she suggesting that the consultative groups will be secure during the transition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. The groups will be secure, and many of them will be secure if they are working well and if the MPA feels that are working well. I can give that assurance. As I said, the approach satisfies all the various groups that have expressed their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way emotionally offended by the fact that the Minister was just addressing the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. Southwark police community consultative group drew the Committee's attention to the matters before us, as did other groups. The central Westminster group also drew my attention to them. I shall not pause to speak about Westminster's PCCGs except to say that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1282</span>
everybody, especially the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), knows how well they serve. Westminster has three groups, of which only one specifically relates to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that you, Mr. Winterton, are anxious to conclude the debate, but I should point out that my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge also has an interest in the matter. We have further questions for the Minister, so in the interests of the dinner break, it would be sensible to suspend the sitting in the middle of the debate rather than to try and conclude it beforehand. If you insist, Mr. Winterton, that we carry on, I have some questions to ask the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a tidy mind, and I would like debate on the schedule to conclude before the sitting is suspended, even if the Committee returns slightly later than I had anticipated. I intend to give the Committee one and a half hours for a break and for dinner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as I can. Police community consultative groups throughout London have expressed anxieties about the Bill. I do not think that the Minister's answer will necessarily assuage them, even though the Government are seeking to emulate you, Mr. Winterton, in terms of tidy-mindedness. I understand that tidy-mindedness has caused Government to include in the Bill some of its revisions in existing legislation. I understand also that the consultative groups work in different ways in London, and, from gossip, I am aware that London's police have varying degrees of enthusiasm for how the groups work and about whether they should exist at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a specific question for the Minister about her defence of the new state of the Bill. Section 96(2) of the Police Act 1996 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except as provided as provided by subsections (3) to (6)"—</p></blockquote>
the Bill removes subsections (3), (4) and (5)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"arrangements for each police area shall be made by the police authority after consulting the chief constable"—</p></blockquote>
which the Bill duly amends to the Commissioner—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as to the arrangements that would be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
The original legislation in the Police Act contains very specific references to each London borough and to each district that falls wholly within the Metropolitan police district and so on. The legislation with which we will be left, however, refers to "each police area". Will the Minister explain the Government's definition of "each police area", so that the groups outside have a clear idea of what they are being offered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Randall. I shall then call the Minister and afterwards return to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quite heartened by some of what the Minister said. I was even more pleased to hear about a meeting that I was not able to attend and the incident with the owl—I believe that it has now been named Millbank and is contemplating a visit to Brent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From our discussions—and from the grimaces on the faces of hon. Members on both sides of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V002P0I0687">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1283</span>
Committee—I feel that we are extremely fortunate in Hillingdon. Other hon. Members have obviously had different experiences. I personally am happy with what the Minister said, but of course I always bow to what my colleagues say, particularly those sitting behind me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Uxbridge for his support on this matter. He is obviously involved in his local group, as I am in mine. He will know that I am genuinely concerned that people should feel that any changes to these important arrangements will come about only because people want them and believe that they would provide a better way of consulting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked about the police area. My officials said that they would define the police area as being the whole of the Metropolitan police area as defined in the Police Act 1996. My view is that the Metropolitan police authority would want to consider what the police in London see as the geographical areas, particularly now that they are going to realign their boundaries so that they are based on the boroughs. Obviously, that would be the most sensible way of ensuring that there was consultative machinery in every borough. In some areas, however, consultative groups cross borough boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be too prescriptive. There is every intention of having consultative arrangements that mean something and which will work, and there is great support in the Committee for that. I cannot believe that the newly set up Metropolitan police authority with its keen new members will, as some people may have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1284</span>
suggested, make it its first act to abolish police community consultative groups. That is not going to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can readily understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge was bewitched by the Minister, because she expressed considerable enthusiasm for the concept. Unfortunately, however, as many of us have learnt down the years, the good will of the Minister who responds to the debate in Committee does not change the impact of the legislation once it is on the statute book. I am afraid that some of us will have to stay with the script on the tablets of stone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have absorbed what the Minister said. The most sensible solution would be to provide police community consultative groups outside the House, with the opportunity of reading what has been said in Committee, including the ominous suggestion—from their point of view—that the police area in the Bill would be the whole of the Metropolitan police district. That would cause considerable apprehension in several groups. The hon. Lady gave me a straight answer to a straight question. In the light of that, we shall consider whether we need to table further amendments on Report in order to obtain a greater degree of precision and control over the Government's intentions. That said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
