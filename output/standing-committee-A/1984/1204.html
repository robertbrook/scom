<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr. Ian Gow)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 10, line 10, leave out " a loan made to " and insert " an outstanding loan of ".<br><br>
This is purely a drafting amendment to clarify the clause.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans<span class='memberconstituency'>(Tyne Bridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 have not been called but it would be remiss of me not to ask the Minister to examine issues raised in them, which I see no great difficulty in his accepting. Amendment No. 15 would give him a further power—as he has so many powers under the Bill, I am sure he would not be averse to, another one being thrust upon him—to add as well as exclude land. Amendment No. 16 would involve him in consultation with the local Member of Parliament and Member of the European Parliament, to make them aware of what was happening. I am sure that that would be welcomed by all sides.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will consider those points and respond to them on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mr. John Stradling Thomas)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of courtesy I would not dream of refusing to consider such a polite request from the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans). At this stage, it is difficult to understand how the amendments could possibly be acceptable, but of course I shall consider them seriously.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
<p><i>Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 1 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 2 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clauses 12 to 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 3 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 4 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we conclude our work, I wish to thank you, Sir Philip, on behalf of the whole Committee, for the way in which you have presided over our proceedings. Those of us who have had the privilege of serving under you before have had our admiration for you enhanced after serving on this Committee. I also pay tribute to and thank the Clerk and the staff, to whom we are all grateful.<br><br>
It has been possible to conduct our Committee proceedings thoroughly and expeditiously. That has been due, first to your chairmanship, Sir Philip, secondly, to the Mate quality of this piece of legislation and, thirdly, to the excellent manner in which the Chairman of the Committee of Selection chose the members of the Committee. Our deliberations have also been enhanced by the absence of the solitary spokesman for the Liberal party, the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition, I support the Minister's remarks. It has been a good Committee stage and we are grateful to you, Sir Philip. If we have another Committee which moves at such speed, it might be beneficial to you to have a tape recording of the words that you use when putting Questions, for example.<br><br>
We have had our differences, as we always will, but we can and should put those differences so that the point is made without personal injury. We are very grateful to you, Sir Philip, to your Clerk and to the galaxy of talent on each side of you. We look forward to serving under your chairmanship again, but not, we hope, on the Local Government Bill because that might take some of your time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Cowans) for their kind remarks. As every member of the Chairman's Panel and, I am sure, every Clerk knows, the quality of a Committee depends entirely on the efficiency, expertise and the expeditiousness of its members. On those, or any other criteria, this has been a very good Committee, which I have thoroughly enjoyed chairing.</span></p>
