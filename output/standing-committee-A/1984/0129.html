	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson (Coventry, North-West)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 6, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our sitting last Tuesday when we debated amendment No. 3—we did not vote on it because Conservative Members misunderstood it to be a wrecking amendment—we wanted to find out why the Government proposed not to take the extra six months. In amendment No. 4, on which we shall wish to vote, we come to the substantive point of why the Government are choosing to recreate a situation in which primary legislation will be needed, as opposed to an order, for any extension necessary for the scheme. A prolonged debate will not be necessary provided that we are assured that we can have a full debate on clause stand part. However, in case we did not make our views clear in the discussion of the actual timing of the cut-off point, we now want to explain why we feel that there should be no cut-off point at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme has worked well. But uncertainty in the industry persists despite yesterday's welcome announcement. It may well have been as a result of the onslaught from the Opposition Benches last Thursday that provoked yesterday's welcome statement from the Secretary of State for Defence. We do not claim the entire credit for that. It may have been made for other reasons, such as tidying up the warship yards prior to privatisation. The Government cannot float those shares at half their price as they did with Jaguar, British Telecom and United Scientific Holdings, but they can float them if the order books are full. That may explain the announcement. Nevertheless Opposition Members welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons given by the Minister on Second Reading simply do not stand up. There is no reason to truncate the period for which the scheme has normally been extended. The Bill was introduced in 1978 and was retrospective to 1977. The Labour Government's work extended to 1983 and should go on to July 1985 under normal circumstances. The scheme has been given a six-month extension and from then on primary legislation, and all that that involves, will be required. That was needed when the scheme was first introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reasons were not clear, such as the fact that only 11,000 would be employed. We still regard that as a great number. Three other reasons were also given—that the scheme is expensive, bureaucratic and wrong in principle. Military yards that cover 11,000 people should no longer continue to be subject only to statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see no logic in any of the Minister's arguments. The proposals were not debated on Second Reading. We are not going over the Second Reading again, Sir
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Paul, I hasten to assure you. They were merely tabled then; we heard nothing from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary on the timing that made us think of any further reason for them. We shall come back to the Under-Secretary's assurances and the arrangements for the transitional period on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the scheme is expensive, but he has assured us that in all probability the cost to British Shipbuilders is to be the same as to the Government, so the external financing requirement will be the same for what will be left of British Shipbuilders at the end of 1986. Therefore, I cannot understand why it should be more expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says it is bureaucratic. If the numbers are to be reduced dramatically, why do we still have—in the Minister's memorable phrase—such a "full panoply" of a state scheme? It could be a relatively minor, small, office, with keen, young, quick officials able to deal with the matter efficiently, letting the management get on with running the business. We got the impression at our last sitting, Sir Paul, when Mr. Shersby was in the Chair, that only two matters would concern the yards in future. First, they will be negotiating redundancies which they are having to do as there will no longer be the statutory scheme—the subject of amaendment No. 4—and, secondly, those yards lucky enough to have some warship capacity and interest will be trying to get privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a dim outlook. It could even be argued that we should keep the state scheme so that the management was free o negotiations on redundancies and the intricaceries they involve. I thank the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for tabling the information that he promised at our last sitting. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) will wish to examine those intricate mechanisms closely. I do not know why British Shipbuilders has to be so bueaucratic, now that it has run down to 11,000 workers. It could be administered easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the scheme is wrong in principle. But he himself says it has provided a valuable tool. The management within shipbuilding has changed and it has helped in an extremely difficult period. What is wrong in principle with that? What the Minister has said is that the scheme is right in principle but has be come too small to be bothered with. He is flogging off the warship yards and therefore no longer is interested. That argument does not stand up, and we, therefore suggest to the Government in amendment No. 4 that this is the wrong time. Anxieties surround virtually every one of the yards—with perhaps some exemptions from uncertainty and anxiety because of the orders yesterday by the Secretary of State for Defence, placed after a protracted delay, to coincide with today's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the right time to end a scheme that has worked so well. It could continue and the cost will not increase; we have the Government's own assurance on that. We are debating amendment No. 4 now, albeit briefly, prior to clause stand part. We are telling the Government that we feel so strongly on the issue and that the scheme has worked so well that we feel bound to push the amendment to a vote. Unlike amendment No. 3, which was a probing amendment, amendment No. 4 covers a matter that the Government should take

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
seriously and on which we feel even now they should still listen to logic and reason, as opposed to bigotry and prejudice, and agree with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr. John Butcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene at this stage to clear up one or two of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As agreed, we have made available the details of the Shipbuilding Redundancy Payments Scheme. They are tabled and are available to hon. Members if they wish to rehearse them and to reassure themselves of the workings of the scheme, which has changed not one iota from the way that it has operated in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me reassure the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West that the scheme is not being ended as a result of the Government's proposal. It is being extended by 18 months. Labour Members have misunderstood the purpose of clause 1(3) if they believe that it precludes further extensions of the redundancy payments scheme. It is part of the workings and the constitutional rights of the House that no legislation can bind subsequent legislators. Such a provision, if included in the Bill, would be entirely ineffective. However, the Government have said clearly that they do not wish to extend the scheme after December 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take up the hon. Gentleman's assertions. The two previous extensions of the scheme, in 1981 and 1983, both required primary legislation to amend the 1978 Act. We used the Industry Act in 1981 and the Shipbuilding Act in 1982. But the primary legislation in 1981 and 1982 also required that the extensions be made by a statutory instrument, a cumbersome procedure requiring a second debate on an affirmative resolution in the House. The Government therefore decided, for the convenience of the House, that the latest extension should be made directly by the primary legislation in the Bill. That is achieved by clause 1(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, accordingly, no need for any reference to a statutory instrument, and the references to orders in section 2(4) of the 1978 Act are now irrelevant. They are therefore repealed by clause 1(3) of the Bill, which is no more than a tidying-up measure. Its deletion would have no effect on the operation of the Bill, and would certainly not cause the Government to introduce legislation in 1986 to extend the schemes. The purpose of our methodology is to extend the scheme through a one-step rather than a two-step approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Labour Members still suspect that there is more in that approach than meets the eye, they will no doubt recall that it was used in the past primarily because we were not only discussing an extension. In the orders themselves, the structure of the schemes was being changed, enhanced or improved. Today we are proposing that the schemes should ride forward with exactly the same structure and benefits, and according to exactly the same calculations, as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now reassure the hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon), who made an important point in our last sitting about the cranking-up of the schemes in line with inflation or by whatever statutory method might
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
be required. The scheme is linked with the statutory scheme which works on a maximum-wage basis. If that maximum increases by a factor of one, this scheme will increase its maximum calculation by a factor of one and a half, as has always been the case. That, of course, adds to the generosity of the scheme. It is also linked with the level of wages in the shipbuilding industry, on which calculation of lump sums and weekly payments will of course depend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Labour Members are now assured that the method we have chosen is simpler, that it fulfils our purpose and that it makes life far more convenient not just for hon. Members but, most important of all, for the management and work force of British Shipbuilders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Dixon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Jarrow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To people outside, the fact that section 2(4) is to be taken out of the 1978 Act means that there will be no further extension of the redundancy scheme. The provision gives the Secretary of State the right to amend any scheme by substituting two years for four years, although he could substitute another figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the shipyards are saying that there has been a rush because the redundancy scheme is to stop, and that they should apply for their redundancies now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursday the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) referred to Second Reading when the Minister said that 35,000 people had benefited under the Act. I do not know how anyone benefits by being sacked and getting a few pounds—that is nonsense. It is like saying that everyone that Pierrepoint hanged benefited from the fact that the trap door always opened. That is the sort of thinking of Conservative Members and of the Minister on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister—I am not referring to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Trade and Industry, but the Minister of State—knows that there is no chance of these redundant people being reemployed, and that they are out of work for the rest of their lives. The skills that they have learnt over many years are lost to the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Swan Hunters announced 2,100 redundancies, many people volunteered not because they wanted to spend the rest of their lives on the human scrapheap but because newspaper articles had made them concerned that the Bill would stop redundancy payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can assure me that the shipbuilding redundancy scheme will continue, that will be some satisfaction to the men at Swan Hunters, as well as the management, who are concerned about the morale of the men. It is not good that 7,000 skilled workers who over the years have built some of the finest ships that sailed the ocean should suddenly ask to be thrown on the streets. It would help the management if the extension were to go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the amendment is to retain the provision in the 1978 Act so that it satisfies those in the industry that the Government have powers to extend the scheme at any time. Thus, possibly this time next year or later in the year when an extension is required—the Minister referred to a three-month period, which would be common sense—people would be satisfied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
that the extension was provided for in the Act. The threat of its removal caused much concern to those in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am partially reassured that it is Government policy to continue the shipbuilding redundancy scheme in a different form without using that provision. I welcome that statement, and I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) will take cognisance of it. However, we should like a categorical assurance that the scheme will be extended and not terminated. One of our amendments, which was not selected, suggested that the long title should include a reference to the termination of the redundancy payments scheme, and was prompted by clause 1. My hon. Friends would require that assurance before agreeing not to press amendment No. 4 to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister intended to say that. I think that he was trying to obfuscate the situation by referring to technical parliamentary procedures and that the Government indeed meant to terminate the scheme. The Minister implied that our amendment was technically deficient. No doubt parliamentary draftsmen would agree, but I think that my Hon. Friend should press the Minister, because as I understand him he is still saying that the Government will end the scheme in 1986, and that it will all be over for both the private sector and British Shipbuilders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, we shall vote on the amendment. It is up to my hon. Friend to decide on the merits or demerits of the amendment and of what the Government have said. But people in the shipbuilding industry are afraid that the scheme will be stopped, and, if the amendment is carried, it will certainly have at least a psychological effect, even if, as the Minister Says, it is obscure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Clay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sunderland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) has suggested, what the Minister has said is so "obfuscated" that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) have interpreted it slightly differently, it is hardly likely that the workers left in the shipbuilding industry will understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's last remarks were something of a curates egg. During our last sitting, we were told that the Government had no wish to end the redundancy scheme altogether, and that of course the industry would continue after 1986. But he went on to say that the Government had no wish to see the scheme last past the end of 1986. He also said that the clause that we wished to remove from the Bill would make no difference to the remainder of the Bill, which would still mean that the scheme could end in 1986. So now we are all fairly confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many kinds of legislation, but particularly in this instance, what really matters is what the workers understand it to mean, because it has an immediate effect on the real world. I do not know whether the Secretary of State and the Minister intended it, but there is a general feeling in the shipbuilding communities that the extension of the scheme to the end of 1986, but with the accompanying announcement
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
that the Government do not wish it to continue after that, signals the end of any redundancy scheme in British shipbuilding, and possibly the end of British Shipbuilders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of our last sitting, the Minister took me to task for suggesting that the Government wanted either to close down merchant shipbuilding or to privatise it. The Minister described both suggestions as horrific, and said that he hardly thought that I believed them myself. As he must know very well by now as it arose on Second Reading and on previous shipbuilding debates, my view of the Government's intentions is identical to that of the former chairman of British Shipbuilders, Sir Robert Atkinson, who was appointed by the Governemt It is hardly an alarmist or wild assertion to make when it is the same as the one made by the man who was chairman of British Shipbuilders less than a year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must clarify the situation. Without getting too bogged down in the legal jargon and terminology of the parliamentary meanings of these matters, he must spell out to the shipbuilding community what the Government's intention is from January 1987. Until the Minister can spell that out clearly and succinctly in language which shipbuilding communities can understand, the situation which my hon. Friend for Jarrow described will arise: because the scheme is coming to an end or because an even worse scheme will follow it people will decide to get out of the industry immediately. We have already seen many tragic examples of that, including one recently in my own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt British Shipbuilders will find 420 volunteers at Austin and Pickersgill. They will find them because that number of people in the year already feel that the future is too uncertain. The Government have been inactive for so long: so many orders have been on the brink of being achieved and have then been lost that workers feel that even if another possible order is on the horizon, no one can be certain how long it will last. There is constant speculation about how long their jobs will last and consequently, tragically, some people decide to get out of the industry rather than to agonise any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Government can give us an assurance about what will happen in January 1987 in clear terms that shipyard workers and Opposition Members can understand, the self-fulfilling prophecies and the vicious circle in the industry will continue. There will be more redundancies because workers will decide to get out now rather than wait in uncertainty until the end of next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has a disarmingly bland style which does not quite reassure us when he says that the removal of this section does not really mean what it appears to mean. Perhaps I am not following the argument, but removing the section from the Act appears at least to leave the enabling legislation within the Act. In other words, the scheme could be extended by a statutory instrument. However, the Government are saying that as they have no intention of extending it by order, they do no see any point in retaining that ability within the Act. In so doing they are undoubtedly ringing a clear alarm bell. Why do they feel the need to do it? The Minister has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
said, if I read the scheme correctly, that there may be a follow-on scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says no. The scheme would be non-statutory and self-financing. That is my understanding of what the Minister implies might come afterwards. In the present circumstances of British shipbuilding, how will that scheme be internally self-financing? What kind of scheme is it likely to be? The conclusion is that inevitably it will be a very much inferior scheme and therefore to all practical purposes, people within the industry as has already been pointed out, would be better to take the money and run now while a firm offer is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be clear about this. If he gives an assurance that there will be a scheme which is non-statutory but comparable, workers outside may be reassured, although they will ultimately only have the say so of the government, about which some of them may feel less confident. I would like the Minister to confirm that there will be a scheme and that it will be non-statutory and self-financing, an explain how, if that is the case, it can possibly compare with the present scheme. How, in those circumstances, can he be surprised that shipyard workers will seek to take the money while the present scheme I still available? Unless the Minister can answer that clearly, I shall certainly vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to put those questions perhaps more directly to the Minister. His opening remarks did not help us greatly. I am grateful to the official who gave me the text of section 2(4) of the primary legislation. It might be helpful if I read out the provisions it contains. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order amend any scheme under this Act".</p></blockquote>
We want him to retain that right. We believe that he is then committed to the scheme. But he is getting rid of that right and going even further. My hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) should not be misled by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary's flight of fancy when he says that the schemes ride forward as if on the crest of a wave of ever-growing confidence and expansion. They are in fact running out as the tide ebbs out, and he knows that perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause stand part we shall consider the alternatives. There is no question of the scheme being renewed. It is being hived off to the private sector for those shipyards which will be privatised. Heaven help them. We shall fight for them even though the Government will not. We shall probe as hard as we can to get the remaining shipyards the firmest commitment to the fullest scheme under the next debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said that the alternative order procedure was a cumbersome one. That is an extraordinary statement. Perhaps he would prefer a negative order, one which was merely tabled and then finished. An affirmative order is a most useful parliamentary instrument. What issues are more
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
important than the need to continue this redundancy scheme in areas of depression with up to 40 per cent. and 60 per cent. unemployment such as the East End ward in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland (Mr. Clay)? What should the House more urgently debate under a statutory instrument requiring a vote than such issues? It is altogether odd that the Minister should suggest that the amendment should not be carried because it merely seeks to perpetuate a cumbersome parliamentary procedure. It is neither cumbersome nor unnecessary. On the contrary, we want to see the scheme continued and therefore we want the Government to retain the rights they currently have. Those rights are clearly spelled out in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary says that it meets the Government's purpose to eliminate section 2(4). Of course it meets their purpose. Their purpose is to get rid of the state scheme. Their purpose is to reduce the cost of the redundancies which they must foresee. However, their proposal is illogical, in that they are almost committed to a similar scheme for British Shipbuilders after the passage of this legislation. Moreover, the argument that it is simpler for management employees to administer the scheme defies all logic, because we understood from the Minister at our last sitting that they intended to spend their time negotiating redundancy procedures or working out how to get themselves privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we hear the Under-Secretary's eagerly awaited reply to those points, may I ask him to clarify one aspect? I am grateful for the information that I received from his officials, although the part that I wanted has been torn off the bottom of the page. However, we make no complaint about that, pending the abolition of the Official Secrets Acts, because we realise that we cannot be privy to the innermost thinking and powerful analyses of officials and Ministers. I should add in all sincerity that they deserve our great respect.

The information tells us, in relation to section 2(4), that if it is any way spent, the amendment has no direct effect in practice. Does that mean if there is no money left, or does it mean if it is spent in time? If it means the latter, clearly it is relevant, because we want the Minister to retain the ability to increase the time that he says is spent. We devoted a lot of time at our last sitting to debating why the amount of time spent could well be extended further. However, it may mean that there is no more money and that there is plenty of time to get the money for this scheme as foreseen in the White Paper and in the Department of Trade and Industry, and as foreseen for British Shipbuilders itself. After all, the civilian side of that organisation will remain, and 11,000 people will remain in the public sector. So I hope that the Minister will tell us what is meant by the fact that if spent, the amendment has no direct effect in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential issue here, as the Minister will appreciate, is that the money resolution is extremely tightly drawn. We have not unduly strayed from our endeavour to discover why the Government want to shuffle off their direct responsibility in this respect. Our amendment may not be perfect; indeed, one has rarely seen a technically perfect Opposition amendment. We table probing amendments to obtain

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
information in an effort to fathom the Government's thinking. In other amendments we make a direct point, and amendment No. 4 is such an amendment. In it we are saying to the Government, 'We do not believe that you should end the scheme. We do not believe you should shuffle off responsibility by flogging off the profitable yards to the private sector and making British Shipbuilders work on its own redundancy scheme.' We believe that the state scheme should persist, and the purpose of amendment No. 4 was to make that quite clear. We shall therefore press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's oberservations, and perhaps it will help the Committee if I restate in plain English the import of this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to make it clear that we are talking about an 18-month extension on the shipbuilding redundancy payments scheme, after which it is not the Government's intention further to extend the scheme. From that point on, given the extra time that in this legislation we shall deliver to the management of British Shipbuilders and its subsequent discussions with the work force, the scheme has to be replaced by a non-statutory scheme, subject to those negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Minister of State pointed out that he had written to the corporate management of Harland and Wolff, and to British Shipbuilders, asking them to use the time to negotiate an appropriate successor scheme. As Opposition Members have signalled, we may wish to consider that further in a subsequent debate. But if the amendment was accepted, it would create an anomalous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the sole consideration in proposing to give direct effect to the extension by clause 1(2) rather than make yet another amendment to section 2(4) of the 1978 Act was the convenience of the House. To introduce the Bill first and then when it became law, to introduce under it an order subject to affirmative resolution whose sole effect was to make the desired extension would have been seen as a very cumbersome and, some might argue, time-wasting procedure. It would be far more convenient to all concerned if the extension could take direct effect under the primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish, because I think that I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's point if I am allowed to continue? Had we wished to amend the schemes comprising the orders, we might have acted differently, but at this stage we do not wish to make such amendments. Whatever procedure we chose to adopt, the effect would have been the same. The extensions under the Industry Act 1981 and the Shipbuilding Act 1982 each authorised, subject to an order being made, one two-year extension and no more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, amendment No. 4 would fail to achieve the objectives of its sponsors. It would achieve nothing except perhaps to cause confusion. It would leave on the statute book two apparently inconsistent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
provisions—one under section 2(4) giving the scheme a life of eight years, and the other under the present Bill, giving the scheme a life of nine years and six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the provision being spent, as I am sure the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) fully understands, it is not that there is no money, but that, in the words of John Cleese, it would become a 'duff, ex-clause'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. But all this technical obfuscation by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary seems almost due to a need to filibuster early in the debate. He has merely said that the amendment is not technically perfectly, as we readily concede, but we have some difficulty with amendments to this Bill, for reasons which the Minister is extremely well aware. Amendment No. 4 simply proposes that rather than scrap it altogether now, we should keep the right to renew the scheme on the same day on a rolling basis until security and a future for the industry is in prospect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made the position very clear in my opening observations. Even if we went along the track used in the past and the clause were not spent, we would need to come back to the House with primary legislation. As I said, no law can constitutionally bind the workings of subsequent laws, so one would need to come back with primary legislation, anyway, if one wished to take the shipbuilding redundancy payments scheme beyond 18 months. With the one-step procedure proposed, that 18-month extension can be secured, after which the non-statutory scheme can take effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that advice, Sir Paul. I think that we should have a clause stand part debate, because wider issues arise as the Under-Secretary attempted yet again to make clear in his concluding sentences when he said that the non-statutory scheme could come into effect. It is not a question of could or can come into effect; the Bill makes it clear that it "will" take effect. The Bill's

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
intention is to scrap the statutory scheme that everyone agreed has worked so well. If the Minister wishes to introduce what he is abolishing by the legislation, of course it will require primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary wanted to extend the scheme and if it required statutory legislation, as he assures us it does for the technically sound but complicated reasoning he gave us, I can say on behalf of my hon. Friends, and perhaps even speaking for the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), that he would have our wholehearted support. Far from a cumbersome statutory instrument, if he wanted to bring primary legislation forward again to cover 11,000 people and make that an obligatory requirement also on those yards that had been privatised, we would accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are getting rid of a scheme that the Under-Secretary acknowleged has worked well and of which the Minister of State spoke in glowing terms on Second Reading. So why get rid of the scheme? The only reply we get is that British Shipbuilders is to continue a scheme of its own. We are assured that arrangement for that scheme are already well under way. Negotiations are taking place between the Department and BS. We have it on record that the Department has already written to the chairman of British Shipbuilders, Mr. Graham Day, asking him to bring forward proposals. Presumably, as with the corporate plan of BS, the chairman will have to agree those proposals with the Department for the continuation of a BS redundancy scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we have sight of that letter, or is it secret? We should like to be assured that we are entering into a most-favoured nation arrangement at least as good as what was there before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also like to know what undertakings the Government are intent on getting from the private sector for the yards that are privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are strongly led by market forces except, of course, when it comes to the pound; there we have yet to see whether the Prime Minister believes more strongly in market forces, or in herself in resisting them. But, when the yards are hived off, surely the least that could be asked of the private sector in return for the writing off of debts under clause 2 is that it should retain certain liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that those liabilities will not be financial. That tidying up of the balance sheets in clause 2 is typical of the Government, and it is essential if they are to dispose of the profitable military yards. I remind the Under-Secretary, however, of what was said in the Trade and Industry Select Committee about the effect of hiving off the warship yards, and their subsequent falling out of the shipbuilding redundancy scheme, on the survival of the rest of British Shipbuilders and, by extension, on the likelihood of redundancies in what will remain of the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was said by Mr. Nichols, the managing partner of Arthur Young, was endorsed by Mr. Dornton, the partner responsible for the audit of British Shipbuilders, and also by Mr. Darby, chairman of Arthur Young. Mr. Nichols said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect that it will have"</p></blockquote>
that is, selling off the military yards
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"is that whereas in the past the warship building activity has consistently made profits of the order of £40—£50 million per annum, in future, once warship building has been the subject of privatisation, those profits will be out with the accounts of British Shipbuilders. Therefore, that credit which has in the past served to reduce the operating losses of British Shipbuilders will not in future be within these accounts."</p></blockquote>
No one needs to be an accounting genius to understand that argument. In simple terms, it proves what we have consistently said about the present Government that, according to them, profitable concerns should be flogged off regardless of the cost, both in financial terms and in terms of social destruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a balance sheet is cleaned up and made attractive, and the private sector is offered yards making £40 million to £50 million a year in profits, is it not right to insist in the name of social responsibility that undertakings be given to the work force which is being handed over without consultation to new owners? If we tell British Shipbuilders that the scheme will remain essentially the same, should we not tell the companies waiting to pick up profitable Government business, "You too, shall retain this scheme, on at least as advantageous a basis as that which previously existed"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said on Second Reading that the Government would say that to British Shipbuilders. The Under-Secretary also gave an undertaking during our last debate, and we shall not let him wriggle out of it, although he may squirm a bit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, at this stage there is no need to worry that the work forces may end up worse off."[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, c. 793.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, the work forces in the public sector would continue to be covered by the British Shipbuilders scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only possible caveat in that otherwise categorical statement is "at this stage". I am not sure what it means. It may mean that we should forget about it for this debate, and that we can have another debate and argument later. Such a way of proceeding would not be worthy of the Minister and certainly not of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we may assume that the contents of the lettter written by the Department to the chairman of British Shipbuilders are consistent with the undertaking given by the Minister of State and repeated by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in our previous sitting, we may also assume, logically and fairly, that the letter must say, "You will continue the scheme to all intents and purposes as we have continued it on a statutory basis." I should like the Under-Secretary's clear and precise confirmation of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, when the scheme ends, there will be full equality between the public and the private sector."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, c.8361.]</p></blockquote>
If there is to be full equality between the public and the private sectors, the private sector should have the same redundancy scheme as the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the public sector will have the same scheme as the shipbuilding redundancy scheme, what is all the argument about? The logic of the case seems
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
inescapable. We need not debate this at all, but simply keep the scheme running. The legislation already exists to impose undertakings in writing on those yards. It follows that we ask of those companies that are to buy the warship yards that they sign a piece of paper to the effect that they will abide by the statutory provisions of the shipbuilding redundancy scheme, which, for convenience's sake, should continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an unequivocal confirmation of that from the Minister, and an explanation—if there can be one—of what he understands by "full equality". It may be that he has other meanings in mind. To me, "full equality" must include equality of redundancy provisions and the liability of commitment towards that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Under-Secretary at his word when he says that he cares about the employees who are subject to the changes in shipbuilding, the car industry, and the motor cycle industry, of which we have seen the sad demise. It is only worthy of him that they should be treated as generously as possible. The hardship and pain to individuals in the community should be eased in ways suited to their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that "voluntary" meant only if the managers decided that they no longer needed someone. Therefore, he must admit that the ending of the scheme and the uncertainty that surrounds it is bound to create even more uncertainty in all the yards, the warship yards as well as the civilian ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those hon. Members who represent the constituencies that include shipbuilding interests which have such a desperate struggle to survive—especially my hon. Friend the Members for Jarrow and for Sunderland, North—have argued that the uncertainty could do further damage to the industry and so could jeopardise what we all wish to see—the survival of a fine, expanding, commercial and military shipbuilding capacity. The Under-Secretary says that we are being unduly pessimistic. But it is quite clear from what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett), who unfortunately has sent his apologies for the early stages of the Committee, that we are not being pessimistic when we look round and see what has happened to manufacturing industry under this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are the realists. That is why we are pressing so hard for the undertakings that we have requested. One concerns the voluntary nature of redundancy, its restrictive aspect and the inevitable mad rush there will be to get in as soon as possible because of the uncertainty that there is to follow. It is amazing that when we are debating this issue we have not been told what the successor scheme is to be. We could save hours of debate if we knew that. If the Government knew that they were to abolish the scheme, why have they not tabled the successor scheme? If the officials have it with them, and I can read it quickly, perhaps—if my hon. Friends agree—we can terminate the whole clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be something unacceptable and unpalatable about the successor scheme. That can be the only sound reason why it is not in front of us. In the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
past I have, unfortunately, had occasion to tell employees that there were to be redundancies. We know that industries cannot always escape recessions or the sudden emergence of a new technology or product in a different part of the world. But if I went to my employees, and used the immemorable words of the Minister of State on 9 January, and said "Don't worry, you'll be alright, there is a successor scheme," they would say, "All right where is it?" If I told them that we were working on it, they would just laugh at me. To say that the new scheme will be as good as the old one is not a serious proposition to put to the Committee or to the House
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough. It is in bad faith to put forward such a proposition. It would be accepted by no serious trade union. The Under-Secretary and Conservative Members might understand better if we talked of management. Let us suppose one said to a manager, "Look, old boy, we are going to change your job specification. Don't worry, you will still have your company car, your free petrol, and you can take Charles out to lunch every Thursday as you have in the past. We won't look too closely at the bill that comes in every Friday night. Those things will go on as before, but since you are changing jobs we have to tear up your present contract." The chap would say, "Yes that's fine, I love your reassurances, I am even attracted by the new job but," he will say, "where is the new contract?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary were to rise to his feet now and say, "There's the new scheme, have a look at it," we would do so. The truth is that this method of proceding is not worthy of the Under-Secretary. It is not worthy of the Government, or Mr. Graham Day of British Shipbuilders, or of the Department—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the continuation of the Labour Government's scheme is unworthy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are debating is not the continuance of the Labour Government's scheme, but the end of its statutory basis in December 1986. If the Under-Secretary will say that it will continue after 1986, we will all sit down. But he is not saying that. He is saying that the scheme will end in December 1986. It will then be hived off to a new scheme in the British Shipbuilders which will be as good as a statutory scheme, but the Government cannot tell us anything about it because they have yet not worked it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary does not understand. This is not a serious proposition. If he were to put it to a trade union, its members would walk out and laugh in his face as a manager. If he said to a fellow director that he would get rid of a scheme that suited him well, for example a pension scheme, saying, "Don't worry, old boy, you will get a pension scheme that is just as good," the chap would say, "Give me the new scheme and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
then tear up the old one." Can the Under-Secretary not understand that? That is why we are here putting those questions to him. Why does he not table the new scheme? The present scheme will end in December 1986. Am I correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, that scheme will be as good as the state scheme. Am I correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make my own contribution to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we have it. That is why we have no details of the scheme today. The Under-Secretary does not have them, he will not give that categorical undertaking and we know that the Government are rushing through the new scheme before we can see it. No doubt it will be much worse than or, in some respects, not as good as the scheme that is being replaced. The Under-Secretary does himself no justice by equivocating in that way. However, given that we cannot have what we want and are left in limbo in this way, we must table probing amendments because of the tightness of the money resolution and put questions to the Under-Secretary that should have been answered by making available to us details of the new scheme for British Shipbuilders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read a briefing about what will arise with the ending of the scheme. I believe that its origins are in Newcastle, where the county council has a deep interest and concern in those matters. I should like the Under-Secretary to comment on the briefing which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems likely that the redundancies sought by British Shipbuilders will only be achieved by the adoption of compulsory redundancy procedures which contravene the terms of the Blackpool Agreement—a formal agreement for the restructuring of the industry signed by management and the shipbuilding unions in 1979."</p></blockquote>
There is no need for me to table the Blackpool agreement, because officials and those of my hon. Friends who follow those matters so closely will know it only too well. However, there is a statement to that effect from Newcastle county council. As the Under-Secretary cannot tell us what the new scheme will involve, as he has made quite clear, he might at least take this opportunity—I shall pass him the precise wording if that will help him—to give us a categorical assurance that the worries of Newcastle county council—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tyne and Wear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—Tyne and Wear council are unnecessary. I believe that it would be received in Tyne and Wear with a great deal of welcome, but I hasten to add, in view of his previous equivocation, with a great deal of scepticism as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to pursue the mechanism of the scheme and how it will operate, because I do not regard myself
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
as being as proficient in those matters as my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow, who has a lifetime's experience of the industry. He has seen it collapse from being a world leader to a position where, even on the latest corporate plan of 200,000 tonnes per annum, it will represent perhaps 1.5 to 2 per cent. of world shipbuilding output.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary gets on his high horse and becomes indignant when we cast doubt on the ability of the civilian, non-military, shipbuilding industry to survive. Buit when one considers the rate at which it has declined and the 1984–85 plan of British Shipbuilders for 1987–88, in which there is a commitment on merchant shipbuilding core capacity—some core at 200,000 tonnes or 1.5 per cent.—it seems at least a legitimate question to pose. Are the Government prepared to support the industry at that level and what level of subsidy will be required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems strange that the Government should be shuffling off their responsibility for supporting redundancy costs while, at the same time, telling us nothing about their willingness to support, with subsidy if necessary, the core capacity of 200,000 tonnes per annum. I believe that it is a throughput of approximately 160,000 tonnes per annum support. One has only to think about the reality and not the pessimism of the position to realise that there must be grave doubts about many yards. I do not wish to name particular yards—we do not want to create uncertainty but it prevails in virtually all of them. We have not created that uncertainty—we are attempting to remove it. One way of doing that is to get rid of the legislation that we are discussing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Under-Secretary expect us to be reassured by his statements that there will be a big shipbuilding industry? The plan drawn up by Graham Day in 1984–85 for the years 1987–88 proposes 200,000 tonnes, but the previous plan of a year or two before proposed 400,000 tonnes. If we continue in that way there will be bad prospects for British civilian shipbuilding. It is made all the worse when reading the evidence of those who understand the finances of the industry, such as auditors and senior partners of Arthur Young and Co, who say that British Shipbuilders can no longer rely on the contribution from military business. We are not forcing the uncertainty and confusion—the Minister is doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek undertakings from the private sector equal to those in the public sector regarding its social responsibility towards the employees that they will be taking over. With regard to the mechanisms, my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow will be raising those matters with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not only reassurance that there will be a continuation of a scheme at least as good as the present SRS shipbuilding redundancy scheme, but a maritime policy and a regional policy to cover those areas which are so dependent on shipbuilding. I shall not stray to discussions of regional policy, but the matter is relevant because the abolition of the statutory scheme will create uncertainty and a rush for redundancies. In the next two years we shall see an even sharper increase in unemployment in the regions that can least afford it, such as the north east, Merseyside and Clydeside. Each has its own specific regional problems in addition to the industry problems.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
Perhaps the Secretary of State could make a dramatic comeback and write to Mr. Graham Day to say that British Steel has had remarkable success and even the NCB has been prodded into doing something for the communities that will be affected by pit closures. So, if British shipbuilders agreed that because of the uncertainty and increase in redundancies envisaged, it would help to establish the equivalent of British Steel Industries Ltd, for example, it would get financial help. If the money existed, a fund could be set up and administered by a senior executive who cared about such matters—there may already be such a person in British Shipbuilders. It could be administered in the same way as the BSC has done in helping Corby. We would see that the Government were concerned and it could allay the fears and dampen the rush that there is bound to be towards increased redundancies that will follow from this legislation. It would have the effect of abating the rush for redundancy and the lack of certainty among shipbuilding employees. That would be something positive from this Government of negative ideas.

I spoke elsewhere of a policy of nihilism. The Government want only to cut or abolish. That is not good enough for those areas which historically have made such a contribution to the country. They pioneered the industrial revolution and made great contributions to the war effort in two world wars and, more recently, to the Falklands campaign. It must be evident, even to the Under-Secretary, that the loss of, I believe, 200 ships in the period since the Government came to office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Paul. I shall relate my comment to the clause because it arises directly from it. We must avoid redundancies and the cost to the Exchequer. Redundancies will arise from the abolition of this scheme because there will be uncertainty in the shipyards as a result. People will rush to take redundancy, which will exacerbate the situation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
in the region. The scheme could be modified, reduced or better managed if the Government had a policy. My remarks are directly relevant because, if taken as part of a whole policy, and with the assurance that it will continue within British Shipbuilders, the scheme could become a manageable proposition and prevent a haemorrhage of skills from an industry which might die on its feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two or three elements in a maritime strategy which could avoid such circumstances arising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend says is true. The 1978 redundancy scheme was bought in for a deal with the first corporate plan for British Shipbuilders. That was based on a throughput of almost 400,000 tons. When the Select Committee on Trade and Industry examined British Shipbuilders' plans in 1981, it proposed, in recommendation No. 6, a maritime policy for this country with a Minister to deal with it. My hon. Friend's remarks are relevant to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As he knows much of what I am saying now arises directly from my discussions with him. I have drawn heavily on his deep knowledge of the shipbuilding industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put points to the Under-Secretary for consideration within a strategy related to minimising these redundancies to maintain the core capacity which the Government promise, despite the abolition of the scheme. There should be a plan for shipbuilding involving a rolling programme for naval shipbuilding requirements and the military side of the business. The Government should be willing to lean on British companies to buy British. We have the worst record of any country in respect of British companies buying British ships. Consider the pressure that had to be exerted in respect of the Atlantic Conveyor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could lean on companies—they have purchasing powers in other directions and the ability to subsidise—to ensure that ships are built in the United Kingdom. The Government could also legislate on such issues as the merchant fleet to ensure that the conditions and terms of our merchant fleet, that played such a noble role in the Falklands war, were acceptable to the sailors in that fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows the argument surrounding the retention of an engineering building facility in the United Kingdom and the expert advice that came from all over the country against the proposal to close a certain facility I shall not go into that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister took those five points and gave the Committee a plan for the industry as a whole, we believe that the present redundancy position could be coped with and that we could sustain the scheme, whether statutory or not. All we have had so far from the Minister is one totally negative strategy. Perhaps he will tell us something about a wider strategy, and I am keen to hear his reply to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the clause would terminate the scheme, I wish to press the Minister harder on the subject of what is likely to happen thereafter. During our previous discussion, it was said that the present statutory scheme would be succeeded by a non-statutory scheme and the implication—if not the statement—was that it would be self-financed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) said that the new scheme, which will not be a statutory one, will have to be financed by a much reduced British Shipbuilders which will have lost the profitable warship yards. One is therefore forced to the conclusion that British Shipbuilders will be in an even weaker position to finance the scheme than now and that without an undertaking from the Government to top up the scheme it is bound to be inferior. The Minister should clarify the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to an exchange that he had with me last Thursday when I raised the problem of an employee who had sought redundancy under the present scheme but was turned down by his employers because he was a key worker and not in a category that they wished to release.
	<br><blockquote><p>"If he works in a yard after 1986 which remains within British Shipbuilders ownership, it too, we hope, will have in place a successor to this scheme. "—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 24 January 1985; c.29.]</p></blockquote>
That was not the firm assurance that the Minister of State gave on Second Reading when he said that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"will have in place, we hope, the successor to this scheme."</p></blockquote>
If we are not to have a rush to try and secure benefits under the existing scheme, the Minister must come up with more than a hope and must tell us how, in the circumstances that I have described, it is conceivable, without any Government undertaking, that British Shipbuilders could possibly operate a comparable scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may wish to tell the Committee whether he feels that the warship yards so privatised and able to benefit from the profits of taxpayers' expenditure on those yards should not be able to run an even better scheme than that which the Government propose to wind up at the end of 1986. It is relevant that the Government have within their direct control, in the Ministry of Defence budget, the capability to do more to secure employment within British yards by phasing orders more coherently and ensuring that yards are given contracts for a time that helps to meet the industry's requirements rather than just the requirements of the Minister of Defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence on such defence contracts should be closer and more coherent than it is. Our competiters in the shipbuilding industry have a more coherent policy that is more apparent. We read of difficulties for shipbuilding in Sweden. In this context, Sweden has the handicap of being a neutral nation that does not have the same sort of defence budget on which to draw. I therefore appeal to the Department of Trade and Industry to do more to improve the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stated objective, which implies a core of employment to build '200,000 gross tonnes for British Shipbuilders, is nothing more than a figure out of the air and does not tell us much about the kind of tonnage or shipbuilding strategy, or the strategic core of shipbuilding capability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my main concern in this debate is to press the Minister much harder to give a more positive assurance on three matters. First, how can the proposed scheme possibly be comparable to the present scheme, given
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
the likely state of British Shipbuilders when the scheme comes into effect? Secondly, will the Government undertake to ensure that the scheme will be in place by the due date and not be merely a matter of hope, as was said in Committee last week? Thirdly, given the Bill that the Government are now pushing through, will the Government undertake, if necessary, to bring forward legislation to top up the scheme if it falls too far short and we still face decimated communities that are substantially dependent on an industry that is continuing to decline?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have not been able to come up with a coherent strategy to arrest that decline, they have no moral right to withdraw the scheme and leave communities with no industries, no alternative employment and no support for individuals who, through no fault of their own, are left in that situation. The Minister must answer that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the correct procedure for voting on the clause. I appreciate that the Labour party says that it will vote against it, but, if we vote against the clause, we are voting against the extension. We have already said that we would rather have a more open-ended arrangement than one that did not involve the termination of the scheme. Nevertheless, as I am not sure about voting against the clause, I hope that it will not be pressed to a Division</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may have wondered, Sir Paul, why I was so unusually reticent about rising to my feet this morning, apart from the modesty that I possess in great quantities. The other reason is that the last people to build a ship in Paisley—apart from a few dredgers—were the Vikings. I shall come to dredgers in a minute, as that important industry was lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming to this House, I was the head of social services in Strathclyde and in that capacity my staff and I frequently had to pick up the human flotsam created by the misery and degradation of unemployment. Many of the unemployed in that area had formerly worked in the Clyde shipyards. At one time, we had 23 shipyards on Clydeside. Today we have three, and over the past half century between 40,000 and 50,000 people have probably lost jobs in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demise of the shipbuilding industry is almost comparable to that of the textile industry, where 20,000 were once employed and where today there are 1,000. There are probably no more than 3,000 or 4,000 left in the Clydeside shipbuilding industry. Men came to my office who had built ships all their lives—men in their forties and fifties who, when they lost their jobs, had nowhere to go except the scrap-heap. They were the men who built the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth, the men from Yarrow and the south Clyde yards who built the ships that defeated Admiral Doenitz and kept this country free. But, my goodness! There was damned little reward for them when they reached their fifties and sixties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make my remarks more pertinent to the Bill for the Minister's benefit. Not only are the Government throwing people on to the scrap-heap, but they now want to reduce the value of the scrap-heap as well. When all the talk is finished and all the statistics have been trotted out, can anyone put hand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
on heart and say that the Bill improves the lot of the working man who is about to lose his job? Will it give him more money, more security or a more prosperous future? Does it add anything to the total of human happiness on Tyneside, Clydeside or anywhere else where once ships were once built and where now, as a result of the Government's policy, nothing is built?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is clearly no. The Bill is just another of the mean-minded, spiteful bits of legislation which have come from the Government in the past four or five years, and which spell out the clear message: "We do not like working people, and we do not give a damn about the northern English and the Scots, because they do not vote for us." We have a regional problem up there: it is called the southern English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a short-sighted piece of attempted legislation. It is also mean and vindictive, but that does not surprise me. As I have said, Government policy over the past few years has been mean and vindictive. While we could stand here all day debating the Bill 	<i>ad nauseam,</i> we all know that the Government have a majority and that the Opposition will lose the vote. I remember the words of the late President Franklin Roosevelt: "Don't get mad—get even!". But, no matter how long we talk in Committee, we will not get even.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am as angry about the legislation as anyone else. I am incensed when I see the suffering and misery caused in my constituency by such policies. But my solution is not to talk about it here, but to go out and knock on doors throughout the country in the hope of putting an end to it at the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another manifestation of the Government's short-sighted strategies. The only connection that my constituency had with shipbuilding was in dredging, a very specialised area. Most of the dredgers which cleard the Zuider Zee and the low countries were built at Fleming and Ferguson's in Paisley. That company no longer exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British dredging industry is kaput, and every dredger in the world that I know of was built in Holland. Again, that is typical of the Government's policy. If the Government had put a quid or two into the British dredger-building industry 20 years ago, they would have saved it. Now it costs a hundred time more to buy the dredgers which we need than it did before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An industry has been lost. For the want of a shoe the horse was lost, for the want of a horse the battle was lost, and for the want of winning that battle the war was lost. That is exactly what is wrong with the Government's thinking, not only in the shipbuilding industry but in the car industry in my area which went down the river for the same reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shipyards on the Clyde needed massive investment 20 or 30 years ago. As I am sure my hon. Friends who know more about shipbuilding than I do can confirm, because of the tonnage sunk during the war there was a boom in shipbuilding in 1945. A lot of money was made on the Clyde by people renewing cargo vessels and naval vessels. Scott-Lithgow in Greenock, Yarrow, Simon-Lobnitz and Fairfields made a fortune at that time. Yet those yards were out of date when I there. The Japanese would have laughed at them. They would not have attempted to build a canoe in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
The working people were blamed for that. But it was nothing to do with discriminatory practices; it was to do with greedy people. They made a lot of money between 1945 and 1955, and, instead of ploughing the money back into industry to enable it to compete with Germany, Sweden and Japan, they put it into their wallets and walked away. Ten years later, time caught up with them, the yards could not compete, and subsequently they shut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of yards on the Clyde has dropped from 23 to three, and of those three Yarrow exists basically on Government naval contracts. Scott-Lithgow has been sold off and the workforce has been reduced to about 1,200, or 1,800 at the most. So even the yards which are left are not in a very competitive position. By bringing forward legislation such as this, the Government are making matters all that more uncertain for the few people who are left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were an investor abroad listening to the nonsense being uttered by the Government, I would have many thoughts about whether to invest money in the British shipbuilding industry. Instead of the line which he is taking, the Minister should state categorically that the Government will back up British shipbuilding, will direct naval orders to British yards exclusively, and will encourage the commercial purchaser to buy from British yards. No Minister gives that sort of commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication by the Government is that redundancies are inevitable. We should be arguing that redundancies are not necessary. It adds insult to injury for the Government to admit implicitly, by discussing the matter, that they will go along with us but then for the Minister to say that redundant workers are getting too much money and he wants to take it away. It is mean-minded beyond belief. I appeal to the Minister to change his mind, although I think that my appeal will fall on deaf ears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 stops the shipbuilding redundancy scheme. Workers outside the shipbuilding industry, in the steel works and dock labour schemes and even those mineworkers who today were having talks about talks about talks, should watch carefully what is happening here, because British Shipbuilders will be the first nationalised industry to terminate a redundancy scheme. What is happening to the employees of British Shipbuilders today could be happening to the mineworkers this time next year when the Government feel themselves in a stronger position than they are today, and when that carrot has gone by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been said by the Minister of State and by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary which has given grave doubts to Opposition Members. For example, the Minister of State said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By the end of 1986 the state will own less than one third of the United Kingdom industry. Moreover, if it is to survive, the remaining merchant shipbuilding sector will by then have had to fight its way back to a competitive position and to have found a level of reasonable stability. The need and justification for the scheme will thus have passed".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, col. 7931.]</p></blockquote>
The final sentence
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The need and justification for the scheme will thus have passed",</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
is welcome to everyone. If the Government could guarantee that those in the shipbuilding industry had employment for future years, no one would be concerned about the redundancy scheme, because the scheme was brought in to give employees a slight financial cushion against being thrown out of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government can talk about reasonable stability, but at present the only reasonable stability likely is a situation with no shipbuilding, because Graham Day is an unmitigated disaster. His is possibly the worst appointment ever made in a nationalised industry. His brief was to cut the shipbuilding industry virtually to zero. From what we have seen up to now, he has succeeded. When the Minister says that by the end of December 1986 the state will own less than one third of the United Kingdom industry, I am reminded of the advertisements for bulbs that promise 30 per cent. more light but do not say what the 30 per cent. is of; or for tyres that give 50 per cent. more grip without saying what the 50 per cent. is of. When the Minister talks of one third of the industry, we want to know what the one third is of—is it one third of building one ship, or one third of building 100 ships?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in the same debate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Compensation for that was the subject of negotiation."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; vol. 70, col. 796]</p></blockquote>
He was referring to the Tyne Shiprepair Group Ltd. and Scott Lithgow. As I said to the Under-Secretary on Thursday, there was no negotiation with Tyne Shiprepairers. Indeed, when Mr. Abbott and his colleague, directors of British Shipbuilders at the time, were negotiating to buy Tyne Shiprepairers, Mr. Abbott contacted me and my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) and asked for a meeting because the men in Tyne Shiprepairers were not too keen on the plans that those two characters had for the company. They were already directors under the state scheme, and the workers were asking how, if they had been such failures under the nationalised scheme, they could make a success with the privatised company. The men were not particularly keen, either, on the terms and conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and I met Mr. Abbott and Mr. Parker, who is, I believe, at Sunderland Shipbuilders at present. We talked to those two gentlemen, and they put it to us that we should have a word with the men and use our influence to get them to accept the terms. I told Mr. Abbott and Mr. Parker that the men would not be bought out of the shipbuilding scheme, and that they would not accept the terms offered, which were one weeks instead of two weeks' pay for every one years' employment. I said that the least that the men would accept was the present redundancy scheme. Mr. Abbott and Mr. Parker said that they had been told by the Government that the terms were not negotiable. How then can the Minister say that compensation is subject to negotiation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is like today's talks, when the Government say to MacGregor, "Go in there without any predetermined ideas, but you mustn't do this and you mustn't do that." That is the sort of nonsense that we have had in the shipbuilding industry. It is not true that those issues can be negotiated without instructions from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Redundancy payments were brought up in the first instance because of the cut in the labour force when the shipyards were nationalised in 1977. The first corporate plan meant a certain number of redundancies and a throughput of 400,000 tonnes a year. That was first envisaged under the chairmanship of Sir Robert Atkinson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Shipbuilders came nearest to breaking even when it came within £19 million of its target with a throughput of 400,000 tonnes. With the overheads and facilities to maintain the corporation is not having the throughput that it envisaged—Graham Day is now talking of a throughput of less than 200,000 tonnes, so obviously it will fall short of the Government's figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that we have considered is why warship yards make a profit and merchant shipyards make a loss. The same men work on both. When I worked at Swan Hunter, I could work on a warship one day, and a merchant ship another day. I did not run along the gangway on the warship and stroll along it on the merchant ship, and the men were exactly the same. Therefore, we should be asking why one is making a profit and not the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is that the merchant ships are in an international market. They are losing business because other countries are deliberately subsidising their industries. The men in Vosper Thornycroft work no harder than the men at Swan Hunter, yet Swan Hunter showed a loss and Vosper Thornycroft showed a profit last year—they are working on the warships. It is about time that someone paid attention to that. The lack of shipbuilding orders is due to the international market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) mentioned the number of ship orders that have been lost. Every day we are losing more and more merchant ship orders and fewer of those available are being placed in this country. It is a pity that British shipowners do not take a leaf out of the books of their colleagues overseas and place a few more orders with British shipyards. They have the worst record in Europe for placing orders in our shipyards. If they acted like the Japanese shipowners, we would not have our present problems, as they place all their orders in their own country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a point about negotiations. On Thursday, the Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman need not fear that workers, who after 1986 are either in the private sector or in the post-1986 regime public sector, will be bushwacked or surprised by some draconian reduction in the provision made for them. It will be entirely a matter for the new employers or British Shipbuilders itself after 1986 to put together whatever package is agreeable to the unions and which serves the interests of the company or British Shipbuilders best."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, 24 January 1985; c.30.]</p></blockquote>
The point is that our shipbuilders have no national redundancy scheme at present. If we are to have some sort of equilibrium between the private and public yards, the public yards will lose the shipbuilding redundancy scheme; it is as simple as that. Scott Lithgow and Tyne Ship Repairers are now out of the scheme. Their employers received compensation of only about one third of what it should have been. The shop stewards at Tyne Shiprepair Group Ltd. made a survey of the number of men who would be retained under the new management. They calculated that if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
everyone received his redundancy pay as laid out in the shipbuilding redundancy scheme of 1983 it would cost about £10.7 million. But the offfer made by the company to buy the workers out of the scheme amounted to only £4.5 million; therefore £6.2 million was saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt about this, and the men in the yards realise it—the shipbuilding redundancy scheme will be ended; after December 1986 it will cease to exist, and workers in the industry will receive only their state redundancy pay. In other words, they will lose out despite all their sacrifices. That is why so many men are volunteering for redundancy at present, and it has an effect on the morale both of those working in the yards and on the managements. If there had been an intention by the Government to have another scheme—although it would not have been statutory—after 1986, the present arrangements could have been continued past that date and people could have had the chance of comparing them. That would also have allowed for an easy transference from one scheme to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quoted from the comments of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last Thursday. But how can agreement be possible if it
	<br><blockquote><p>"serves the interests of the company or British Shipbuilders best"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, 24 January 1985; c.30.]</p></blockquote>
without reference being made to the employees; they are the whole purpose of having a redundancy scheme? I believe that the Minister's comment proved and underlined the fact that the scheme will inevitably be inferior.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. Indeed, the two tests that we have seen to date, at Scott Lithgow and Tyne Shiprepairs, show that negotiations with the new owners have led to schemes that are inferior to the shipbuilding redundancy scheme. As someone else said, there is no need to look into the crystal ball when one can read the book. In those two examples, the yards were taken over and the work force finished up with a worse scheme than the present one. What the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said is perfectly true: shipyard workers will lose out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that we are discussing the termination of the shipbuilding redundancy scheme. In view of the Government's record, I do not believe that matters will end there. No doubt the schemes for steel workers and dockers—when sufficient of them can be persuaded to volunteer for redundancy and numbers in Liverpool and London, and so on, are reduced—will also be ended; it is most probable that the same will also apply to the miners when the Government feel strong enough to take such action, in view of their comments about privatising pits. Terminating the shipbuilding redundancy scheme will not help the industry; it will have a detrimental effect. I hope that even at this late stage the Government will have second thoughts and say, "We are prepared to continue with the present scheme until a new scheme is negotiated."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are still exploring the crucial question of what will happen after 1986. We have heard many references to the Minister's assurance, on which he is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
shortly to elaborate, that any subsequent scheme will be as good as the existing one. Surely there is a logical contradiction in that assertion. If the scheme will not be statutory, what basis has the Minister for saying that it will be as good as its predecessor? What can he do to effect that? Even if by some miracle the trade unions in the industry were able to negotiate as good a scheme, or, indeed, a better one—which is highly unlikely—I should have thought that, given the Minister's locus after 1986, the only way in which he could ensure that those words meant anything was through legislation. That would mean the continuance of a statutory scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's assurances so far are worth very little. If the new scheme is to be subject to negotiation, we must consider the likely background to such negotiation, if indeed there is anything left to negotiate by the end of 1986. Presumably negotiations will have to be seriously under way by early next year if all is to be in line for the following year. Unless we are to believe that by that time—the warship yards having been privatised—merchant shipbuilding within British Shipbuilders will have turned the corner and there are orders on the books, with no further fear of yard closures, the background for any negotiation over a new redundancy scheme will be one of financial restraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might take a different view if the Minister had suggested that the Government's cash limits in the appropriate financial years were so generous that British Shipbuilders would be able to negotiate a new non-statutory redundancy scheme. But there is no suggestion of that. The Government are always anxious to reduce their support for nationalised industries, including British Shipbuilders. When the trade unions try to negotiate a new scheme, presumably without Government support, they will hear the reality from the likes of Mr. Graham Day, whom my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) rightly described as one of the biggest disasters ever to chair a nationalised industry. He and his colleagues will say that if minimal investment in the yards is to continue, and if we are to compete by subsidising British shipbuilding to try to close the price gap between us and the far east, we cannot also have a generous redundancy scheme. Where would the money come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial crisis that British Shipbuilders faces is now the subject of continual discussion between management and trade unions. Into an already depressing and complicated situation is to be injected a further problem, the cost of redundancy schemes. That is another calculation that the board must put on to the balance sheet before the future of the industry can be negotiated. It is highly unlikely that British Shipbuilders will be able to negotiate anything comparable with the present scheme—in which there is plenty of room for improvement—unless money is set aside by the Government to make it possible. If the Government do that, they ought to tell us how it will work and how much money there will be. But if they do that, we might as well continue with the statutory scheme. We need not have wasted our time on Second Reading and in this Committee. We might as well have a Bill which says that the statutory scheme will continue after 1986.

This all comes down to the huge gap between the Government's rhetoric about the future of the industry and the present reality. The gap gets wider by the month and by the week. We talk about 200,000 grt. That is a meaningless assertion. The assertion that there is a magical figure at which the industry will settle down must be set against an examination of the work programme in merchant yards. The Minister should, as British Shipbuilders does with the shipbuilding negotiating committee from time to time, give us an up-to-date account of the state of the order books of each merchant yard left in British Shipbuilders. We do not want him to speculate on what will happen in future and tell us about the orders which we are about to get which for some reason we never do get, but to describe the current state of the order books and how far that will keep work going in each of the remaining yards. I believe that the orders currently on the order books of merchant yards would not take any of them past the end of 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will naturally say that he hopes that orders will come along. Perhaps one or two will. But a great many orders will have to be placed soon to give those yards any meaningful future beyond 1986. The Government have been so lax for so long in their support of merchant shipbuilding that we have reached a crisis which only the most immediate and effective action by them can overcome. For instance, Austin and Pickersgill, as the Minister will know, has been hoping to negotiate a further order with the Ethiopian state shipping line for nine months. That contract is still unsigned. Some further Government assistance would be very welcome. That point has been made very forcefully to the Minister on several occasions. If it has already taken nine months to negotiate that order and it is still by no means certain that that contract will be signed—all the indications are that if it is it will take a few weeks yet—the 23 months from now until the end of 1986 is not long to secure sufficient orders to change the whole picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to hear different noises from the Government about their basic policy towards British Shipbuilders: British shipbuilding needs support in the form of the policies which my hon. Friends described earlier on. Unless there are immediate indications from the Government that there will be a change of course and of attitude and that they will take steps to secure some of the orders that are available around the world and in this country, talk of 200,000 grt, talk of the industry having turned the corner and talk of an optimistic situation in which British Shipbuilders can negotiate a new scheme is unrealistic fantasy talk. For all that talk there will, in reality, be little left of the industry by the time that the new scheme is discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative which I have mentioned before and which may occur possibly before or after the end of 1986 is not that all the yards will disappear but that the merchant yards will go the same way as the warship yards and will be privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous sitting the Minister described that as a "horrific" assertion and implied that no such thought had crossed his mind. I find that strange, because there is considerable talk of some merchant yards being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
bought out. My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow referred to the approach made to him by the directors of Tyne Shiprepairers. It is also interesting that Mr. George Parker, the managing director of Austin and Pickersgill, was at that meeting. What was the managing director of a British Shipbuilders' merchant yard doing accompanying two other directors of a repair yard on Tyneside who wanted to buy the yard? When Mr. Parker behaves in such a way, it is bound to cross one's mind that perhaps even Mr. Parker has some intentions on Austin and Pickersgill outside the interests of British Shipbuilders, and that is what many people in the trade unions fear. So it is not unreasonable to make those assertions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past few hours we have heard nothing from the Government to illustrate their view of merchant shipbuilding two years from now. Until something is sketched in about the expected order situation and how the Government justify the notion that we shall achieve and hold 200,000 gross registered tonnes, and until we find what support will be available for the industry when the present scheme terminates and know what scheme British Shipbuilders can negotiate after the present scheme is finished, we must conclude that the purpose of the Bill is to eliminate a proper redundancy scheme and possibly to eliminate the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad and tiresome to have to spend so much time talking about redundancy, but this point is relevant and is as good an example as I can find to illustrate the need for Government support for the future of the industry so that fears about redundancy schemes and how good or bad they are are unfounded. The situation occurred at British Shipbuilders (Engineering and Technical Services) Limited in my constituency. That company has now effectively closed. I understand that BS has calculated that the closure has cost £5.4 million in extra special loss provision. Unfortunately, that sum has not been broken down item by item but is an aggregate of the return of regional development grant, writing off plant and machinery and redundancy payments and I imagine that a large part is redundancy payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What an absurd state of affairs when we can spend £5.4 million to close one of the best marine engineering facilities in Europe, which had had more than that sum in an investment only a year and a half before it closed! What an absurd state of affairs when the same amount of money, instead of being used to pay people off and put then on the dole, could have gone a long way to developing a new British marine diesel engine that could have been ahead of the rest of the world and the forerunner of the next generation of diesel engines and could have provided a tremendous future for skilled marine engineering work on Wearside and in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as the Tyne and the Clyde!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that the Government have no confidence in the industry's future; they will not tell us their intentions and; they make assertions that cannot be backed up. Tragically, the realism of Opposition Members is being confirmed and justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a slim hope, but perhaps the Minister's reply will give us and our constituents some hope for the future of the industry, after the end of the present scheme. Rather than being told about redundancy

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
schemes, although that would be some reassurance compared with the possibility of no redundancy scheme at all, we hope we shall be told about support and investment in the industry, and thus avoid the necessity for redundancy schemes in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the questions that have been asked, I shall start with a quotation from Hansard. On 9 January, my hon. Friend the Minister of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I propose to ask both organisations"—</p></blockquote>
that is, Harland and Wolff and British Shipbuilders—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consultation with their unions to establish appropriate successor schemes by the early autumn of 1986."</p></blockquote>
That is in good time before this extension starts to come to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is too early to predict the details of such schemes. They will be negotiated between the management and work force, just as in the private sector."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1985; Vol. 70, c. 793.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-west (Mr. Robinson), in what I shall charitably interpret as a piece of whimsy, sought to demonstrate that we could get equality between the private sector and the public sector by jacking up the redundancy payment rates—in other words, by transferring a shipbuilding redundancy payments scheme method of operation to the private sector. He will know, however, that that is not within the gift of this Government, and, even if it were, it would not be our intention to dictate to private sector employers the level at which they should compensate people who lose their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in the aftermath of this measure there is an equality of treatment between the two sectors, it will be that British Shipbuilders and private sector yards will both have redundancy arrangements negotiated between management and union, and that neither British Shipbuilders nor the private sector will operate statutory schemes. We cannot dictate to the private sector that it will mirror whatever is achieved by the British Shipbuilders management and work force as a successor scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked by the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) whether the successor scheme would be self-financing. I am not entirely sure what is meant by that; it can mean different things to different companies in different operations. However, I hope the hon. Gentleman will be reassured to know that provision for a successor scheme will be made in subsequent external financing limits. One cannot prejudge it; it will depend on a number of factors. But we shall want to cover British Shipbuilders on the cost of operating a successor scheme. So to the extent that it is neutral, one could argue in balance-sheet terms that it would be self-financing. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the future correctly underpinned the speeches of a number of hon. Members in this debate. I ask the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay), in particular, whether he would not consider the investment of £100 million deployed this year in British Shipbuilders as a mark of confidence in the industry. It is indeed a considerable demonstration of our confidence in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
Secondly, is it not also a mark of confidence that not only are we going into the core investment areas of capital, equipment, and so on, but we are now implementing the best and most sophisticated computer-aided design, systems—CADCAM—that are available to any shipbuilders in western Europe? That is a very futuristic form of investment and one that is already standing us in good stead, in conjunction with the new working practices that are being agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Under-Secretary aware, when he talks about an investment of £100 million in British Shipbuilders, that the Koreans have been investing almost £400 million a year in recent years, and that in 1982–83 the Japanese invested over £600 million in their seven biggest shipyards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It all depends on the base against which one invests. One problem is that the British shipbuilding industry has been around for a very long time. It has been around for decades longer than the Korean, Japanese and, indeed, most of the continental industries. Therefore, we have invested in plant and equipment over that long period and have been concerned to enhance, replace and update that investment. One could argue that the Koreans are still racing to come up to scratch to get the capability and capacity that existed for us many, many years ago. The Japanese have "critical mass" and they keep virtually all of their orders in house, that is, from Japanese shipping lines to Japanese shipyards. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the nub of the matter. If we are to make better use of our capacity we should continue to operate our schemes in the United Kingdom which even up the ante in the internationally competitive race. For example—this comes from another point raised by an Opposition Member—there is the home credits scheme where we offer soft loans over eight years at 8.5 per cent. for 80 per cent. of the capital cost of a particular order. That is a form of help of which I hope British shipping operators will make continuing and greater use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will also know that we are negotiating hard to continue intervention fund assistance and that we have been operating on positive EFLs in the industry for a long time. The hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mr. Adams) says that we have been spiteful and that the industry has been starved of investment, but how on earth can the amount of £1 billion plus, so often discussed, be described as spiting this industry? To paraphrase an expression of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, if this industry has been stabbed in the back by anything, it has been by a chequebook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What share of the £100 million has gone to Clydeside and where has it gone? I said that at one time we had 23 yards and that now we have three. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary will probably not understand the phrase, "Facts are chiels you canna ding". Interpreted into his language it means that one cannot deny facts. Those are the facts. The yards declined from 23 to three. Where did the money go? If it went somewhere, it did no good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants a yardby-yard breakdown of the investment programmes, I hope that he will concede that his is the sort of question that is best raised at the beginning of a debate and that I should need a little more notice than he gave. However, £100 million is available during this year to be distributed across the yards. As to the precise amount that has gone to Govan or to other facilities on the Clyde, I am afraid that I cannot give that information straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not a substantial chunk of the £100 million going to Yarrows which is up for sale? The Government hope that, unless they are overcome by the growing revolt among their Back Benchers, it will soon be building Trident. I do not believe that those of us who represent constituencies with military yards are particularly reassured by that sort of investment. Will the Minister also comment on the notion that one has to be cynical about the Government's intention, given what has happened elsewhere? The Minister and others talk continually about the £1,000 million that has been put into British Shipbuilders, but is it not the case, as its former chairman, Sir Robert Atkinson said, many hundreds of millions of pounds—nearly half—represented working capital put in at the time of nationalisation because the industry was effectively bankrupt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a final point which he may say is cynical, but it is borne out by experience. It is best expressed by a tale that I heard recently of a British Telecom engineer who went to a shipyard to instal an entirely new telephone system. As he was installing it he said to one of the shop stewards, "This is always a pre-privatisation job". Often investment that enhances the value of a yard also leads people to fear that it will be put up for sale. If the £100 million had gone into subsidising—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's intervention is turning into a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me ask one question. How much of that £100 million is better used this year to subsidise price gaps so that our merchant yards get orders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some substance in what the hon. Gentleman says. Let me give a rough breakdown of the £100 million. About 50 per cent. will go to Yarrow, leaving £50 million for investment elsewhere in British Shipbuilders. But that is investment. The money is not being used to cover losses, or for further non-productive equity participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to my point about computer-aided design—not because it is a huge programme, although it could run to £20 million, but because it shows that we are thinking very much about the future and about how we can compete with the design and lead-time advantages of the Scandinavians. We want to put our feet back in the frame and give British Shipbuilders an opportunity to get orders back from the Finns and the Swedes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
The hon. Member for Jarrow implied that there had been interference in the negotiations between unions and management at Tyne Shiprepair. I understand that Tyne Shiprepair employees were given a choice by Mr. Abbott and his colleages between leaving with full redundancy pay and transferring to the new owners with a negotiated buy-out, allowing for the reduction in their expectations from the shipbuilding redundancy payments scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said on Thursday that the unions had not been properly consulted. I understand from British Shipbuilders that when the buy-out was being negotiated, the unions at a national level instructed the local union representatives and shop stewards not to negotiate. The ban was lifted only at the end of the period allowed for negotiations, but an extension was agreed by British Shipbuilders to allow time for further negotiations at local level. The terms of the deal to compensate for the loss of SRPS were therefore negotiated with the unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local union members advised me that they were told by the directors that the deal was not negotiable. It was referred from national level to local level because union policy was to oppose any privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a post mortem on events which have already happened. If the hon. Gentleman feels that a principle is at stake and wants to pursue the matter further than the general response that I have given, he is free to write to me or to come and discuss it with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 extends the SRPS for a further 18 months, at the end of which voluntary arrangements will have to pertain. It is no more and no less important than that. It is not a form of skulduggery, but a continuation of the terms as they were under the old scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister reads his remarks, he will see that he has merely blown his own cover. We have received fake assurances from fake Ministers of a fake Government. We have had no assurance of a commitment by the Government to the future of the industry. There is nothing positive in anything that the Minister has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case there should be any misunderstanding, we should like to make it clear that if the Opposition were to vote against an extension of the scheme—although we propose not to push the clause stand part debate to a vote—it would be because we were all strongly opposed to the Government's decision to stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
