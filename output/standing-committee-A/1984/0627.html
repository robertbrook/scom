	<p>"(1) In respect of such activities as the Agency shall carry out on behalf of the Crown relating to pipelines and storage installations the Agency shall prepare within six months from the commencement date a five year plan for the development of investment in and expansion of the system.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take considerable pleasure in moving the new clause because it has enormous met it, which even hon. Members who have not displayed much interest in the Bill will recognise. I am confident that even the Minister will see its merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members are aware of the problems and deficiencies of the British public transport system. We have all been irritated by road blocks and delayed because of congestion on our busy roads. All hon. Members—save those who, on principle, will not travel on railways because they are publicly owned—have been delayed at some time on the railways. Conservative Members who have travelled on continental railways such as those in France, will have experienced the smooth, gliding speed of trains there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh! Why does not the hon. Gentleman put this into poetry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) is very sensitive this morning. I trust that we shall hear more from him, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and I put our powerful arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us compare the French trains with our railway system, in which there has not been enough investment, either in engines and carriages or in the permanent way. Ten or 15 years ago it was possible for me to write a letter by hand in a train between Doncaster and London; today I find it difficult even to do a crossword. That illustrates the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
There are also inadequacies in our investment in inland water transport. There is one new canal in Britain. The hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant)—I shall not, of course, seek to persuade him to intervene—with his interest in inland waterways, is well aware of the relevance of what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of inadequate investment in British transport, we may well be in the same position at a time of emergency as we were when the pipelines system was established. The overriding reason for establishing the pipelines was that the Government of the day and their experienced advisers realised that at times of strategic emergency it was essential to have a pipelines system so that the public transport system should not be under extreme pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public transport system is often blocked. There has not been enough investment. The principle of public squalor and private affluence has been applied to transport. In fact, private affluence leads to the congestion which makes an expansion of the pipelines system desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, who has demonstrated in Committee his considerable wisdom and his enormous knowledge of these matters, has made clear in the new clause our belief that if the British economy is to prosper it must have a mixed character. There is scope for both private and public enterprise. That belief is contained in subsection (2) of the new clause. If Conservative Members have any intelligence, they will be convinced by the merit of subsection (1), which deals with the development of the pipelines, and they will see that subsection (2) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"proposals to establish joint ventures with a company or companies, to establish financial and performance targets, and to move from a cost plus reimbursement basis to a profit sharing basis providing better incentives to the Agency".</p></blockquote>
The Government want to increase the revenue accruing to the Treasury to assist tax cutting. That is a vain exercise in the poor areas of Britain. If they seriously wish to reduce taxation, they must seek to expand the Government's income, and here is a useful way of doing that. It would lead to investment, an improvement in our transport strategy and infrastructure, and it would provide jobs. Indeed, as a representative of an area that employes many steel workers, I have to say that an expansion of pipelines would not only make sense in transport terms, but it would be extremely valuable in providing substantial orders for the steel industry, which remains at below capacity operation because of the appalling condition of the British economy and British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheer, clear, overriding merit of the new clause should more than counterbalance any discipline that the Government Whips might seek to impose in preventing the national interest being served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that there may be a steady and sustained development, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has proposed in subsection (3) that a period of five years should be laid down for the expansion, and subsection (4) provides that the agency should enter into a contractual arrangement with the Secretary of State. We do not want it hived off to private ventures which may or may not—probably may—be under the control of foreign companies. Those foreign companies may be more perceptive of value and merit than certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
private sector operations in the United Kingdom, which, like the Government, are entirely obsessed with rooking the public interest to promote the private affluence to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion for a mixed economy and joint ventures emphasises the different approach that needs to be adopted in the management of our flagging and failing economy. Few Conservative Members would deny the need for the creation of jobs. I hope that all Conservative Members agree that if the new clause were accepted—I hope that the Minister will not have the audacity to confound our expectations—the investment that would accrue from the five-year development that we commend would be on the basis of British ordering. Some companies in the private sector show patriotism and try to purchase their material, plant and equipment from British sources—certainly, most public organisations do. Until Mr. MacGregor became chairman—he may not have the same attachments—the National Coal Board devoted 95 per cent of its investments to British equipment, machinery and raw materials. That is a useful basis and market for private enterprise. New clause 2 provides a real opportunity for private enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last paragraph of the BNOC annual report for 1983 contains an interesting and relevant reference, It clearly demonstrates that at the time of the report, the Secretary of State had adopted an entirely approving approach to the matter. It seems that no Conservative Members, except perhaps the Minister, have had the foresight to bring that valuable document into Committee. As they have shown remarkably little interest in the Bill, they may not even have read it in preparation for their service in Committee. I feel, therefore, that it would be appropriate for me to read the relevant paragraph of the report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Commercial use has increased during the year by 3 per cent over 1982".—</p></blockquote>
few industrial activities in Britain showed a 3 per cent increase in 1982 or 1983—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and total pipeline movements are now well in excess of 3 million tonnes per annum; the use of storage has also increased with plans for a further increase in 1984. During the year, a contract was concluded which will lead to the connection of Mobil's Coryton refinery to the Government's pipeline system, which will then transport products to a new commercial terminal to be built at Wymondham in Norfolk. This will result in a significant additional use of the system from 1985. The Corporation has entered into an agreement with the United States Air Force to act as its agent in connection with the hire of commercial storage facilities and associated services in the UK."</p></blockquote>
We are not complaining about that. If we examine the American system—for example, the NASA position—we see ample evidence of partnership between public and private sector interests, which is precisely what we are seeking to achieve. As the Government are frequently disposed to commend American achievements and approaches in both political and economic activity, I should have thought that they would be interested in at least a degree of emulation of such practices. Such emulation could easily be achieved by accepting the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will tell us about events since the link with the Mobil refinery at Coryton. I should have thought that the growth and buoyancy that we have seen in this activity would have been maintained
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
or even accelerated, so that work could already be under way to extend the link. In view of the condition of the M1 motorway when I last used it—on that occasion I travelled only 20 miles in one and three quarter hours—there are ample grounds for an extension of the pipelines system. Given the Government's lust to take out the oil from our offshore fields at the fastest possible speed—we now take out far more than we use—surely much of that oil could be transported by a pipelines system cheaply, smoothly and without causing offence and congestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may not be prepared to accept the new clause; they may argue that they are taking out the oil so quickly that there is no point in having a pipelines system of any quality and that, for the short life of our oilfields, we may as well rely on congesting and disrupting the public transport system. By accepting the new clause they would confirm that they were not operating only on short-term considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a choice to make. By accepting the new clause, they can demonstrate wisdom and a degree of political balance, which is certainly needed and with which they have not so far proved familiar. The new clause would provide substantial orders and considerable industrial advantage. It would make a helpful contribution to our public transport problems and would be helpful environmentally. If the reporting and public relations aspects are properly handled, it will, to some extent, demonstrate to Britain and the world that the Government are less dogmatic and less obsessed by greed than many Opposition Members have come to suspect over recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, I hope, demonstrated the merit of the new clause and shown that it is a provision which Parliament should approve at this time of economic difficulty. Before an interesting, yet difficult, by-election, it would be valuable to the Government to demonstrate to the people of that constituency—and those of the other 649 constituencies—that they are interested in the nation's welfare rather than the rewards accruing to the few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look at the new clause in a spirit of balance, moderation and sense, that he will view it helpfully and that we shall have the support of Conservative Members who have the sort of vision that the hon. Member for Reading, West has always displayed towards inland waterways. They must recognise that people are frustrated by the inadequacies of our road system and realise that the grossly inadequate investment in our railway system over the past five years means that other steps must be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that even the greediest of Conservative Members—who are so obsessed by privatisation—will recognise that there are areas of our economy that have to be left in the public sector or as a happy combination of public and private industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen to the Minister's reply with great interest. He has got away with dismissing—always courteously—virtually all our proposed amendments to the Bill. Some may not have been as worthy as new clause 2—although some may have been worthier—which is most meritorious, as I am sure many hon. Members would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not regard the Minister as too unkind if he says that the new clause presents difficulties to the Government because to accept it would make them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
appear to be effecting a U-turn in industrial and economic policy. In that case, the Minister should consult the Secretary of State and other Ministers again and seek to persuade them not to take a dismissive view of the new clause. We shall be understanding if the Minister says that he has considerable regard for our new clause, and that he proposes to do his best to persuade his colleagues to allow him to accept the clause or a similar provision on Report. We might decide not to press the matter to a vote—providing, of course, that the right hon. Gentleman's assurance is relatively firm. We need that assurance and I believe that it would be widely welcomed throughout the country which desperately needs the values and merit offered in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was worried when my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) mentioned the by-election in Brecon and Radnor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 provides for approval by the Secretary of State for Defence among others and I have a horrible feeling that the right hon. Gentleman will rush out between now and next Thursday and build a new pipeline from Gloucester or Bristol into Brecon and Radnor. The Government are looking desperately for ways of shoring up their vote. We may have given them a new idea in the new clause and between now and Thursday Brecon and Radnor could be covered in pipelines—following the tradition of saving barracks and territorial training units in Senny Bridge. I hope that the Minister will consider bringing to the Secretary of State's attention the fact that we would welcome the creation of jobs from any quarter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clause was prompted initially by Mr. Adams' excellent review of the development of the pipeline. In his lecture, he discussed the five-year plan for the refurbishment of the system which BNOC implemented in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and which was then coming to an end. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the plan has been completed, what it has achieved and what will happen next. Some information can be gleaned from the annual reports, but I should be grateful if the Minister could give us the details. Where do we go from here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Appropriations and Estimates figures and charts suggest that BNOC has been spending between £3 million and £4 million a year on capital development in the past three or four years. Can the Minister confirm that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision has now been made not to privatise the system; all the management study groups and interdepartmental working committees have reported. It is surely timely to consider establishing a new five-year development plan not merely to refurbish and modernise the existing system, as the previous plan has done, but to look for areas of expansion. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us whether any plans are in the pipeline—excuse the pun—for further developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the pipeline system has been closely allied to the supply of fuel for jets in civil aviation airfields. Is that being discussed in relation to Gatwick or Heathrow? My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth, who mentioned the matter earlier, will note that there is already a spur from Saffron Walden to Stansted. Most of us object strongly to another huge development in the south-east corner of England, but if we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
the misfortune to see it proceed, there will be considerable opportunities for the expansion of commercial opportunities through the pipeline. Such developments would fit in very well with the five-year plan that we are suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) of the new clause suggests
	<br><blockquote><p>"a five year plan for the development of investment in and expansion of the system".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister will tell us the plans of those who have been managing the pipeline over the past year or two for its future expansion, development or modernisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for subsection (2), 1 should have thought that its good free-market language would commend it to every member of the Committee. "Joint ventures", "financial and performance targets", "profit sharing", "better incentives" are all terms which ought to appeal to Conservative Members. I think that it was the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) who called me a closet Thatcherite; he may find that much of the language in subsection (2) bears out his view. Our chief purpose is to make public enterprise work successfully, vibrantly and profitably. Subsection (2) proposes looking at other ways of organising the financing of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained what I thought to be the financing of the system in our sixth sitting in columns 187–196. The basis of charging is cost plus on most of the pipeline routes, with a straightforward rental basis for storage. In considering the five-year plan, the agency should have another look at the cost plus reimbursement basis, and move onto a profit sharing basis, much more closely tied to throughput. There would then be more incentive to look for more business, and a better spinoff for the agency, the Department of Energy and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the corporation and the Department ever considered proposals for joint ventures with commercial developers, operators and oil companies to develop and expand any part of the system in the past year or two? If so, did they ever get off the ground? Were they prohibited as a result of the reviews that have taken place? Perhaps the Minister will tell us of any moves towards joint ventures and joint developments with the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such ventures are a good idea. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth said, they should be part of the mixed economy. We could maximise the value of both public and commercial development, hand-in-hand in the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing better incentives to the Agency".</p></blockquote>
I drew some comfort from the Minister's remarks in column 190, although I have not drawn much comfort from his other comments. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"BNOC receives a form of incentive payment, in that 1 per cent of commercial revenues go to BNOC, so an incentive element is already built into its present agreement. That encourages BNOC to maximise the commercial private sector revenues. Of course, the corporation does not at present pass on any part of those incentives to the staff…. Following our debate, I made a note to ask the agency to consider devising an incentive arrangement…. That is a useful suggestion, although it may be easier in principle than in practice. However, I undertake to ask the agency to consider the possibility".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 June 1985; c. 190.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
I thought that that was at least a moderately encouraging response to our point. I think that the hon. Member for Southgate made the same point in that debate. An arrangement to provide incentives for staff and the agency as a whole is included in subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides for the plan to be approved, not only by the Secretary of State for Energy, but by the Secretary of State for Defence. During our debates we have found out what has been happening behind the scenes in the Department of Energy. The Secretary of State for Defence should have a say in this matter. Perhaps if he could tear himself away from Brecon and Radnor, he could attend the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot leave the system in the hands of the Secretary of State for Energy. He has already proved that he would have jeopardised the national security arrangements of the pipelines. Subsection (3) suggests that the plan must be approved by the Secretary of State for Energy and by the Secretary of State for Defence.—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least we might then make sure that there would be no further attempts to privatise our strategic assets, as the Department of Energy has tried to do over the past 18 months. Although I do not feel that pipelines and storage installations would be safe in the hands of the Secretary of State for Defence, at least we should ensure that the Ministry of Defence and the United States Air Force have a say in what happens to the pipelines, as any change will have a profound effect on their operations, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I originally tabled the new clause with only three subsections; I added subsection (4) as an afterthought. My decision to do that arose from discussions at our sixth sitting when the Minister confirmed my impression that there was no established, long-term contractual arrangement for BNOC to manage the pipelines system. I understand that the permanent arrangement has expired and has been renewed on a basis which I do not fully understand. The Minister described it in columns 187–188. He suggests that the staff who will be transferred to the agency—many reluctantly and unwillingly —would have more security and stability if the agency and the Department reached an agreement as expeditiously as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) seeks to ensure that the contractual arrangements between the agency and the Department of Energy should be at least for the lifetime of the five-year plan. That would give a clear signal to the staff, some of whom are reluctant to be transferred from an oil corporation to a pipelines agency. A five-year agreement would give them a sense of stability and security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister acknowledged at our sixth sitting what a good job the staff in BNOC's pipelines division had done in the past few years. They have done a remarkable job; they have picked up a system that was losing money, was down beat and had been neglected before 1977. They have turned it around from a loss to a profit. The pipelines division has made between £3 million and £4 million a year profit in the last couple of years. That is a tribute to the staff of the pipelines division of BNOC, although they are getting a kick in the teeth for achieving that remarkable turnaround.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that there is a strong case for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
establishing a five-year plan on the basis that we suggest and for looking at new, money-raising ways in which to operate the system commercially, such as through joint ventures with the private sector, the potential expansion of the system if Stansted goes ahead, and other opportunities for development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pipelines system does not extend into the Principality or go north of the border and there may be a case for expanding it in both directions. There have been years of refurbishing, improving the utilisation of the line and modernising its equipment and information systems. Now that the Government have decided not to privatise the system this is an opportune time to give the agency a new lease of life and a new development plan along the lines that the new clause suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the debate. I am rather disappointed that the experience of the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) with British Rail has prompted him to table a new clause of this type. I am not sure how he hopes to travel by pipeline in future, but if one takes his remarks literally that appears to be one of his ambitions. I assure the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that having pipelines in a constituency is not necessarily a vote winner. I shall not be advising my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence along the lines that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency I have as many, if not more, pipelines than any other hon. Member. All the North sea oil and gas that lands north of Aberdeen has to pass through my constituency and I have about seven or eight pipelines. Particularly when they are being built, pipelines create a lot of work for the local Member of Parliament. I do not resent it. It is nice to be wanted by one's constituents and to look after their interests but many of them do not welcome the pipelines too much. It is perhaps the negative effect that it might have on votes that the hon. Member for Wentworth is hoping to use to boost the flagging hopes of the Labour candidate in Brecon and Radnor; if we did something about pipelines there, it might help his fortunes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already had a good debate on this subject. I am glad that the hon. Members have picked up some of the points that I made earlier and have, I assume, endorsed them by putting them into the new clause. Both hon. Members asked me one or two points of information. I was asked what has been spent on capital expenditure in recent years and I am delighted to respond. In 1980-81, the figure was £2.47 million, in 1981–82 it was £1.75 million, in 1982–83 it was £2.6 million, in 1983-84 it was £3.65 million and in 1984–85 it was £4.32 million. The provisional estimates for 1985–86 are £2.62 million. There is a continuing process of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The five-year plan is related to that. I do not want to cause any confusion, but, as the Department's agent, BNOC has regularly drawn up overall plans for discussion with my Department and with the Ministry of Defence. That planning is far more of a continuing consultation process than a blueprint for a specific period. Moreover, those plans cover the engineering aspects and so on of the pipelines, rather than merely the commercial exploitation, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I should like to correct one small point
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
that the member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney made—about charging. The basis of cost charging is related to the Ministry of Defence. The rates for the commercial users of the pipelines are negotiated with them and are market-based tariffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the attractions of the new clause, but I also see some difficulties. The main difficulty is fairly straightforward. The primary purpose of the pipelines was strategic. It is for the Ministry of Defence and not for the agency to decide how the parts of the system used for defence are developed and expanded. It would be for the agency to advise on how the system could be developed to expand the commercial traffic. Although anything as formal as a five-year plan is not necessarily the most appropriate approach, I assure both hon. Gentlemen that I shall look to the agency for proposals on the pipelines' longer-term development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the strategic reasons that I mentioned, it would be inappropriate for a plan describing changes to be publicly available. Given the integrated nature of the pipeline, it would not be practical to attempt to separate strategic and civil improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth asked about joint ventures with companies operating the pipelines. I support the sentiment behind the new clause, which is the expansion of the commercial utilisation of the pipelines. The hon. Member for Wentworth referred to the Wymondham project in co-operation with Mobil, which is a good example. However, it is not appropriate for the agency to be involved in joint ventures on its own account. The agency does not own any part of the system, nor does it invest its own money in it. It simply acts as the Secretary of State's agent in a management capacity. I assure the hon. Gentlemens that we intend to encourage the agency to develop the use of the system, as at Wymondham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred to the contract and agreement between my Department and the agency. As he acknowledged, I have already said that a new agreement between the Department and the agency would be desirable. I repeat that it will be to the agency's advantage to include in the agreement as much security and stability as can be reasonably expected, which will help future planning. The terms and conditions of such an agreement would be for negotiation with the agency, but I reaffirm that I shall keep the suggestion in mind when the agency comes into being and the new agreement is negotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that the agency should devise an incentive scheme to reward its staff for improving efficiency and for increasing commercial revenues, and I shall ask it to do so. On a cautionary note, I shall say that it is easy to express that objective, but there may be practical problems in achieving it. However, I shall discuss the possibility with the agency and ask it to examine the proposal carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had another useful debate. I have already made a number of commitments about the future of the system. I hold to them because I believe in them as strongly as do the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Wentworth. However, the hon. Member for Wentworth attributed to me the audacity to confound and I am glad to live up to it. It is not appropriate to embody the agency's objectives in legislation. It is better and more flexible to have an agreement between the Department and the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
I shall do my best by other means to achieve the objectives sought in the new clause and the debate has given me the opportunity to reaffirm my intention. I hope that the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Wentworth will not proceed with their new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply disappointed, We heard a residual attachment to wisdom from the Minister. He had to murmur about assurances and arrangements which would, to some extent, serve a similar purpose to the new clause. However, his assurances are so minuscule that that do not even approach the scale of need presented in the new clause. Our disappointment is intense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our disappointment is compounded by the fact that although the new clause gave Conservative Members the opportunity to serve their constituents by joining us in diagnosing some of the transport ills of the United Kingdom and supporting our attempt to relieve the congestion and difficulties that are experienced by all hon. Members and their constituents, they have not taken that opportunity. It is a pity that Standing Committees do not receive the attention that they should, because it is scandalous that an opportunity to improve the appalling neglect of public transport in recent years does not bring even one Conservative Member to his feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If hon. Members had responded to a debate on public transport, they might not have been in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They could have said how much they supported an extension of the pipelines system so that they could pass to and fro on British roads in their foreign cars. However, I shall not pursue that line, because I do not want to delay the Committee. I have never sought to do that, Mr. Forrester, although your predecessor suspected it sometimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did me a disservice. I very much resented it when he suggested that I was critical of the publicly-owned British Rail. I am certainly not. I am well aware of the devoted service of British Rail and the major contribution that it has made. I was concerned about the grossly inadequate investment by the Government. British Rail is not responsible for that. I compared British Rail with the French railways, which have received substantial support from the French Government, and France benefits from that. Britain would benefit from an improved transport system, and the new clause would greatly assist in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most astonishing aspect of the Minister's speech was an absence of any respect for the work ethic. He seemed to regret pipelines, in case constituents should complain. I accept that the Minister likes to help constituents, as we all do, but I like to help my constituents and those of at least 400 or 500 hon. Members, who want to be employed in industry. The industrial orders that would flow from the expansion that we seek would be substantial, certainly in steel and engineering. The expansion would provide jobs in the Labour party's heartland, and there would be spin-off activity—perhaps unfortunately—in some of the marginal seats, which Conservative Members should con-

sider with more care than they appear to be showing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was kind and considerate in providing us with detailed information about how much has been spent on the maintenance and management of the system. Such surprising prudence by the Government in incurring such expenditure—or in allowing it to be incurred—is entirely right. However, I am not satisfied, because the expenditure to which the Minister referred was largely for maintenance. We want the Government to display the same wit as has been displayed by Mobil and BNOC. They both perceived the need that we perceived, but the Minister's reply contained no evidence that the Government have understood the serious need that exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will forgive me if I make another suggestion. The Government are so set on privatising—as is demonstrated by their reluctance to accept our new clause—that they have not perceived the difficulties that would face them in a few years' time, were Britain unfortunate enough at the next general election to return them to office. By 1988 or 1989, everything will have been privatised and there will be no sops for the Government to offer their Back Benchers. Lust and greed are never satisfied; Conservative Members always want more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is an opportunity for the Minister to display the foresight that the Government have never manifested. If they accepted our new clause and the five-year plan described in detail by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), they could in five years time have a few crumbs to satisfy the greed of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause offers the Government a gift horse and they are looking it in the mouth. Even the most rabidly Conservative Government should not be so stupid as to refrain from accepting gift horses like this. With deep regret, I face the disappointment. I am amazed that the Government have not seen the advantages of the new clause, and I trust that when the Secretary of State for Defence returns from building barracks in Brecon and Radnor his right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Energy will have second thoughts, and will visit him and that they will have a word with the USAF and see whether it would agree to developments in the pipelines system similar to those in the Mobil-Coryton-BNOC venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that between now and Report, the Minister will perceive the merits of the new clause, which seeks to serve the national interest. If unfortunately at the same time it provides a further prospect of satisfaction of greed, we can contest that in five years. It is sad; I hope that the Minister, having recognised the merits of the new clause which I know, from the minuscule gestures he has made, he does, will on Report expand his minuscule gestures to something to serve the national interest more substantially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two new clauses are substantial in relevance and in importance. It may be somewhat indigestible for us to take them together, but I can see the point of our doing so, Mr. Forrester, as they both deal with the issue of price. I think that oil prices will be the dominant issue of the next few weeks—even more dominant than they have been in the past 12 months or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 3 was prompted by the arguments used by the Minister for abolishing BNOC in the first place. In his statement of 13 March he said that his reason for abolishing BNOC was that market trends had turned away from term contracting to the spot market, and that, as a result, there was no purpose in retaining BNOC. The Minister was sufficiently cautious to say that at present that was what the trend appeared to be. He was not sure that the trend was permanent, but he was prepared to abolish BNOC on the basis of what was only a possible temporary market trend. I do not know how temporary the trend was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the reason that the Minister gave for abolishing the corporation was a trend in the market, surely the agency should have the responsibility of helping to inform and advise the Secretary of State on market trends. If the trend is reversed and there is a movement away from spot markets, it would be the first sign that the Minister should activate the participation agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for new clause 3 arose from the argument adduced by the Minister for abolishing BNOC. However, new clauses 3 and 4 have other purposes—above all, to probe more deeply into the Minister's thinking about what will be happening to prices and market trends in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reminding ourselves of the Minister's remarks about the role and purpose of BNO C. Only a week before he announced its abolitiion, he said in evidence to the Select Committee on Energy:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has, and this has been spelt out at different times, responsibility for example towards security of supplies".</p></blockquote>
That is the first role. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it has responsibility for maximising the benefit to the United Kingdom economy.—"</p></blockquote>
that is basically stabilising prices, and constitutes the second role—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and given those different roles that it has—another one is that it does provide evidence of arm's length prices so far as taxation is concerned, and this was made clear in the Treasury evidence to the Committee."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>375</span>
That is the third role that the Minister attributed to BNOC .He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the role of BNOC is particularly different"—</p></blockquote>
from the role of a private sector company—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is when it takes account of the wider public interest, and that is why, before proposals are made on BNOC prices, there is this recognised procedure of consultation between BNOC and the Government, because it is the Government that provides this wider national interest before final decisions are taken."</p></blockquote>
The Minister went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It think if BNOC had not acted in a way which in both July and in January avoided destabilising the market, the financial consequences for this country of a free fall in price at that time—and you cannot quantify it because it depends on a whole lot of other hypothetical assumptions—would have exceeded the actual cost of public money in supporting BNOC."</p></blockquote>
Although the Minister changed his mind a week later, on 6 March he saw a fundamental role for BNOC, not only in stabilising the price but in three or four other respects. He felt that there was a need to assist wherever possible because of the involvement of wider financial national interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of whether the market has changed, the Minister's fears about the consequences of what he called "a free fall in price" are still present. The Minister was so anxious in July last year and January this year about the fiscal, economic and financial consequences of such a free fall that he encouraged BNOC to behave uncommercially and stepped in to try to stabilise oil prices and prevent it from occurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Minister intends to abolish BNOC will not abolish the problem or its consequences. If those consequences were valid in March, they are still valid in June and July. We believe that the Government should have an agency to fulfil the wider role of monitoring and advising on petroleum and market trends, in addition to providing that information for the Department. If the consequences of the free fall are even half as serious as the Minister suggested in March, we should be given some idea of what is happening in the oil market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's original reason for abolishing BNOC was the change in the trend from term contracting to spot markets. No one has denied that that change has occurred. It was happening last year before the Minister made his confession in March and changed his mind about BNOC's role, and the trend was firmly fixed throughout 1984. It was brought out last December, in a written answer to the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). The hon. Gentleman asked how many times in the previous five years the market had been dominated by spot markets rather than by term contracts. Throughout 1984, there was much evidence that the trend had moved away from term contracts to spot markets. It seemed to be a major revelation to the Minister in March, but it had been happening for some time, as everybody else realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be important for an organisation other than the Department of Energy to monitor fundamental changes in the structure of the international oil market that affect market trends, and one of the most important changes is the growth of non-OPEC oil supplies. In 1984, non-OPEC sources provided 24 million barrels a day,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
compared with OPEC's present supply of 16 million or 17 million barrels a day. There has been a dramatic shift. What impact will that have on future petroleum and crude oil trends?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major alteration is the growth of a futures market. Inside two years, a major futures commodity market has been established in the United States—the New York metropolitan exchange—which celebrates its second anniversary this year. I was fascinated to see how many million barrels of crude oil are traded forward as part of the futures market. It is a new development in the way oil is traded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NYMEX is only two years old. In its first year, 320 million barrels of crude oil were involved in its transactions and contracts. In 1984, 360 million barrels of crude oil were involved in its transactions and contracts. In 1984, 360 million barrels of oil were involved in futures markets. That is a major new facet of the international oil market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency that will have to sell 260,000 million barrels of royalty oil on behalf of the Government will have to know a great deal about some of those trends—particularly the futures market—which will help to determine oil prices. At a previous sitting, I asked for an assurance that nothing in the Bill would stop the agency taking a position in the futures market if it felt that that would support and enhance its role as the manager of royalty oil. The Department of Energy should have supplementary knowledge of those trends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency must be allowed to play a significant monitoring role on petroleum prices and market trends so that it can respond flexibly to that market, and possibly even to the futures market. Can the Minister assure us that the agency will be able to consider those matters, and thus be an alternative source of advice and information on market trends? That will be vital during the coming months and next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what hon. Members are picking up from the tom-toms in the oil industry, but I am picking up a growing belief that oil prices will fall substantially in the coming weeks. There may be a conspiracy, of course, but the same message is coming from many sources. There will be a significant fall in oil prices in the coming months, and that will have traumatic effects on the Government's economic, financial and fiscal policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OPEC has got itself into a hopeless position, and however much it tries to shore up its arrangements in the short term, it cannot prevent if not a free fall a substantial fall in crude oil prices in the coming months. That will have a dramtic effect on Government revenue and could have an impact on trading in royalty oil, which will be the agency's main management function. The agency must be involved closely in monitoring the market trends and deciding, in conjunction with the Department of Energy, how to trade the royalty oil on behalf of the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are hooked on oil revenues: they need every penny. The Wood Mackenzie report points to a significant shortfall in the estimated revenue from North sea oil in the next 12 months if prices fall. A fall in the price of oil without a corresponding devaluation in sterling means that the Government could be quids out in all their estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sobering to realise that the past five years have been the best years of our oil life. They have now gone.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
The Minister talks of the second boom and all the drilling and appraising that is now going on, but that will be only just about enough to help us in the 1990s to stay self-sufficient in oil. It cannot do much more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10th anniversary of the first barrel of oil being brought ashore was celebrated a couple of weeks ago with cakes and coffee, but this is the last year when we shall drill more oil than in any previous year. This year is the peak and from now on the oil party is nearly over. The Government's largesse from being the accidental beneficiary of the greatest fiscal windfall in modern British history will decline. That will cause lots of stresses and strains in the policy of the Department of Energy and in the Government's fiscal and financial policy. It could also cause the agency tremendous strains in dealing and managing royalty oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of what could happen. If the price of oil falls as dramatically as is now forecast—in the free-fall fashion that the Minister was worried about—there may come a time when we should consider seriously banking royalty oil and not taking it out. It might make good, economic and commercial sense to come to an agreement with the oil companies to bank the oil until a better price could be obtained for it. That has been discussed before in the context of a depletion policy: the Select Committee on Energy received evidence on that. It might be a good idea in the next 12 months to come to an arrangement with Shell, Esso and BP in the mature Ninian and Forties fields where no jobs would be lost and no development hampered as the tax return has already been obtained from them. It might make good economic sense to bank it barrel for barrel with the oil companies until some future date when it might be more advantageous to raise it. That could be done in two or three mature fields without any effect on the development programme or on jobs. It would, however, have an effect on revenues and a profound effect on the agency, whose function of managing and trading royalty oil on behalf of the Crown would be completely changed if royalty oil were banked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oil prices may fall dramatically in the next 12 months. It makes sense for the agency to be knowledgeable about the trends, to monitor them and to advise the Secretary of State accordingly. Such trends could have a drastic impact not only on the agency's activities but on the Government's economic, fiscal and energy policies. The agency will be at the centre of the problems as much as BNOC would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of my remarks so far have been in support of new clause 3. New clause 4 takes the other role that the Minister has described. The Minister and I colluded in December last year in presenting the case for BNOC, and I remember his dramatic speech. One of his main points concerned the role of BNOC as an arm's length price arranger for taxation purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has not gone away. The fact that there is now more spot trading than contract trading may help to make the price somewhat more transparent, but it leaves the oil taxation office very vulnerable and dependent on published prices and the major oil companies. I found an example of the complex trading in North sea oil in 	<i>Petroleum Intelligence Weekly</i> a useful reference source of which I am an avid reader. It des-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
cribes how one cargo of North sea crude which started trading in December 1983 or January 1984 went through 24 trading entities in 36 deals over a few months. The "daisy chain" took it from BNOC to Shell, Sohio, Tricentrol, Acorn, Chevron and others before it ended up in Sun's Marcus Hook refinery in the United States. Similar daisy chains are found all over the North sea, adding to the complexity of the markets and the difficulty of assessing who is buying and selling what for how much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is trading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it is. But it is the Government's job to tax, and to know what is going on so that there are no loopholes for cheating of any kind. We think that the combination of BNOC and the Oil Taxation Office provided the Government and the country with an effective way of taxing North sea companies, and the Minister made a powerful case for BNOC's role in that regard last December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market has changed: it has become a spot market rather than a term market for the time being. But the Oil Taxation Office will still be presented with a substantial headache when it has to work out how to tax North sea companies. The Minister said himself in an earlier sitting that the agency's role in determining prices for royalty oil might provide a useful peg for the Oil Taxation Office to use in determining the fiscal regime of the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have demonstrated that the market will be in an even greater state of flux in the next 12 months than it has been in the last 12 months. We shall be giving birth to the new agency at that time. As a result there will be major issues of pricing and fiscal policy. There is a strong case for the agency and the Department of Energy to work closely together in the whole area of pricing and taxation. New clauses 3 and 4 seek to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are two important new clauses. I hope that I can persuade the Minister not to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975 contains a rather interesting section. Section 3(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Corporation to tender advice to the Secretary of State with respect to any matter connected with petroleum as to which the Corporation considers it appropriate to provide advice for the Secretary of State or he requires the Corporation to give him advice."</p></blockquote>
Parliament reflected on the matter again in the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, schedule 3(28) of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In section 3 of that Act (general duties of the Oil Corporation) subsection (3) (duty to tender advice to the Secretary of State) shall be omitted."</p></blockquote>
Parliament in its wisdom—this was debated at the time—decided that tendering advice to the Secretary of State was not requisite. A number of factors intervened over the years since the formation of the corporation in 1975 until 1982 when it was considered not appropriate for the body to do what the Opposition are now recommending it should do. This is old ground. We have trodden it before and we should not do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed the attitude of the Opposition on clause 5.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
They accepted it with alacrity. Clause 5 made BNOC a vassal of the state. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Agency to comply with any general or specific direction given by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That goes back to section 4 of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. If the influence of the state can be such as to guide the corporation against its true interests, I do not feel that the true market is operating. One only has to return to the BNOC report and to examine the words of Mr. Goskirk, which I shall abridge. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation considered that its own commercial interests could best be protected by a reduction in term prices … Her Majesty's Government … decided to continue the then-existing contract prices… Substantial losses resulted."</p></blockquote>
The intervention of the Government in the market, giving advice and being able to control through section 4 then—and through clause 5 in future—made the agency simply a creature of Government. That is not appropriate to the operation of market forces. That is my second argument against the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third argument is this. BNOC was never effective in crisis management. Admittedly, it could not do much in 1973 because it had not been formed. However, I watched attentively its actions in 1979 and 1980. It could not stabilise the world oil situation. That was not conceivable. It did not even do a good job. It was a piece of timber floating on the water, being thrust right, left and centre. It could not control the market, and the market went awry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is arguing a case that has not been made. New clause 3 does not suggest intervention in the market or price. It requires the agency

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a case by throwing balls in the air and watching them come down. He has learnt from the Bill's structure that the format and responsibility of BNOC has come down from a giant structure in 1975, when it had overseas commitments and commitments in the North sea, to one with very diminished responsibilities. All its responsibilities are to dispose of royalty oil, of which it had about 260,000 barrels a day in 1984, and the management of strategic pipelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency is in charge of one or two marginal matters which will have no bearing on this such as the custody of participation agreements. It has lost the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
right to market petroleum, unless that is subscribed to by the Secretary of State. It is not a marketing agency for the smaller companies, and its pricing powers will have been deleted. Unless the Secretary of State brings general trading back, it will be out of the picture altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A stultified agency is being contrived. Some Conservative Members have suggested that the agency should be abolished or privatised, but that is not the general view of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its new agency format, BNOC does not have the experience in a complicated market to do that precise job. It will not derive advantage from advice from the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep interrupting. Apart from Shell, BP and Esso, can the hon. Gentleman name any other United Kingdom North sea oil company that will trade 260,000 barrels a day? That is what the agency will be doing, so it will have a view about price. Whether or not the hon. Gentleman likes it, it will be one of the biggest traders in the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: BP and the Shell group have trading rights throughout the world and an enormous barrelage of oil. They are not just trading in North sea oil. They are dealing with prices and purchases in the United States, the Middle East and many other parts of the world. They have vast experience and planning departments which can study these matters daily. They are the people who study carefully and find out what prices are. They will study the spot market. The oil market is very complicated. Our responsibility should be to keep the Government out of it and to utilise the available market experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Formerly the market was dictated to by the seven majors, and now through OPEC. OPEC is not very successful in managing it. There have been too many leaks and too many countries have been prepared to cut their prices and offer discounts. In a period of oversupply, the term market has disappeared, or is gradually disappearing. I predict that term markets will return with tight supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Redmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Don Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I wish to complete my case. I appreciate that the Committee will end at 1 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said, it has been difficult for OPEC to rig the market, largely because of the non-OPEC producers and the amount of oil from the Soviet Union. OPEC now produces fewer than 60 million barrels a day, whereas in the first quarter of 1985 the non-OPEC countries produced 27.6 million barrels a day—a considerable amount. It is the non-OPEC producers that can beat the rationers at their own game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another growing tendency has further complicated the market. The Minister would have to take into account the amount of counter trading in oil with Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Iran and Iraq. Those factors make the oil market complicated. They are best dealt with by experienced people who have been engaged in oil markets for years, not by a small enterprise used to dealing with a small quantity of oil which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
may be taking money in cash. It is not for such a body to give advice to the Secretary of State. He can receive it direct from the oil companies, with which he has made arrangements for the market to receive support in tight corners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From time to time I have bemoaned the fact that Conservative Members have not given the Committee the benefit of their advice and experience. On this occasion I am sorry that the Committee had the benefit of the advice of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not agree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just that. The hon. Gentleman seems to have no sympathy with the case for flexibility in public life. He has all the capacities and qualities of the pterodactyl. He is like the ostrich that does not merely stick its head in the sand at times of crisis but spends its times of contentment and ease collecting sand to stick its head in unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North displays absolute obstinacy and an unwillingness to accept that there is ever a case for change. When the hon. Gentleman entered the realms of metaphore, I saw his hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Durant) put his head in his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North referred to schedule 3 and section 3 of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982. His interpretation of that Act was more accurate than his appreciation of the need to reassess the oil market. I always hesitate to talk about interpretations of statutes because I am not a lawyer, but the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North was correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately it is not 1982 but 1985. In the three years since the hon. Gentleman took part in securing the approval of the House for the pernicious parts of the dreadful 1982 Act, a great deal has happened. If we continue the 1982 arrangements indefinitely, the prospects for the country are horrific. We seek to protect the national interest by moving away from an arrangement that may not have been proper in 1982 because the situation in 1985 is very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) gave ample grounds for the Committee to approve the two new clauses. He recognised the enormous changes in trading. He described the absurd, highly complicated and utterly unnecessary patterns of trading—the nonsense of one cargo of oil spending its life being sold by one company to another and back again three times over and twice squared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished to see the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North nodding in blissful approval of such an absurd pattern of activity. He would probably approve of a story that I was told the other day, in which a man was accosted in a public house in one of the shadier parts of London and sold a case of sardines for £2. The following day, he went into the same pub and sold it to someone else for £5. The day after that,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
it was again sold, this time for £20. The day after that the man who had paid £20 said, "I tasted those sardines last night and they were horrible." The man from whom he had bought them said, "You are not supposed to eat them. They exist, for trading."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oil does not exist for trading; it exists to provide essential fuel. But the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North seems to have lost sight of that. He seems to think that oil is pumped out of the North sea so that people can make a lot of money selling it to one another and then buying it back again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is more concerned with the need to provide the Government with revenue than with the need to meet customers' requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has heard me speak in many energy debates. If he has any memory at all, he will acknowledge that for the past 12 years my first priority has been a proper and intelligent depletion policy, with the acceptance that conservation has a role to play in the management of our offshore resource. The hon. Gentleman would get rid of it all tomorrow if someone could make a profit out of it, and be hanged to the national interest in 10 or 20 years' time. The national interest has always dominated my attitude and that of my hon. Friends, but I am sorry to say there is no evidence that it has penetrated the hon. Gentleman's consciousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the situation is changing so rapidly, the new clause is not merely wise but essential. It might have been valuable in 1982; in 1985, it is invaluable. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney spoke of a possible rapid fall in prices. If there is to be a rapid fall, it is as well for the nation to have a parachute. But the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North would have Britain fall simply because of the possibility that the parachute was produced in the public sector. He would rather die than abandon his dogmatic political approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is perfectly sensible. It recognises the appalling and rapid change that is taking place and confers a parachute on the Department of Energy, which will want to give the Minister good advice. But the Department will require its own sources, and we are trying to ensure that it is well sourced. If the Minister accepts the new clause, the agency's residual responsibilities will require it to retain people who can provide good information and advice. But Conservative Members seem concerned to ensure that the Minister receives only very restricted advice. No one in his right mind in a modern civilisation would seek to prevent a Minister of the Crown from having relevant information and good advice, except Conservative Members and particularly the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has spent his time revising an enactment of 1982; I suggest that he reads new clause 3 instead. The amendment would entitle the agency in each election period—we are not, of course, talking about either the Brecon and Radnor by-election or the Government's prospects in October 1987—to a proportion of up to 51 per cent of oil. We are not saying that it should all be nationalised and that we should not give people the opportunity to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
maintain their employment in selling cargoes of oil, whether in public houses in London or elsewhere. We are talking about giving the agency and the Government the capacity to act in a decisive and mature manner. There was a reference to 30 days, which means that we are not acting with undue haste. We are serving the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 is entirely responsible and intelligent. Although the fall in prices may be on a steep gradient, it will stop sometime. At that point, when the world recognises that the price of oil has dropped to the level in real terms which led Europe into an over-dependence on oil consumption, OPEC will have the same power that it enjoyed in 1973 and 1979. Only 10 or 15 per cent of the oil reserves Britain once enjoyed will be left, so the Government will need to begin to harness and harvest their oil resources with much more intelligence than the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) has consistently displayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will need to have advice, as the available oil reserves will have contracted to the point where we shall be far less concerned with allowing people to sell and buy it 24 times over, than with making sure that we get every penny's worth of value from a resource which we can see rapidly disappearing. If the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North has his way, the Government will not be able to act with wisdom or receive confirming information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past three years, the trading system has become much more complex. It may be unusual today for a cargo to be bought and sold 24 times—in 10 years time, it may be 240. The hon. Gentleman might like to intervene in the market and conceivably make a profit. If one is buying and selling that much, the profit will be enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the difficulty is that the profits will accrue outside the United Kingdom. Many people who have nothing to do with Britain and have no interest in it are making profit. The new clause would give the Government greater intelligence. As we want them to be intelligent—plainly Conservative Members do not—I hope that the new clause will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges it. He criticises my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) when he does speak and when he does not. Perhaps it is good that we are coming to the end of the Committee. My hon. Friends and I had suspicions about the attitude of Opposition Members throughout the Committee, which are now confirmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth was extraordinary. He criticised my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North for not being prepared to accept change, but he is the person who is accepting change in the Bill. It is the hon. Member for Wentworth and his hon. Friends who are standing in the way of change and alterations in the oil market generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that it is my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
for Bedfordshire, North and our other hon. Friends who are the radicals here, pioneering change instead of living in ages past, hoping that things will stay the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two important elements in the new clauses. The first is the information and advice that is available to the Secretary of State, and the other is the possibility of having a price published by the new agency which might be helpful, particularly as a tax reference and as a marker point for tax revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North said about information and advice. The power existed under the 1975 Act and was subsequently repealed in the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982. There was nothing wrong in the Opposition seeking to reinstate that power. I do not argue with their view that it is necessary for the Secretary of State to have the best possible information and advice about the oil market and prices, but I do not think that those need come from the agency. Parliament decided that information and advice should not come from BNOC, as the Secretary of State has many other sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, for example, the model clauses in the petroleum licences which form part of the statutory framework for the regulation of the industry. They give the Secretary of State direct powers to regulate the operations of the oil companies and to obtain information on their licence activities. In addition, my Department consults the oil companies on a wide variety of subjects and has done so for many years. The companies have proved a satisfactory source of information on petroleum pricing and market trends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has, we have access to published material; we also have information from post abroad, and we have access to reports from independent consultants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For six years we have found no need to use BNOC in a special advisory capacity, and I believe that the abolition of the corporation will have no significant impact on Government's knowledge of what is happening in the oil industry. I do not therefore think that any useful purpose would be served in reviving a specific advisory role for the agency. For that reason, I could not accept new clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said in his introductory remarks on new clause 4, we discussed the subject of the new clause on Second Reading. We paid tribute then, and I happily do so again, to the useful role played by BNOC in providing transparent evidence of arm's length prices for North sea oil. As I said then and reiterate today, that depended on having contract sales at term prices. As changes in market structure have shifted the balance against trading in participation oil, so they have changed BNOC's role in discovering a market price that could be used for taxation purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I explain how this important function works. Our tax legislation is based on the principle that for sales between unconnected parties, tax should be assessed on the actual prices received. That is a fundamental principle of our tax system. Where there are sales between subsidiaries and other sales of a non arm's length nature, the tax should be assessed at the market value. That principle is enshrined not only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
in our tax law but in OECD conventions and in numerous double taxation treaties. We depart from that tax principle at our peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market value of oil is defined in the Oil Taxation Act 1975 as the price at which the oil could have been sold to a willing buyer in a sale at arm's length. Given the considerable growth in arm's length spot sales, the Oil Taxation Office is confident that it will have sufficient evidence of the market to make price assessments in the changed circumstances. Obviously that is a complicated area, and the Oil Taxation Office is consulting the oil companies about how the revised arrangement will work. However, it has not suggested that any role for the agency will be appropriate or desirable: it is confident that it can perform its role as required under the Oil Taxation Act effectively without the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is another fundamental point which I must make to the Committee, and it was touched upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North. Any reference price which came to be published in the way that the new clause requires would inevitably become known as the United Kingdom official price. Publication of such prices would expose the agency and the Government to international pressure and the prices would assume far greater significance than they merited, particularly if they were some weeks behind the market instead of being up to date. All that would be much better avoided. For those reasons, I ask my hon. Friends to reject the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the Minister reading out the catalogue of sources for his information, I am astonished how he got it so badly wrong in the last few months. If he had all that published information, all those sources of alternative evidence and if he could talk to the oil companies and so on, how did he get it so wrong in the last 12 months in his attitudes on policy and pricing? The cost of that in a Supplementary Estimate was more than £66 million. The Minister said that he abandoned the proposals six years ago and that nothing had happened. In the last five or six years the Government have got all their oil and energy policies hopelessly wrong. The absence of this information and advice has contributed to those mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am heartened because the case for these two new clauses is strengthened by the Minister's comments. Without new clause 4, the Bill will be a charter for tax avoidance. The notion that the Oil Taxation Office will talk to the oil companies as if they were on the same side is wrong. They are on opposing sides. The new clause is needed as extra support and to provide a clear independent view about the basis on which oil companies should be taxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that the Minister should finish the Committee stage as he began it, in a state of total complacency. He is complacent about the future of the oil market. He is complacent about the role that he and other Ministers at the Department of the Energy will have. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) described BNOC as a piece of timber floating on the water. The Minister and the Department of Energy will be floating helplessly without any real support or backing and without an oil corporation which owes its allegiance to the nation and the Government of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
In the absence of that, the Minister's complacency will become increasingly evident. That complacency has run through his replies in almost all our debates. I ask my hon. Friends to vote for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
